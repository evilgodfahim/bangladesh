      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Feb 10 - China’s influence in Bangladesh, boosted by the 2024 ouster of New Delhi‑aligned leader Sheikh Hasina, is likely to deepen after this week&apos;s election, although politicians and analysts say India is too large a neighbour to be sidelined completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PSL franchise Multan Sultans sold for record Rs2.45bn; new owner says name will be changed to Rawalpindi</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972074/psl-franchise-multan-sultans-sold-for-record-rs245bn-new-owner-says-name-will-be-changed-to-rawalpindi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Super League franchise (PSL) Multan Sultans on Monday was sold to Walee Technologies for a record Rs2.45 billion ahead of the tournament’s 11th edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the auction in Lahore, show host Fakhr-i-Alam informed bidders that the winning bid would also cover the annual fee to maintain ownership of the team for the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MultanSultans/status/2020864897551106059&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the auction ceremony, the new owner of the team announced that they would be changing the name to Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you ready for a surprise? We will be going for Rawalpindi!” announced the company’s chief executive officer, Ahsan Tahir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the ceremony, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi congratulated Walee Technologies on their successful bid and expressed gratitude to former board chairman Najam Sethi for his vision for the Multan Sultans franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Multan Sultans was created by Najam Sethi &lt;em&gt;sahib&lt;/em&gt;; we are so pleased he is with us today,” Naqvi said, inviting Sethi onto the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Sethi said, “I’m obviously delighted to be here; this is the culmination of a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m obviously over the moon that it’s come through under Mohsin Naqvi, who is a dear, dear friend of mine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sethi hailed the winning bid as a “great moment for Pakistan cricket”, adding that Naqvi would give good news “beyond PSL” over the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, at a press conference with representatives from Walee Technologies, Naqvi said that the future of the Multan Sultans brand would have to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot ask the person paying Rs2.45bn to keep the name Multan Sultans,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we discussed auctioning Multan Sultans, we planned to keep it for one or two years. But there was a good environment in the market and we were already auctioning five or six teams,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCB chief noted that there were concerns, given the brand’s age and the possibility of damage to its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, Multan Sultans is very close to my heart, so we will come up with a solution,” Naqvi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about the criteria for setting the opening bid at Rs1.82bn, he replied that it was the second-highest bid for the Sialkot team, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965821&quot;&gt;sold&lt;/a&gt; for Rs1.85bn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a question about ongoing meetings with a delegation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Pakistan’s boycott of the match with India in the T20 World Cup, Naqvi replied, “The issue was Bangladesh’s. We did not want to let their point of view go; they are our brothers and you saw the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things are happening, which is why I won’t say much, but the ICC and the Bangladesh board are in that phase where if I say anything, it won’t be right. We’ll update you once we receive information,” the PCB chief said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi said that “guests need to be respected” when asked about the attitude of the visiting ICC delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walee Technologies is a global company specialising in projects in the media, finance and technology sectors, according to their &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://walee.pk/about-walee/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, which added that the company had also earlier acquired PSL livestreaming rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Multan franchise, started in 2017, competed in eight consecutive editions of the PSL, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1631329&quot;&gt;winning &lt;/a&gt;the league in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, the franchise was left &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957302&quot;&gt;ownerless &lt;/a&gt;after the PCB did not extend a renewal offer to owner Ali Khan Tareen. The PCB then announced it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963738&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;take over&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the franchise for the upcoming tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bids were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966930&quot;&gt;invited &lt;/a&gt;on January 14 and their technical evaluation was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970696&quot;&gt;completed &lt;/a&gt;by February 3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan to play T20 World Cup match against India, govt announces</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The government announced on Monday that Pakistan would play the T20 World Cup match against India, scheduled for February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to play the match comes after a delegation from the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt; in the country over the weekend and held meetings with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match against India. It also came hours after Sri Lanka urged Pakistan to play India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on X, the government said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was formally briefed by PCB Chairman Naqvi regarding the outcomes of high-level deliberations held between the PCB, representatives of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the BCB, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GovtofPakistan/status/2020922168406835257&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government further noted the statement by BCB President Aminul Islam. The profound gratitude expressed by our brotherly nation is received with great warmth. Pakistan reaffirms that it stands shoulder to shoulder with Bangladesh,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It noted that PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During their warm and friendly conversation, they recalled that Pakistan and Sri Lanka had always stood shoulder to shoulder, especially during challenging times. The Sri Lankan president requested the prime minister to accord serious consideration to amicably resolve the current impasse,” the government said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In view of the outcomes achieved in multilateral discussions, as well as the request of friendly countries, the government of Pakistan hereby directs the Pakistan national cricket team to take the field on February 15, 2026, for its scheduled fixture in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this decision has been taken with the aim of protecting the spirit of cricket, and to support the continuity of this global sport in all participating nations,” the government said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The prime minister and the people of Pakistan extend their best wishes to the Men in Green. We remain confident that our team will carry the spirit of sportsmanship and national pride onto the field as they compete for global glory,” the government said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reacting to the post, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said, “Game &lt;em&gt;on hai&lt;/em&gt; (the game is on)!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole nation stands behind the men in green. Great decision by the PM Shehbaz and great diplomacy by PCB chairman,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called PM Shehbaz earlier in the day, thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As co-host of the tournament, Sri Lanka thanks the ICC and all concerned for their efforts. Sri Lanka hasn’t forgotten the solidarity shown by both India and Pakistan during the 1996 World Cup, when they played in Colombo at a time when others refrained due to security concerns,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Sri Lankan President Dissanayake had urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India. He made the request during a phone call with PM Shehbaz, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan fully supported Sri Lankan cricket during terrorism in Sri Lanka,” he was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan gave priority to its long-standing relations with Sri Lanka above all else, and the Pakistani cricket team continued to tour the country to play cricket despite terrorism,” Dissanayake said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier welcomed the Sri Lankan president’s sentiments and noted how Colombo also stood with Islamabad during difficult times and kept cricket going in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Recently, the Sri Lankan team took an unforgettable step for the Pakistani nation and cricket fans by not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1954722&quot;&gt;cancelling the tour of Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, PM Shehbaz said he would inform the Sri Lankan president about a “final decision” regarding the Pak-India match after consultations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the match against India. In the statement shared by state-run &lt;em&gt;PTV&lt;/em&gt; on X, the BCB expressed gratitude to the PCB and ICC for their “positive roles in trying to overcome recent challenges”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He particularly thanked the PCB, its chairman and cricket fans in Pakistan for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Throughout this period, the PCB has demonstrated exemplary sportsmanship and solidarity,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting BCB President Islam, the statement read, “We are deeply moved by Pakistan’s efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,” Islam added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#no-penalty-on-bangladesh-for-opting-out-of-world-cup-icc&quot; id=&quot;no-penalty-on-bangladesh-for-opting-out-of-world-cup-icc&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;No penalty on Bangladesh for opting out of World Cup: ICC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the ICC said that it would not impose any penalty on the BCB for opting out of the T20 World Cup and also agreed that the country would host an ICC event prior to the 2031 tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the ICC said that it had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; an “open, constructive and congenial dialogue” with PCB and BCB officials, saying that the meeting was not limited to the tournament in India, but the “broader outlook for cricket in South Asia”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While reflecting on the Bangladesh cricket team’s unfortunate absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the global governing body for cricket reaffirmed BCB’s position as a valued full member, with a proud cricketing history and a vital role in the growth of the global game,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ICC/status/2020916613462229482&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement reiterated the ICC’s continued facilitation of growth in one of cricket’s “most vibrant” markets, with more than 200 million passionate fans, to ensure that Bangladesh’s non-participation in the tournament did not have any long-term effects on cricket in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing the highlights of the dialogue with BCB and PCB officials, the statement said that it reflected “a forward-looking alignment reached in good faith” and was “intended to provide clarity on the current position of the stakeholders”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further mentioned that these outcomes did not “alter, qualify or detract from the ICC’s constitutional autonomy, governance framework or established decision-making processes”, all of which remained fully applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governing body added that it was agreed that “no financial, sporting or administrative penalty will be imposed on [the] BCB” in relation to the current matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is acknowledged that BCB retains the right to approach the dispute resolution committee should it choose to do so. This right exists under current ICC regulations and remains intact,” it stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement noted that the ICC’s approach was guided by its principles of neutrality and fairness and reflected the shared objective of facilitative support rather than punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, all the parties reached an agreement that Bangladesh would host an ICC event prior to the Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2031, “subject to the usual ICC hosting processes, timelines and operational requirements”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This reflects confidence in Bangladesh’s capability as a host and reinforces the ICC’s commitment to providing meaningful hosting opportunities across its membership to develop cricket in the country,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that the governing body, the Pakistani and Bangladeshi boards and other members remained committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity,” the statement read&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC Chief Executive Sanjog Gupta was quoted as saying, “Bangladesh’s absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is regrettable but it does not alter the ICC’s enduring commitment to Bangladesh as a core cricketing nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our focus continues to be on working closely with key stakeholders, including BCB, to ensure the sport grows sustainably in the country and that future opportunities for its players and fans are strengthened,” Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further added that Bangladesh remained a priority cricket ecosystem deserving of long-term investment in its development, competitiveness and global integration, and was not defined by short-term disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the government had given &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision had come after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be mentioned that Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan to play T20 World Cup clash against India: state- run media</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-clash-against-india-state-run-media</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has agreed to play the match against India in the T20 World Cup, state-run Pakistan TV reported on Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on the social media platform X, the broadcaster said: “Pakistan has agreed to play the T20 World Cup match against India on February 15, following requests from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, with India accepting Pakistan’s preconditions”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PakTVGlobal/status/2020904422017225115&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development came shortly after Sri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India. He made the request during a phone call with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan fully supported Sri Lankan cricket during terrorism in Sri Lanka,” he was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan gave priority to its long-standing relations with Sri Lanka above all else, and the Pakistani cricket team continued to tour the country to play cricket despite terrorism,” Dissanayake said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier welcomed the Sri Lankan president’s sentiments and noted how Colombo also stood with Islamabad during difficult times and kept cricket going in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Recently, the Sri Lankan team took an unforgettable step for the Pakistani nation and cricket fans by not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1954722&quot;&gt;cancelling the tour of Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, PM Shehbaz said he would inform the Sri Lankan president about a “final decision” regarding the Pak-India match after consultations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#bangladesh-cricket-board-thanks-pcb-for-support-urges-them-to-play-match&quot; id=&quot;bangladesh-cricket-board-thanks-pcb-for-support-urges-them-to-play-match&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bangladesh Cricket Board thanks PCB for support, urges them to play match&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) thanked the PCB for its solidarity, while BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the February 15 match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB expressed gratitude to the PCB and ICC for their “positive roles in trying to overcome recent challenges”, particularly thanking the PCB, its Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and cricket fans in Pakistan for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Throughout this period, the PCB has demonstrated exemplary sportsmanship and solidarity,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting BCB President Islam, the statement read, “We are deeply moved by Pakistan’s efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,” Islam added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government had given &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision had come after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, a delegation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt; in the country and held meetings with PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be mentioned that Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh’s election campaign entered its final day on Monday before this week’s vote, with rival parties invoking the 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.
Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters attended a succession of rival rallies across the sprawling capital Dhaka, as parties sought to harness the legacy of the mass uprising and pitch competing visions of change for the country of 170 million in Thursday’s election.
The South Asian nation will elect a 350-seat...</description>

      <title>Scotland spoil Italy’s T20 World Cup debut with big win</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972064/scotland-spoil-italys-t20-world-cup-debut-with-big-win</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;T20 World Cup debutants Italy had a bruising introduction to cricket’s biggest stage as they suffered a crushing 73-run loss to Scotland on Monday in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland piled up 207-4 with opener George Munsey top-scoring with 84 and in reply, Italy were bowled out for 134 in 16.4 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off-spinner Michael Leask took 4-17 for Scotland, adding to his batting cameo of an unbeaten 22 off five balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nation better known for its football, Italy are the lowest-ranked side in the 20-team tournament and were making a slice of history here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chasing a mammoth 208 for victory, they suffered early blows before a valiant fourth-wicket partnership of 73 between Australia-born brothers Ben and Harry Manenti kept them afloat at Eden Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CricketScotland/status/2020782307871965359&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Harry departed for 37 and Ben got out after his 31-ball 52 as the Italian batting collapsed from 113-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully we’ll sit down at some stage and reflect on that little partnership that we had and it would have been nice to contribute to a win there,” said vice-captain Harry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called playing with his brother “special”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obviously growing up and playing backyard cricket with him, batting together, and as young kids then dreaming of being at a World Cup batting together and we’ve got to live that out today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa-born captain Wayne Madsen could not bat after he dislocated his shoulder while fielding and might miss the rest of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland skipper Richie Berrington said it was vital for them to bounce back after losing their opening match of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Really pleased to get our first win. In the end it was a comprehensive win, but we had to work hard for it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland originally failed to qualify for the World Cup but with only two weeks to go, they replaced Bangladesh, who were kicked out after they refused to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#madsen-heartbreak&quot; id=&quot;madsen-heartbreak&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Madsen heartbreak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy won the toss and bowled in the Group C encounter, where there were a few Italian fans decked out in the country’s blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland rode on a 126-run opening stand between Munsey and Michael Jones, who hit 37, to post the highest total in the tournament so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon McMullen with an unbeaten 18-ball 41 and Leask, who hit two fours and two sixes in the last five balls, took Scotland to their best T20 World Cup total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-handed Munsey started briskly with a flurry of fours to unsettle Italy’s attack in the first six overs of the powerplay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CricketScotland/status/2020766884057190703&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy suffered a blow when Madsen fell awkwardly while trying to stop a boundary in the fourth over and went off the field wincing in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His shoulder has been put back in place by the physio but he will undergo scans and is “doubtful” for the rest of the tournament, Italy coach John Davison said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The captain still completed an unusual World Cup double on Monday — playing in two different sports for two separate countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He played at the field hockey World Cup for his native South Africa, but holds an Italian passport now through his ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munsey, who was dropped on 40 by Anthony Mosca, reached his fifty in 30 balls with a six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munsey missed out on a hundred after he holed out to long-on off pace bowler Grant Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hit 13 fours and two sixes in his 54-ball knock to lead Scotland to their first group win, after they lost their first match to the West Indies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Feb 9 - For years under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s opposition had little presence on the streets during elections, either boycotting polls or being sidelined by mass arrests of senior leaders. Now, ahead of Thursday’s vote, the roles have reversed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ICC, PCB officials meet in Lahore to discuss Pakistan’s boycotted match with India on Feb 15</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869/icc-pcb-officials-meet-in-lahore-to-discuss-pakistans-boycotted-match-with-india-on-feb-15</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Pakistan and Bangladesh cricket boards was held at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; the T20 World Cup match with India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was still in progress until late Sunday night, while the ICC, as well as the two cricket boards, decided not to speak to the media regarding the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a four-hour meeting, no joint declaration was issued. Per sources, there was a break for a late-night dinner, and a second round of talks was scheduled after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that the main concern of the PCB expressed during the meeting was related to the “politics rampant at a large-scale level across the ICC affairs and India’s excessive involvement in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) influence over the ICC decisions was not acceptable to Pakistan, according to a PCB source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that the ICC had “nothing to offer to Bangladesh as compensation but to ensure it would get a full share from the ICC earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources further said ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja advised the PCB to “move its case before the ICC arbitration committee or bring it up during the ICC board meeting, and end the boycott of the India-Pakistan match forthwith, as it was not good for cricket.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the evening, Khawaja landed in Lahore to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived to partake in some meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Naqvi welcomed Islam at Gaddafi Stadium, where the two held a meeting to discuss the “ongoing crisis”, the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB president thanked Pakistan for its “support” in the T20 World Cup matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mir and Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — were also present during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was welcomed earlier at the Lahore airport by Naseer and other officials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-level visits come a day after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;ICC Men’s T20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;remained firm&lt;/a&gt; on not taking part in the event after the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969929/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave its cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which should also be the responsibility of all its member,s including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;edged out the Netherlands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kamindu heroics steer Sri Lanka past Ireland in T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971881/kamindu-heroics-steer-sri-lanka-past-ireland-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s 11th-hour call to draft in Kamindu Mendis proved a masterstroke as the all-rounder produced a match-turning cameo to set up a 20-run win over Ireland in their T20 World Cup opener at Colombo’s R. Premadasa Stadium on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamindu’s blistering 44 off 19 balls with four fours and two sixes gave Sri Lanka the late thrust they badly needed to post 163.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spin trio of Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga and Dunith Wellalage then ran through the Irish middle order, sharing seven wickets to seal a comfortable victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just wanted to score a few boundaries and put a partnership with Kusal Mendis,” said Kamindu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kusal was outstanding today. He deserves a lot of credit. We wanted someone to bat through the innings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They played well during the run chase until the 15th over. We had to keep our calm and we knew they had to take risks and we bowled well towards the end.” Hasaranga claimed three wickets to take his World Cup tally to 40, second only to Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan, who has 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were anxious moments when the leg-spinner, who has a history with hamstring injuries, limped off after his second over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he returned to complete his quota, he moved gingerly, raising questions over his fitness for the rest of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s innings had been stuck in first gear until Kamindu strode in with the scoreboard reading 86 for four in the 14th over, boundaries having dried up against Ireland’s spinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-hander broke a 57-ball boundary drought with a cheeky reverse sweep and then went into overdrive, plundering 21 runs in the 17th over to wrestle back the momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Kusal Mendis playing the sheet anchor role in an unbeaten half-century, Sri Lanka found a competitive total from what had looked like a below-par platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland were marshalled by left-arm spinner George Dockrell, who returned a miserly spell of 2-17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 49-run stand between Lorcan Tucker and Harry Tector for the third wicket kept Ireland in the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a promising 105 for two, Ireland lost their way and folded for 143 in 19.5 overs with Matheesha Pathirana cleaning up with two wickets in the final over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They got 15 runs too many,” said Ireland captain Paul Sterling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bit sloppy in the field and we have plenty of work to do before the next game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were confident with plenty of wickets in hand, but Sri Lanka held their nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Spin is a challenge for us. It wasn’t coming onto the bat as much as we expected. Spin, I believe, is going to play a big role in this tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former champions Sri Lanka are co-hosting the 20-nation showpiece alongside defending champions India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh faces rise in Islamist politics after uprising, says report</title>

      <description>A new report highlights concerns over rising Islamist politics in Bangladesh after the July 2024 uprising. Researchers suggest this shift could negatively affect women and minorities. The analysis indicates a move towards right-wing ideology, with previously suppressed Islamist groups gaining prominence. This transition may introduce formal and informal Islamic governance, posing challenges for women&apos;s rights in the country.</description>

      <title>ICC deputy chair, Bangladesh Cricket Board president land in Lahore; both set to meet Naqvi</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869/icc-deputy-chair-bangladesh-cricket-board-president-land-in-lahore-both-set-to-meet-naqvi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;International Cricket Council (ICC) Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam separately landed in Lahore on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said the guest will hold a meeting with PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who also serves as the interior minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an earlier PCB press release, the BCB president will also meet with Naqvi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was welcomed at the airport by Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — and other officials.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-level visits come a day after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;ICC Men’s T20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;remained firm&lt;/a&gt; on not taking part in the event after the International Cricket Council (ICC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969929/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave its cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC in a statement said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup which should also be the responsibility of all its members including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;edged out the Netherlands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh Cricket Board president lands in Lahore, set to meet PCB chief Naqvi</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869/bangladesh-cricket-board-president-lands-in-lahore-set-to-meet-pcb-chief-naqvi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam on Sunday landed in Lahore and is set to hold multiple meetings, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was welcomed at the airport by Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chief — and other officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the PCB press release, Islam will hold a meeting with PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who also serves as the interior minister.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheRealPCBMedia/status/2020450873798013129&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB chief’s visit comes a day after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;ICC Men’s T20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;remained firm&lt;/a&gt; on not taking part in the event after the International Cricket Council (ICC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969929/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave its cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC in a statement said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup which should also be the responsibility of all its members including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;edged out the Netherlands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We will not give employment to any foreigner.&quot;</description>

      <title>Crunch Point For World Cricket: Power Politics And Double Standards Unfairly Rob Bangladesh Of Participation</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/crunch-point-world-cricket-power-politics-and-double-standards-unfairly-rob-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Bangladesh’s absence from the 10th edition of the T20 World Cup was the result of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/video/game-theory/2026/1/30/aje-onl-bangladesh_v6-1-300126&quot;&gt;the BCCI’s ego and the ICC’s double standards&lt;/a&gt; where power politics and selective decision-making outweighed fairness and sporting integrity. Although many view the Pakistan Cricket Board’s support for Bangladesh positively, in reality it is also a strategic move to counter India for its own strategic benefit. If the match is boycotted, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/cricket/401784/bangladesh-face-heavy-financial-fallout-after-t20&quot;&gt;Bangladesh will suffer even greater financial and administrative losses. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Controversial remarks in Bangladesh by a politician who questioned women’s ability to perform jobs because of their child-bearing role have caused an uproar ahead of the general election in a country where female workers form the spine of its mainstay garment sector.
Shafiqur Rahman, the chief of the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, also ruled out the possibility of a woman assuming the Islamist party’s top post.
In a TV interview, Rahman said women with babies should be given the option of fewer...</description>

      <title>Bangladesh keen on buying rolling stocks</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971817/bangladesh-keen-on-buying-rolling-stocks</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Bangladesh has expressed keen interest in procuring freight wagons and passenger coaches after Pakistan offered the rolling stock at prices cheaper than those in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-member delegation, headed by a senior Bangladeshi official, has also visited the Pakistan Railways (PR) carriage factory in Islamabad and the Mughalpura Workshop in Lahore to receive a briefing from the railway authorities and to witness the rolling stock manufacturing process, &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; has learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Lahore-based PR authorities, Mr Farhad Islam, Bangladesh’s Secretary for International Organisations and Consular Affairs and Designate D-8 Commissioner and Mohammad Iqbal Hussain Khan, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan, visited the Mughalpura workshop on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Nasir Khalili, Chief Mechanical Engineer (Carriage and Wagons), briefed the delegation on the overall functioning, technical capabilities, and ongoing projects of the PR’s workshops. A short documentary highlighting the workshops’ operational and working strengths was also shown to the guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Railways offers attractive prices to seal export deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Khalili stated that Pakistan and Bangladesh are brotherly countries sharing a common history, culture, and heritage, and that there exists immense potential for cooperation between the two nations, particularly in the railway sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delegation was subsequently given a detailed tour of the Mughalpura Locomotive Workshop, where they were briefed on the various stages of locomotive maintenance, rehabilitation, and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diplomats termed their visit informative, productive, and encouraging, and appreciated the technical expertise and professional competence of Pakistan Railways. “Our visit stands as a clear testament to the strengthening bonds of friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh,” said Mr Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi has expressed his resolve to advance railway-to-railway cooperation between the two countries, emphasising that such collaboration can yield substantial benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PR is currently supplying coaches and wagons to four countries with broad-gauge rail networks — Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chile and Argentina. ““It reflects that we have achieved modern, indigenous manufacturing capability for coaches and wagons,” the minister said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next phase, according to Mr Khalili, the railway experts from Bangladesh will also visit Pakistan for a detailed technical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, Pakistan Railways exported rolling stock to Bangladesh while it provided freight wagons to Sri Lanka in 1999 and 2000 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current regional context, Pakistan is emerging as a suitable and cost-effective alternative to other international suppliers for Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh was dealing with India regarding the provision of wagons and coaches. But now Dhaka has shown its interest in us for this purpose,” Mr Khalili told Dawn when contacted. He said the delegation also visited the Islamabad carriage factory a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shepherd takes hat-trick as West Indies beat Scotland in T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971704/shepherd-takes-hat-trick-as-west-indies-beat-scotland-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pace bowler Romario Shepherd took the first hat-trick of the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup on Saturday to help the West Indies blow away Scotland’s tail and win by 35 runs in their Group C opener in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shepherd grabbed a sensational four wickets in five balls in the 17th over to put an end to Scotland’s hopes of chasing their target of 183.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimron Hetmyer’s 36-ball 64 at Eden Gardens earlier propelled the West Indies to 182-5 in their 20 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scots, who only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971513/excited-scots-out-to-prove-they-deserve-last-minute-call-up&quot;&gt;received &lt;/a&gt;a call-up two weeks ago to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replace Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, were threatening a famous victory at 114-3 at the end of the 13th over, with big-hitting captain Richie Berrington and Tom Bruce at the crease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 78-run fourth-wicket partnership between Berrington, who made 42, and Tom Bruce (35) had put them back in the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But strikes by Jason Holder and then Shepherd’s burst saw Scotland bowled out for 147.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sheppie, he is one of those guys who is willing to learn and improve,” West Indies captain Shai Hope told reporters. “He is always willing to put his hand up, whatever the team requires of him, whether with bat or ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is kind of versatile for us in the middle overs, and it’s good to see him starting the tournament with a bang, and hopefully he will continue doing the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shepherd removed Matthew Cross, for 11, Michael Leask and Oliver Davidson and celebrated wildly before ending with an impressive 5-20 from his three overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holder finished with figures of 3-30 in 3.5 overs as he wrapped up the Scotland innings in 18.5 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s obviously been great to get a feel for the conditions here,” said Berrington, whose side have a quick turnaround as they face Italy at the same ground on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So I’d say there’s definitely a lot of positives we can take from today. And we need to take that into our next game in a couple of days’ time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#six-hitting-hetmyer&quot; id=&quot;six-hitting-hetmyer&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Six-hitting Hetmyer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scots won the toss and elected to field and initially had the West Indies on the back foot with some disciplined bowling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opener Brandon King made 35 as he cut loose in the seventh over to hit pace bowler Safyaan Sharif for a six and two fours off successive balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland rotated their bowlers and Leask struck the first blow with his off-spin as he bowled Hope for 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King was out next, falling to debutant left-arm spinner Davidson, caught at backward point for his maiden T20 wicket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-handed Hetmyer took on the opposition attack, hitting six sixes in all, and put on a stand of 81 off 37 balls with Rovman Powell, who made 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetmyer, who was named player of the match, reached his fifty off 22 balls with a six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powell was dismissed, but he kept up the attack with fellow left-hander Sherfane Rutherford, who scored a 13-ball 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetmyer fell to Sharif with Brandon McMullen taking a stunning catch at long-on and Rutherford followed him on the first ball of the next over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left-arm pace bowler Brad Currie returned figures of 2-23.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PCB denies approaching ICC over Pakistan-India T20 World Cup match</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971692/pcb-denies-approaching-icc-over-pakistan-india-t20-world-cup-match</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday denied approaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) in connection with the team’s boycott of the match against India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on the social media platform X, the PCB issued a statement attributed to its spokesperson, Amir Mir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I categorically reject the claim by Indian sports journalist Vikrant Gupta that the PCB approached the ICC,” Mir was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, earlier in the day, had posted on X that the PCB had “reached out to the ICC for dialogue”. He had alleged that after the ICC wrote back to the PCB regarding the legal ramifications it could face, the board approached the cricket world body for talks to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vikrantgupta73/status/2020108628850798979&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As usual, sections of the Indian media are busy circulating fiction. A little patience and time will clearly show who actually went knocking and who didn’t,” PCB spokesperson Mir said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheRealPCB/status/2020171907228996078&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that earlier on Saturday, &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; had reported a source close to the developments as saying that the PCB had reached out to the ICC after a formal communication from the cricket world body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC was seeking a resolution through dialogue and not confrontation, the source added, according to &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968499&quot;&gt;refused &lt;/a&gt;to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replaced &lt;/a&gt;by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a protest, Pakistan refused to face co-hosts India in their Group A fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;edged out Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said this week that his team would travel to Colombo for the clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;asked &lt;/a&gt;Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) is in talks with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to resolve the boycott of its T20 World Cup match against India on February 15, &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; learnt on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WHO says one person dead from Nipah virus in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971619/who-says-one-person-dead-from-nipah-virus-in-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization said on Friday that a woman had died in northern Bangladesh in January after contracting the deadly Nipah virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case in Bangladesh, where Nipah cases are reported almost every year, follows two Nipah virus cases&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969509&quot;&gt; identified&lt;/a&gt; in neighbouring India, which has already prompted stepped-up airport screenings across Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient in Bangladesh, aged between 40 and 50 years, developed symptoms consistent with Nipah virus on January 21, including fever and headache followed by hypersalivation, disorientation and convulsion, the WHO added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She died a week later and was confirmed to be infected with the virus a day later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person had no travel history but had a history of consuming raw date palm sap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 35 people who had contact with the patient are being monitored and have tested negative for the virus, and no further cases have been detected to date, the WHO said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nipah is an infection that spreads mainly through products contaminated by infected bats, such as fruit. It can be fatal in up to 75 per cent of cases, but it does not spread easily between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries including Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969545&quot;&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; implemented temperature screenings at airports after India said cases of the virus had been found in West Bengal.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO said on Friday that the risk of international disease spread is considered low and that it does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions based on current information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, four laboratory-confirmed fatal cases were reported in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently no licensed medicines or vaccines specific for the infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Jamaat chief sets sights on premiership after Bangladesh polls</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971535/jamaat-chief-sets-sights-on-premiership-after-bangladesh-polls</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Shafiqur Rahman, the leader of Bangladesh’s largest religious party and prime ministerial hopeful, has contested three elections and lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, he hopes to finally win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters will head to the polls on Thursday (Feb 12) for the first time since a 2024 uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; Sheikh Hasina, who in her 15 years as prime minister suppressed religious parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, a 67-year-old doctor and preacher, hopes his 11-party alliance could deliver him victory, worrying critics and minorities who fear a Jamaat win could come at their expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I stand for moral renewal in society,” Rahman vowed in election promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If successful, the former political prisoner could form the first Jamaat-led government in constitutionally secular Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dressed entirely in white, including a flowing white beard, he cuts a distinctive figure on the campaign trail where his party has put forward only male candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good governance is the foundation of stability, peace and prosperity,” he said, pledging rule-based and corruption-free leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-prime minister Hasina, who is close to India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, went after religious parties and cracked down on extremists, killing scores and arresting hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since her fall, key leaders of parties like the Jamaat have been released from prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Locks’ and brooms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in 1958 in the northeastern district of Moulvibazar, Rahman has been a long-time party activist, running first for parliament in 1996, then again in 2001 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His wife, Ameena Shafiq, is also a doctor, who was selected for one of the seats in parliament reserved for women in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their two daughters and son are also doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As party member and then leader, Rahman’s determined push for power has sparked concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh has long been led by powerful women, including Hasina and her long-time rival, the late three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments Shafiqur Rahman made last year about women’s employment, saying he wanted to encourage stay-at-home mothers, provoked a backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t want to lock women at home we don’t have enough money to buy the locks,” he said at a rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, broom-waving women in Dhaka marched on the streets to symbolically “sweep” him away after a social media post from Rahman had argued women being “pushed out of home in the name of modernity” was “nothing but another form of prostitution”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Pakistan’s squad at this year’s T20 World Cup feels like a team again</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971449/why-pakistans-squad-at-this-years-t20-world-cup-feels-like-a-team-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Coke Studio released ‘&lt;em&gt;Phir Se Game Uthadein&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; an anthem for the ODI World Cup set to happen the same year. It was inspired by Slogett and Carlone’s 1992 anthem ‘Who Rules the World’&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the soundtrack to Pakistan’s first and most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1720494&quot;&gt;fabled major victory in cricket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produced by Strings and sung by Atif Aslam, the song proclaimed “&lt;em&gt;Jeet ki daastaan, phir ho gi jawaan”&lt;/em&gt; to the same tune as “&lt;em&gt;Who’s gonna be number one, who’s gonna take up the cup?”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a dexterity required to mythologise something that has actually happened — Pakistan has done that with the 1992 World Cup. There must have been a time when the historical immediacy of the victory would lend itself as proof that it was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ever since I can remember, the 1992 World Cup has been a pedestalised peak that seems harder and harder to re-mount as the years go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1992 is invoked in every metaphor for victory in Pakistan, sporting or otherwise. It is the incantation we chant when we are inviting good fortune, and the prayer we use to give shape to this imagined fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look for it every time we’re stuck in a quagmire mid-tournament (which is by and large a yearly occurrence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2015 invocation was no different. The words &lt;em&gt;josh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;junoon&lt;/em&gt; were used, as they always are, those abstract ideals of hope and zeal and valour that never fully lend themselves in translations to other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what was perhaps most intriguing about this remake was the fact that a sad follow-up was shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Pakistan was knocked out by Australia (because, of course), the TV and video advertisements that brandished all colours of waving flags a day before were replaced by clips of an imagined aftermath: hung faces in front of projector screens, the green stars and crescents painted on them going flaccid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empty rooftops with stray, limp pieces of confetti sadly billowing in the breeze. A sadder version of the song, essentially saying “we lost, but it’s okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the reprise that particularly tickled my fancy, but the idea that a company producing a hype song for one of the decade’s most anticipated cricketing events had the foresight to produce a version for the sadder, but probably likelier outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like it came as a shock — the campaign included the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1163765&quot;&gt;routine defeat&lt;/a&gt; to India, the fabled 1-4 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1171788/world-cup-campaign-pakistan-merely-lived-up-to-its-billing#:~:text=A%20150%2Drun%20loss%20to%20an%20equally%20unpredictable%20West%20Indies%20side&quot;&gt;collapse &lt;/a&gt;against the West Indies that the country woke up before dawn to witness, and of course, an immediately historicised dropped catch in the quarter final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that Pakistan losing or ungracefully bowing out of a tournament isn’t necessarily an unfamiliar feeling. It is often anticipated, often met with a begrudging acknowledgement: “&lt;em&gt;haan yaar, pata tha yehi hoga.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, I was thirteen years old during that particular World Cup, and while I do remember all the horrors in technicolour, I cannot help but remember the few gleaming specks of joy that somehow muscled their way out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a then 27-year-old Sarfaraz Ahmed playing perhaps the first iconic knock of his career against South Africa, falling short of a half-century by one run, and Pakistan winning a game that it probably shouldn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;

        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan player Sarfraz Ahmed celebrates in a match during the 2015 ICC World Cup. — Reuters/File&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the world, as Wahab Riaz was bowling ball after ball of the spell of his life to Shane Watson, I remember loitering around my school’s staffroom during the quarter final, asking the one teacher who would indulge my classmates and me by giving us an update on the score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each of these trips, we would trundle back to class and take a moment to collectively (mournfully) pray at our desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember realising properly for the first time in my life that all the stretched out, worn out, drawn out cliches about coming back to this team over and over again would be true for my whole life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket feels different now than it did back then — it’s faster and more saturated, with so many more places and people and things involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some form of a “World Cup” every year, and it feels difficult to truly feel what a looming World Cup feels like when one is around the corner every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more recently, the constant uncertainty around cricket has been cause for further disillusionment — a Champions Trophy which was supposed to happen entirely at home &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734&quot;&gt;not having been so&lt;/a&gt;, disappointing showings in 2023 and 2024, and an Asia Cup truncated with political puppet shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into the T20 World Cup, Pakistan is once again at the centre of what looks like a less-than-ideal unfolding: Pakistan has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycotted &lt;/a&gt;the match against India in solidarity with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;against ICC’s inconsistent treatment across teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha addresses a press conference ahead of the ICC Men&amp;rsquo;s T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands, at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 6. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/06202528298086f.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha addresses a press conference ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands, at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 6. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the hybrid-model compromise with India in 2024, which promised neutral venues for both teams in the case of an ICC tournament in either one, Pakistan will be playing its group matches in Colombo, with Sri Lanka being cohosts for the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we have a long history with our good friend Colombo in the rain, and with a fluctuating percentage of rain in the forecast, the possibility of any of Pakistan’s games being washed out is not zero. There is no margin for error. The realistic thing would be to not hope too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, one can’t help but feel like that after a while; the Pakistan side showing up to this World Cup feels like a team again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman Ali Agha’s success at number 3 has unlocked a vein of potential for Pakistan — while his T20 strike rate is around 122, at this position, he has averaged 37 and struck at a solid 168, especially in the recent series against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966516&quot;&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970108&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batting aside, Agha has amassed T20 series wins against South Africa, Australia, West Indies and Bangladesh, in addition to two tri-series wins and leading Pakistan to be the finalists in the Asia Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we speak, Saim Ayub is the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971031&quot;&gt;number one&lt;/a&gt; all-rounder in T20 cricket, and Usman Tariq, with his perfectly legal action, has provided Pakistan’s bowling line-up with a contested but undeniable innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971011/spin-heavy-pakistan-hit-form-but-india-boycott-risks-early-t20-world-cup-exit&quot;&gt;spin arsenal&lt;/a&gt; of Saim, Abrar Ahmed, Usman Tariq, Shadab Khan and Muhammad Nawaz has shaped up to be one of the most promising in the tournament, if the statement 3-0 win against Australia was any indication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All histories up till now have shown that Pakistan’s form before a tournament is just about as untrustworthy as Pakistan’s performances during one — but against all my wisdom, I am compelled to hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, cricket is currently at the mercy of administrative mishaps and Pakistan fans are at the mercy of the Pakistan cricket team. But sometimes it is good to remember that not even the most illustrious of wisdoms and an undeniable breadth of knowledge does not absolve us of this reality: when Pakistan plays cricket, we will be tuning in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this time, the sadder songs will remain in the archives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘Excited’ Scots out to prove they deserve last-minute call-up</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971513/excited-scots-out-to-prove-they-deserve-last-minute-call-up</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;KOLKATA: Scotland spinner Mark Watt said on Friday they were confident of proving they belong at the T20 World Cup, despite only being an eleventh-hour replacement for Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scots failed originally to qualify for the tournament in India and Sri Lanka, but their late call-up will see them face two-time winners the West Indies in Kolkata on Saturday after having only a few days to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh refused to play in India, citing security concerns, and were replaced by the International Cricket Council with Scotland being named as replacement less than two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a frantic dash to India they will also face England, Italy and Nepal in Group ‘C’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Richie Berrington-captained team are determined to make the most of the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I mean, firstly, we’re very sympathetic towards Bangladeshi players, but we still massively believe that we should be here,” veteran left-armer Watt told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We believe that we can beat tea­ms higher ranked than us. So there’s no second guess in our invite into this tournament. We’re all ready to go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scotland will make their fifth consecutive appearance at the T20 World Cup with their best showing in 2021 when they reached the Super 12 stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scots stunned the West Indies in the 2022 edition and Watt said they can do it again at Eden Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re definitely going out there to win,” the 29-year-old said. “We’ve beaten them twice very recently, so I don’t see why we can’t do it again. We’re very confident.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watt said they had received huge support after being parachuted into the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To be honest, if I had to wrap it all up in one word, it’d just be excitement,” he said of the mood in the team camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I mean, how more excited could they be?  They were sitting in their house doing nothing 10 days ago and now they’re in India at a World Cup.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watt added that being fresh and rested could work in Scotland’s favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know, we’ve had a great week here in India and sometimes actually having a break from the game is a good thing,” said Watt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you can overthink too much about, oh, we’re playing against England, we’re playing against West Indies.” Berrington said it had been a whirlwind couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Obviously it has been unique circumstances,” Berrington told reporters at the captains’ press conference in Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There has been a quick turnaround for us. Our preparations probably looked slightly different to some of the other teams. But I think we have been presen­ted with a great opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule of group stage matches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feb 7:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Pakistan’s squad at this year’s T20 world Cup feels like a team again</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971449/why-pakistans-squad-at-this-years-t20-world-cup-feels-like-a-team-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Coke Studio released ‘&lt;em&gt;Phir Se Game Uthadein&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; an anthem for the ODI World Cup set to happen the same year. It was inspired by Slogett and Carlone’s 1992 anthem ‘Who Rules the World’&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the soundtrack to Pakistan’s first and most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1720494&quot;&gt;fabled major victory in cricket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produced by Strings and sung by Atif Aslam, the song proclaimed “&lt;em&gt;Jeet ki daastaan, phir ho gi jawaan”&lt;/em&gt; to the same tune as “&lt;em&gt;Who’s gonna be number one, who’s gonna take up the cup?”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a dexterity required to mythologise something that has actually happened — Pakistan has done that with the 1992 World Cup. There must have been a time when the historical immediacy of the victory would lend itself as proof that it was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ever since I can remember, the 1992 World Cup has been a pedestalised peak that seems harder and harder to re-mount as the years go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1992 is invoked in every metaphor for victory in Pakistan, sporting or otherwise. It is the incantation we chant when we are inviting good fortune, and the prayer we use to give shape to this imagined fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look for it every time we’re stuck in a quagmire mid-tournament (which is by and large a yearly occurrence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2015 invocation was no different. The words &lt;em&gt;josh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;junoon&lt;/em&gt; were used, as they always are, those abstract ideals of hope and zeal and valour that never fully lend themselves in translations to other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what was perhaps most intriguing about this remake was the fact that a sad follow-up was shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Pakistan was knocked out by Australia (because, of course), the TV and video advertisements that brandished all colours of waving flags a day before were replaced by clips of an imagined aftermath: hung faces in front of projector screens, the green stars and crescents painted on them going flaccid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empty rooftops with stray, limp pieces of confetti sadly billowing in the breeze. A sadder version of the song, essentially saying “we lost, but it’s okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the reprise that particularly tickled my fancy, but the idea that a company producing a hype song for one of the decade’s most anticipated cricketing events had the foresight to produce a version for the sadder, but probably likelier outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like it came as a shock — the campaign included the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1163765&quot;&gt;routine defeat&lt;/a&gt; to India, the fabled 1-4 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1171788/world-cup-campaign-pakistan-merely-lived-up-to-its-billing#:~:text=A%20150%2Drun%20loss%20to%20an%20equally%20unpredictable%20West%20Indies%20side&quot;&gt;collapse &lt;/a&gt;against the West Indies that the country woke up before dawn to witness, and of course, an immediately historicised dropped catch in the quarter final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that Pakistan losing or ungracefully bowing out of a tournament isn’t necessarily an unfamiliar feeling. It is often anticipated, often met with a begrudging acknowledgement: “&lt;em&gt;haan yaar, pata tha yehi hoga.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, I was thirteen years old during that particular World Cup, and while I do remember all the horrors in technicolour, I cannot help but remember the few gleaming specks of joy that somehow muscled their way out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a then 27-year-old Sarfaraz Ahmed playing perhaps the first iconic knock of his career against South Africa, falling short of a half-century by one run, and Pakistan winning a game that it probably shouldn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan player Sarfraz Ahmed celebrates in a match during the 2015 ICC World Cup. &amp;mdash; Reuters/File&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/062018444e10ab9.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan player Sarfraz Ahmed celebrates in a match during the 2015 ICC World Cup. — Reuters/File&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the world, as Wahab Riaz was bowling ball after ball of the spell of his life to Shane Watson, I remember loitering around my school’s staffroom during the quarter final, asking the one teacher who would indulge my classmates and me by giving us an update on the score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each of these trips, we would trundle back to class and take a moment to collectively (mournfully) pray at our desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember realising properly for the first time in my life that all the stretched out, worn out, drawn out cliches about coming back to this team over and over again would be true for my whole life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket feels different now than it did back then — it’s faster and more saturated, with so many more places and people and things involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some form of a “World Cup” every year, and it feels difficult to truly feel what a looming World Cup feels like when one is around the corner every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more recently, the constant uncertainty around cricket has been cause for further disillusionment — a Champions Trophy which was supposed to happen entirely at home &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734&quot;&gt;not having been so&lt;/a&gt;, disappointing showings in 2023 and 2024, and an Asia Cup truncated with political puppet shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into the T20 World Cup, Pakistan is once again at the centre of what looks like a less-than-ideal unfolding: Pakistan has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycotted &lt;/a&gt;the match against India in solidarity with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;against ICC’s inconsistent treatment across teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha addresses a press conference ahead of the ICC Men&amp;rsquo;s T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands, at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 6. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/06202528298086f.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha addresses a press conference ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands, at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 6. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the hybrid-model compromise with India in 2024, which promised neutral venues for both teams in the case of an ICC tournament in either one, Pakistan will be playing its group matches in Colombo, with Sri Lanka being cohosts for the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we have a long history with our good friend Colombo in the rain, and with a fluctuating percentage of rain in the forecast, the possibility of any of Pakistan’s games being washed out is not zero. There is no margin for error. The realistic thing would be to not hope too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, one can’t help but feel like that after a while; the Pakistan side showing up to this World Cup feels like a team again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman Ali Agha’s success at number 3 has unlocked a vein of potential for Pakistan — while his T20 strike rate is around 122, at this position, he has averaged 37 and struck at a solid 168, especially in the recent series against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966516&quot;&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970108&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batting aside, Agha has amassed T20 series wins against South Africa, Australia, West Indies and Bangladesh, in addition to two tri-series wins and leading Pakistan to be the finalists in the Asia Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we speak, Saim Ayub is the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971031&quot;&gt;number one&lt;/a&gt; all-rounder in T20 cricket, and Usman Tariq, with his perfectly legal action, has provided Pakistan’s bowling line-up with a contested but undeniable innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971011/spin-heavy-pakistan-hit-form-but-india-boycott-risks-early-t20-world-cup-exit&quot;&gt;spin arsenal&lt;/a&gt; of Saim, Abrar Ahmed, Usman Tariq, Shadab Khan and Muhammad Nawaz has shaped up to be one of the most promising in the tournament, if the statement 3-0 win against Australia was any indication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s Abrar Ahmed bowls during the second T20 international cricket match between Pakistan and Australia at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on January 31. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/06201901ab69749.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All histories up till now have shown that Pakistan’s form before a tournament is just about as untrustworthy as Pakistan’s performances during one — but against all my wisdom, I am compelled to hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, cricket is currently at the mercy of administrative mishaps and Pakistan fans are at the mercy of the Pakistan cricket team. But sometimes it is good to remember that not even the most illustrious of wisdoms and an undeniable breadth of knowledge does not absolve us of this reality: when Pakistan plays cricket, we will be tuning in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this time, the sadder songs will remain in the archives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Captain Salman Agha defends ‘X factor’ Usman Tariq’s bowling action ahead of T20 World Cup opener</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971423/captain-salman-agha-defends-x-factor-usman-tariqs-bowling-action-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-opener</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Agha defended off-spinner Usman Tariq’s unorthodox bowling action on Friday and called him the side’s “X factor” on the eve of their Twenty20 World Cup opener against the Netherlands in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariq, who has played three T20 Internationals since his debut against South Africa in November, has been reported twice for a suspect bowling action in the Pakistan Super League. His bowling style culminates in him pausing near the crease before firing the ball in with a side-arm sling-shot action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 28-year-old claimed two wickets in his second T20 International, against Australia, and Australia batsman Cameron Green — one of his two victims in that match in Lahore — made a chucking gesture after being dismissed as he made his way off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t understand why we are talking about his action because in my opinion it is a fair action,” Salman told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He has been tested twice and he has been cleared,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think there is no problem in his action. Yes, he is the X factor of the team, and where we feel that we need an X factor, we will definitely use him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having decided to boycott their Group A contest against defending champions India after Bangladesh were excluded from the tournament, Pakistan will have little margin for error in their bid to qualify for the Super 8 stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from India, the group also contains the United States, who stunned Pakistan via the Super Over in the 2024 edition of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman said they would have to be at their best even against second-tier teams like Namibia or the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is very important because you haven’t played much against these sides and you don’t really know their strength and weaknesses,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So it is very, very important to bring your A game, and we as a team only think about how we can execute our plans for 40 overs.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Crisis of neutrality at ICC</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971358/crisis-of-neutrality-at-icc</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;UNLESS you’ve been perpetually asleep since 1947, Pakistan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to play an upcoming T20 World Cup group match against India would come as no surprise. Cricket between India and Pakistan has often been seen as a proxy war, and it used to be that this ‘war’ was played out on the field, with the competition between bat and ball determining victory and defeat. That was then. In recent times, even the selection of venues and itineraries has been weaponised. This is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could make a convincing case that India started it, and Pakistan has finally had no option but to respond with tit for tat. India’s cricketers haven’t played in Pakistan since 2008, when the Asia Cup was held in Karachi. Over this period, Pakistan has nevertheless played at Indian venues no less than 19 times, the last in November 2023 as part of the ODI World Cup. Initially, India’s refusal could be justified as a matter of safety and security. After all, even Pakistan’s own team was forced to play in the UAE for several years after the Lahore terrorism of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet once Pakistan’s security situation improved and other top-tier teams such as Australia, South Africa, England and New Zealand returned to play at Pakistani venues, India’s cricket board had to fetch another excuse. It came up with the notion of “government permission”, effectively ceding decision-making to the hardline BJP, India’s current ruling party. The mask was finally off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this Indian intransigence, Pakistan’s hosting of last year’s Champions Trophy was reduced to a farce. While the rest of the eight-team tournament proceeded happily in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi, India was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1894430&quot;&gt;allowed&lt;/a&gt; to play all five of its matches in Dubai, including a high-voltage group match versus Pakistan on Feb 23 as well as the tournament final on March 9. What explains this extreme asymmetry is India’s clout as a cricketing superpower. With its massive billion-plus audience, India has dominated world cricket through revenues, sponsorships, lobbying and, ultimately, commandeering of the International Cricket Council (ICC), the global body of cricket governance. The situation had become very frustrating for Pakistan to the point that it seemed we had no agency in the matter, no cards left to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two recent dramatic political developments, however, have reset this calculus. One was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;overthrow&lt;/a&gt; of Indian-backed Sheikh Hasina Wajid in Bangladesh, which has ignited a storm of Bangladeshi fury towards its meddling western neighbour. The other was the backfiring adventurism of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988&quot;&gt;Operation Sindoor&lt;/a&gt;, which has infused Pakistani administrators with a newfound confidence in their posture towards India. The ripples of these two convulsions have now converged in the cricketing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pure cricketing terms, forfeiting a group match seems a needless own-goal. But a point had to be made, and the PCB did it cleverly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First came Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967562&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to the ICC to have their upcoming World Cup matches shifted outside India to Sri Lanka, a concession that Pakistan had already extracted. Ostensibly triggered by the unexplained expulsion of a Bangladeshi player from an Indian Premier League franchise, Bangladesh’s reluctance to play in India actually reflects worsening political ties. Emboldened by Bangladesh, Pakistan too dug in its heels, announcing ongoing internal deliberations, with a final call on World Cup participation to be made by the Pakistani government on Feb 1. That decision was made public in a tweet: Pakistan would play the World Cup but boycott the group match versus India. The possibility of facing India at a later stage of the tournament was left unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pure cricketing terms, forfeiting a group match seems a needless own-goal by the Pakistan Cricket Board, because you are throwing away two valuable points and jeopardising qualification to the next stage. But a point had to be made, and the PCB did it cleverly. Pakistan has a terrible record against India in ICC tournaments, and it is highly likely we would have lost this match anyway. Fortunately, our other three opponents in the group stage are all associate-level teams which, although potentially a banana peel, is no mountain to climb either. Meanwhile, we have deprived the Indian public of its favourite spectacle — thrashing Pakistan at cricket. Simply put, these matches have become television gold for India. The India-Pakistan match in the 2023 ODI World Cup attracted a collective (terrestrial and digital) viewership of over 400 million, and the viewership of last year’s Champions Trophy India-Pakistan match exceeded 800m. The now-defunct encounter of Feb 15 would surely have garnered similar numbers. Should India and Pakistan clash later at the knockout stage, you can be assured all viewership records will be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selective boycott has triggered polite chatter in Pakistani circles while unleashing uproar in India. That tells you how effective it’s been. Indian hardliners are livid and the Indian public is crushed with disappointment. At the same time, some sensible Indian voices have also emerged. Shashi Tharoor, the erudite Indian politician and scholar, has urged India to reach out to Pakistan and Bangladesh under ICC’s umbrella and “call off this nonsense”. Sharda Ugra, a respected Indian cricket journalist, has laid the blame squarely on India’s cricket board, accusing it of petty egoism and institutional failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;tragedy&lt;/a&gt; in this clutter, apart from cricket itself, is Bangladesh, who have every reason to feel hard done by. The could easily have played their matches in Sri Lanka, following Pakistan’s precedent; yet the ICC threatened them with replacement, and that threat was eventually carried out. This leaves the ICC with a lot to answer for. As an organisation tasked with the welfare of global cricket, it should be a neutral body; instead, it has been reduced to a mouthpiece for India. All cricketing nations need to join forces, take principled stands, and hold the ICC accountable. The costs of doing nothing are simply too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The writer, a professor of neurology at Aga Khan University, has written on cricket for international publications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>India’s stranglehold on cricket questioned after Pakistan’s show of solidarity with BD</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971308/indias-stranglehold-on-cricket-questioned-after-pakistans-show-of-solidarity-with-bd</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;INDIA’S dominance over world cricket has been evident for nearly two decades, underpinned by its vast population and the commercial power of its domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of the Indian Premier League in 2008 only entrenched that advantage, enabling the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to amass unprecedented financial influence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That influence has seldom been questioned, even when it appeared to undermine competitive balance. The elephant in the room — that international cricket increasingly operates on terms set by India — is no longer being ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; its T20 World Cup group match against India has drawn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970619/principles-before-commercial-interests-cricketers-politicians-react-to-pakistan-boycotting-india-match-in-t20-world-cup&quot;&gt;rare public backing&lt;/a&gt; from senior voices in cricket commentary, who have questioned the International Cricket Council’s consistency and the growing influence of commercial and political considerations on the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUSSAIN, ATHERTON FLAG INCONSISTENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former England captain Nasser Hussain, speaking on the Sky Cricket Podcast alongside Michael Atherton, said Pakistan and Bangladesh were justified in pushing back against what he described as selective enforcement of ICC rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At some stage someone has got to say enough is enough — can we just get back to playing cricket?” Hussain said, arguing that the central issue was consistency rather than politics. He questioned whether the ICC would have adopted a similarly rigid stance had India been unable to travel due to government directives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hussain praised Bangladesh for defending its position after being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;dropped from the tournament&lt;/a&gt; when the ICC declined to relocate its matches from India to Sri Lanka, and described Pakistan’s boycott of the India fixture as a necessary stand against a system increasingly shaped by financial and political power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atherton echoed those concerns, pointing to previous instances in which India was allowed to play at neutral venues after refusing to tour Pakistan. Denying Bangladesh similar flexibility, he warned, risked undermining the credibility of international cricket’s governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If allowances have been made before, you can’t suddenly decide not to make them now,” Atherton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former England batter Mark Butcher went further, calling Pakistan’s selective boycott a “masterstroke” that exposed the tournament’s financial fragility. By targeting only the India match — the most commercially valuable fixture in world cricket — Butcher said Pakistan had highlighted the extent to which broadcasters, the ICC and co-host India depended on a single contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole thing rests on that game,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHEHBAZ DEFENDS DECISION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was against this backdrop that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971047&quot;&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt; the decision, saying Pakistan would not play the match against India while continuing to participate in the rest of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing a federal cabinet meeting on Wednesday, he said Pakistan stood with Bangladesh and that while sport should remain free of politics, principles of fairness could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bangladesh, the move was welcomed. Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan thanked Pakistan for its support, calling it a principled stand against preferential treatment and double standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi also weighed in, urging the ICC to ensure equal treatment of all member boards and arguing that cricket should serve as a bridge when politics divides nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all former players, however, supported the boycott. Former Australia fast bowler Brett Lee said he hoped the match would still go ahead, calling for politics to be kept out of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s get the politics out of it,” Lee said on the Mr Cricket UAE podcast. “I really hope the match happens. The whole world watches when India and Pakistan play one another.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision, however, does not come without risk. The ICC has warned of potential long-term consequences for Pakistan cricket, including sanctions, withheld revenue distributions and compensation claims from broadcasters. Some observers question whether the gesture, however principled, adequately accounts for the financial asymmetries that already favour India.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pemra remains ‘headless’ as new chief awaits  PM Office nod</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971340/pemra-remains-headless-as-new-chief-awaits-pm-office-nod</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Even though the country’s electronic media regulator has been without a chairperson since October, a summary for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964833&quot;&gt;appointment&lt;/a&gt; of Ambreen Jan as head of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) has been pending with the Prime Minister’s Office for over a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Jan, a former federal secretary for information, was selected by the parliamentary panel as Pemra chairperson. If her appointment is approved, she will be the first woman to head the authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a reliable source, Ambreen Jan’s confirmation has been held up due to “objections regarding security clearance”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Jan is a former Grade-22 officer and has served as information secretary, the director general of Radio Pakistan and as managing director of PTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also served as press counsellor in Bangladesh from 2011 to 2018, when Islamabad-Dhaka ties were under strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was among the five shortlisted candidates considered for the Pemra job, along with retired Brigadier Anwar Ahmed, journalist Mateen Haider, Irfan Ashraf and Dr Hamid Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final shortlist narrowed the choice to three candidates, omitting the names of Irfan Ashraf and Hamid Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under an amendment made to&lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://pemra.gov.pk/assets/uploads/legal/Ordinance_2002.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Pemra Act,&lt;/a&gt; a parliamentary committee consisting of four members — two each from the National Assembly and the Senate — will recommend a candidate for appointment as head of the regulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury benches and the opposition will have one member each from the National Assembly and the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parliamentary committee finalised and recommended the candidate for appointment by the President over a month ago, but the file is awaiting onward transmission to the Presidency from the Prime Minister’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saleem Baig, the previous Pemra chairman, was also an officer of the Information Group. He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1410839&quot;&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 and reappointed in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Baig retired in September last year after becoming the longest serving head of the Authority. His predecessor, Absar Alam, was removed from the post by the Lahore High Court in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulator’s mandate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pemra was established under the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw2-apaUY2Fqa-apaUY2FrbZ8=-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj-con-9741&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pemra Ordinance 2002&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate and regulate the private electronic media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has mandate to improve the standards of information, education and entertainment and to facilitate dissemination of information related to current affairs, religious matters, art, culture as well as science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key segments regulated by Pemra include Direct to Home (DTH) broadcasting, satellite television, landing rights permission (LRP), FM Radio and Cable TV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Pakistan will seek advice from their government if they reach the knockout phase of the T20 World Cup and meet arch-rivals India, captain Salman Agha said on Thursday. The tournament has been marred by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh were kicked out and Pakistan refused to face co-hosts India in their Group A match. [&amp;#8230;]</description>

      <description>In the 18 months since the collapse of Sheikh Hasina&apos;s government, Bangladesh has endured political turmoil but also biting economic pain -- with many hoping for a rebound under new leadership after elections on February 12. FRANCE 24&apos;s Mark Owen speaks with Asif Bin Ali, Geopolitical Analyst and Doctoral Fellow at Georgia State University, who says that the electorate is mainly motivated by the desire for stability and the need for reform.</description>

      <title>T20 World Cup: Sri Lanka urges Pakistan to reconsider boycotting India match</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254/t20-world-cup-sri-lanka-urges-pakistan-to-reconsider-boycotting-india-match</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board on Thursday asked Pakistan to reconsider its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970619&quot;&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; to boycott their first-round encounter with arch-rival India in the T20 World Cup co-hosted by the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan decided &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;not to play&lt;/a&gt; India on February 15 in Colombo to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who were excluded from the tournament after refusing to play their matches in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade and meet only at global or regional tournament events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any non-participation will have wide-ranging implications, including substantial financial exposure for SLC and the potential loss of anticipated tourism inflows,” the board said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It recalled that Sri Lanka had toured Pakistan to express solidarity and revive international matches there when other nations stayed away due to security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We urge you to take into account the exceptional circumstances, the enduring relationship between our two boards, and the broader interests of the game of cricket,” SLC said, calling on Pakistan to play their scheduled match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India start the T20 World Cup on home soil against the US on Saturday. Pakistan play their first match of the tournament, also on Saturday, in Colombo against the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Pakistan’s boycott of their scheduled match against India on February 15 in Colombo, the arch-rivals may be forced to play each other if they reach the knockout stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;consult &lt;/a&gt;the government, skipper Salman Agha said earlier on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan team will seek govt nod if it meets India in T20 World Cup knockout phase: captain Salman Agha</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240/pakistan-team-will-seek-govt-nod-if-it-meets-india-in-t20-world-cup-knockout-phase-captain-salman-agha</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will seek advice from their government if they reach the knockout phase of the T20 World Cup and meet arch-rivals India, captain Salman Agha said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament has been marred by an acrimonious political buildup after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;kicked out&lt;/a&gt; and Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to face co-hosts India in their Group A match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a semi-final or final showdown between the uneasy South Asian neighbours is still a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The India game is not in our control. It was the government’s decision and if we have to play them in the semi-final or the final, we will go back to them and act on their advice,” Agha told reporters in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India, citing security concerns, as relations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962623&quot;&gt;soured&lt;/a&gt; and were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;kicked out&lt;/a&gt; of Group C by the International Cricket Council (ICC), to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan backed Bangladesh’s plea to have their games moved to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government in Islamabad cleared the national team to take part but ordered them not to play in the marquee group match against India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s sad Bangladesh are not here. They have a very good side. Hopefully, they will support us,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in multinational events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will face Namibia, the Netherlands and the United States in the group stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re excited to play in this tournament. We lost to USA in the last World Cup and we are determined to put that disappointment behind us and put a few things right,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will not only lose two points for forfeiting their India match but will also take a big hit to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even losing one of their group games to bad weather could make it difficult for Pakistan to qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know the margin for error is small, but we can’t control the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are here to play good cricket and we’re not bothered about the conditions,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, the 2009 champions, arrive after a 3-0 whitewash of Australia at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been playing really good cricket. We haven’t lost a series since the Asia Cup last year. Everything is coming along nicely and we’re confident of doing well,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Pakistan’s games will be played in Sri Lanka, where they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966516&quot;&gt;toured in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very happy to play in Sri Lanka — it’s a second home for me. This is my sixth visit, we know the conditions and we get a lot of support,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav has said that his team would show up in Colombo for their T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan, despite Pakistan boycotting the match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t said no to playing them (Pakistan),” Yadav told reporters at Mumbai’s Wankhede stadium, where India will begin their campaign against the United States on Saturday’s opening day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are the ones who have said no. Our flights are booked, and we are going to Colombo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India need to be at the stadium and ready to take the field for the February 15 match in order to make sure of being awarded the two points for a match forfeit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way we have been playing, it looks like we are the favourites,” he smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that seemed like an overconfident statement, the India captain was quick to caution: “There are 19 (other) good teams in the tournament, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On a given day, when you play, you have to bring your A-game and play good cricket.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yadav said no team would be taken lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sure every game will be very important,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>UN human rights agency in ‘survival mode’: chief</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971244/un-human-rights-agency-in-survival-mode-chief</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The United Nations human rights chief said on Thursday that his agency was “in survival mode” due to funding shortfalls, as he launched a $400 million appeal to tackle global rights crises in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volker Turk warned countries that at a time when global human rights are under significant assault, his office was facing dire funding shortages hampering its increasingly important and life-saving work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our reporting provides credible information on atrocities and human rights trends at a time when truth is being eroded by disinformation and censorship,” he told diplomats at the UN rights office headquarters in Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a lifeline for the abused, a megaphone for the silenced, and a steadfast ally to those who risk everything to defend the rights of others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the UN Human Rights Office’s regular budget — set by the UN General Assembly of member states — was $246m, but it ultimately received only $191.5m of that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also sought $500m in voluntary contributions, of which $257.8m came in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding for the UN’s human rights work has long been chronically underfunded, but Turk said, “We are currently in survival mode, delivering under strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These cuts and reductions untie perpetrators’ hands everywhere, leaving them to do whatever they please. With crises mounting, we cannot afford a human rights system in crisis,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN human rights office lost around 300 out of 2,000 staff last year and had to end or scale back its work in 17 countries. Its programme in Myanmar, for example, was cut by 60 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#high-impact-low-cost&quot; id=&quot;high-impact-low-cost&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;High impact, low cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the UN General Assembly approved a regular budget of $224.3m for human rights. However, with the United Nations facing a liquidity crisis, uncertainty remains over how much Turk’s office will receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is among a slew of international organisations hit by a global funding crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States was the UN’ biggest contributor but has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1895673&quot;&gt;slashed &lt;/a&gt;its funding since President Donald Trump returned to power in January 2025 — while other countries have tightened their belts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UN chief Antonio Guterres &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970287&quot;&gt;warned &lt;/a&gt;last Friday that the world body is on the brink of financial collapse and could run out of cash by July, as he urged countries to pay their dues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Turk is seeking $400m in voluntary funding from countries and donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said human rights accounted for a very small slice of overall UN spending but produced “high-impact” results that help to stabilise communities, build trust in institutions and underpin lasting peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The cost of our work is low; the human cost of underinvestment is immeasurable,” he insisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, UN human rights staff working in 87 countries undertook more than 5,000 human rights monitoring missions — down from 11,000 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That means less evidence for both protection and prevention,” said Turk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#countering-secrecy&quot; id=&quot;countering-secrecy&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Countering secrecy’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving examples of his office’s work, Turk said it supported 67,000 survivors of torture and modern slavery, documented tens of thousands of human rights violations and exposed discrimination in more than 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its monitoring mission in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970922&quot;&gt;Ukraine &lt;/a&gt;is the “only organisation” with a comprehensive record of verified civilian casualties “since the initial Russian invasion in 2014”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bangladesh, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1854057&quot;&gt;fact-finding mission&lt;/a&gt; on the 2024 crackdown “helped establish a comprehensive record of systematic and serious human rights abuses”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the probe in the Democratic Republic of Congo “uncovered patterns of grave human rights violations that may amount to crimes against humanity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All this work aims to bring the stories of victims to the world, countering secrecy — the oppressor’s strongest ally — and challenging injustice and impunity,” Turk said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lahore Qalandars directly sign Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rehman for over Rs60m</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Lahore Qalandars announced on Thursday that it had directly signed Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman for PSL’s 11th edition, spending over Rs60 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our Bangladeshi brother, Mustafizur, picked in 2016 and 2018, is now our direct signing and finally back with the family. Once a Qalandar, always a Qalandar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Amount spent on DS: PKR6.44 crore,” the announcement on Lahore Qalandar’s X account said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lahoreqalandars/status/2019313875754332331&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965494&quot;&gt;registered&lt;/a&gt; for the PSL in early January, following his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the Indian Premier League (IPL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old left-arm pacer, known for his variations and death-over bowling, was acquired by KKR for INR 9.20 crore in the IPL mini-auction held in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was the only Bangladesh player signed for the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR announced his release after receiving instructions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision came amid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962623&quot;&gt;strained relations&lt;/a&gt; between India and Bangla­desh, linked to reports of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965259&quot;&gt;banned IPL broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; in the country and the Bangladesh Cricket Board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;requested&lt;/a&gt; the International Cricket Council (ICC) to shift its T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; the request, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replacing&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh with Scotland in the 20-team tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has played in multiple IPL seasons since 2016 and taken over 60 wickets in the league, previously also featured in the PSL for Lahore Qalandars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur’s direct signing has been made possible after the PCB &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967880&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; sweeping changes to the player acquisition mechanism for PSL 11 last month, replacing the long-running draft with a full-fledged auction and raising the player purse to $1.6m per franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new framework, each franchise is allowed one direct signing of a foreign player who did not feature in the previous season, giving teams an additional avenue to bolster their squads with new international talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSL 11 will begin on March 26, and will also mark the return of Faisalabad as a host city, expanding the league’s footprint beyond the existing venues of Karachi, Lahore, Multan and Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nipah virus no immediate threat to citizens: AKUH experts</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971067/nipah-virus-no-immediate-threat-to-citizens-akuh-experts</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;KARACHI: While rejecting fears concerning the possible&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969658&quot;&gt; spread&lt;/a&gt; of Nipah virus in Pakistan, experts at a roundtable conference held on Wednesday underscored the need for building healthcare readiness and prioritising implementation of infection control protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were speaking at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) at a briefing organised to create awareness about epidemiological risks, transmission pathways and prevention strategies related to Nipah virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the experts, the zoonotic virus, which is an infectious agent that jumps from animals to humans, causing disease, currently poses no direct threat to Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of late January, 2026, only two cases involving healthcare workers have been&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969509&quot;&gt; confirmed&lt;/a&gt; in West Bengal, India, and that the risk of international spread is currently categorised as low due to the geographical distance of the outbreak (eastern India, Bangladesh) and the virus’ limited human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress need to improve healthcare standards and adopt basic hygiene protocols&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The virus is found in animals but can also affect humans. However, only a handful of cases (of human-to-human transmission) have been reported in recent years globally,” said Dr Faisal Mahmood, Professor, infectious diseases and Associate Chief Medical Officer, AKUH, adding that no case has been reported in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experts explained that the primary mode of Nipah virus transmission is zoonotic, occurring through direct contact with infected bats or the consumption of food, such as raw tree sap or fruit, contaminated by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The virus is not spread through casual exposure to bats, such as flying nearby. It has a high fatality rate of 40 to 50 per cent but it doesn’t spread as easily as respiratory viruses such as Covid-19,” Dr Mahmood clarified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Nosheen Nasir, Associate Professor and Section Head of Infectious Diseases Department, AKUH, the two cases confirmed in West Bengal, India, were of nurses working at the same hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of them is recovering while another is reported to be on ventilator support. The authorities there have tested 190 contacts, all of them have tested negative,” she said, adding that no case had been reported from the western region of India that bordered Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to her, cases of Nipah virus infection were first reported in 1998 in Malaysia, where it affected pig farmers. Since then, cases have reported in Bangladesh, India, the Philippines and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About its clinical manifestation, she said the infection initially presented with flu like symptoms but rapidly progressed to severe brain inflammation, causing neurological problems including fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to a question about the Nipah cases affecting healthcare workers, the experts agreed that infection control practices were too weak in Pakistan and needed to be implemented strictly that would help address growing threat of all kinds of infectious diseases including HIV and hepatitis C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t need extra wards. We just need to be vigilant, improve our healthcare standards and adopt basic hygiene protocols,” Dr Mahmood said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to concerns over the strong regional presence of the virus and Pakistan’s compromised healthcare services, Dr Nosheen said: “The way the infection presents itself in humans, you can’t hide those cases. Having said that, we need to improve clinical surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel acknowledged the government’s proactive screening of travellers at international entry points as a positive step in safeguarding public health. Drawing on lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic nearly six years ago, AKUH experts emphasised that strong health resilience is built through early preparedness, effective coordination, and sustained community awareness, rather than reactive containment alone.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-subhead&quot;&gt;The two countries have stepped up ties since the removal of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from power in 2024&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-cutline&quot;&gt;A &apos;Boycott Bangladesh&apos; movement has gained momentum in India following the removal of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajid in 2024 (MEE)&lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.3800000000000001; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 13px;&quot;&gt;January 2025 marked a significant moment in South Asian diplomacy when Lieutenant General Asim Malik, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/pakistan&quot;&gt;Pakistan’s&lt;/a&gt; intelligence chief, visited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/bangladesh&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.3800000000000001; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 13px;&quot;&gt;It was the first such trip by the head of Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence, or ISI, since the country’s independence from Pakistan in 1971.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malik arrived in Dhaka via Dubai and was received by Lieutenant General Muhammad Faizur Rahman, the quartermaster general of the Bangladesh army.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit came months after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/05/asia/bangladesh-prime-minister-residence-stormed-intl&quot;&gt;political ousting&lt;/a&gt; of Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s longest-serving prime minister, who was unceremoniously removed by popular revolt in 2024.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The renewed engagement between Dhaka and Islamabad has drawn close scrutiny in New Delhi, where security officials and analysts see echoes of Pakistan’s evolving defence relationship with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/saudi-arabia&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, a partnership that has expanded over time from training and intelligence-sharing into deeper strategic coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian analysts warn that if Bangladesh were to follow a similar trajectory, it could complicate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/india&quot;&gt;India’s&lt;/a&gt; eastern security calculus and undermine New Delhi’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/explained-why-indias-neighbourhood-first-policy-is-about-to-face-its-greatest-test-in-2026-bangladesh-pakistan-and-nepal/articleshow/126232374.cms&quot;&gt;Neighborhood First&lt;/a&gt;” policy at a moment of regional flux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hasina, who governed Bangladesh for much of the past two decades, was widely viewed in New Delhi as a stabilising force in bilateral relations, particularly for her administration’s cooperation with India on counterterrorism and its refusal to allow Bangladeshi territory to be used for cross-border militancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Why Pakistan&apos;s war with India led to a boom in arms sales and defence ties&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/why-pakistans-war-india-led-boon-arms-sales-and-defence-ties&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her removal from power injected uncertainty into Dhaka’s foreign and security policy, intensifying concerns in India over possible shifts in Bangladesh’s regional alignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/pakistans-isi-chief-visits-dhaka-aims-to-create-intel-sharing-network-with-bangladesh/articleshow/117465352.cms?from=mdr&quot;&gt;The Economic Times&lt;/a&gt;, one of India’s leading newspapers, reported that the ISI chief’s visit was aimed at expanding intelligence cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh. “The Indian security officials see the renewed military engagement as gaining momentum after Hasina’s exit, raising concerns in New Delhi about potential implications for India’s internal security and its eastern borders,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robinder Nath Sachdev, an international relations expert and president of the Imagindia Institute, said India’s influence in Bangladesh has weakened amid a seeming shift away from nationalism. He attributes the shift to both an ideological switch and a reaction to Hasina’s former rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have seen a trend in Bangladesh in which identity has shifted from being Bangla first and Muslim second, to one that increasingly emphasises being Muslim first and Bangla second,” Sachdev told Middle East Eye.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Public opinion came to view Sheikh Hasina as acting in an autocratic manner because she was perceived to be supported by India. As a result, opposition to Hasina gradually turned into broader anti-India sentiment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sachdev says that there&apos;s also a growing perception in Bangladesh that the executions of members of Jamaat-e-Islami by the Hasina government were at the behest of India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Military ties and strategic coordination&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan–Bangladesh engagement has not been confined to just military ties. Civilian exchanges have also increased since 2024, signalling a reset in long-strained bilateral ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2025, Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, travelled to Dhaka, marking the first foreign ministerial visit from Pakistan in 13 years. Pakistan’s commerce minister, Jam Kamal Khan, also visited Bangladesh to advance trade talks and sign memoranda of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-advanced-talks-join-saudi-arabia-and-pakistan-defence-pact-report&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;alt&quot; class=&quot;mee-readmore-image&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Pakistan-Saudi-Arabia-leaders-AFP.jpg.webp?itok=YVd7WU5q&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Turkey in &apos;advanced talks&apos; to join Saudi Arabia and Pakistan defence pact: Report&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-advanced-talks-join-saudi-arabia-and-pakistan-defence-pact-report&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that year, the military exchanges intensified, too. In January 2025, Bangladesh sent a high-level military delegation to Pakistan led by Lieutenant General SM Kamrul Hassan, marking one of the most significant defence exchanges between the two countries in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, visited Dhaka in October 2025, meeting chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and senior military leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in December, reports emerged claiming that Bangladesh and Pakistan were exploring a mutual defence agreement, following the signing of a landmark Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, between Saudi Arabia and nuclear-armed Pakistan on 17 September 2025 in Riyadh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.news18.com/world/pakistan-bangladesh-move-toward-mutual-defence-agreement-amid-renewed-ties-exclusive-ws-kl-9784864.html&quot;&gt;CNN-News18,&lt;/a&gt; citing a senior source in Pakistan’s foreign ministry, reported that Islamabad and Dhaka had established a joint mechanism to finalise the scope and draft of the proposed agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this year, Pakistan is in advanced negotiations to sell Bangladesh its JF-17 fighter jet, with some reports suggesting as many as 48 units making up the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The initiative reflects growing military-to-military engagement and strategic coordination between the two South Asian nations,” the report said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;Opposition to Hasina gradually turned into broader anti-India sentiment&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Robinder Nath Sachdev,&amp;nbsp;Imagindia Institute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report added that Bangladesh’s military establishment was keen to pursue a strategic and defence pact with Pakistan, similar in scope to Pakistan’s defence cooperation arrangements with Saudi Arabia, and that multiple rounds of discussions had already taken place between senior military officials from both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/17/saudi-arabia-signs-mutual-defence-pact-with-nuclear-armed-pakistan&quot;&gt;Saudi-Pakistan agreement&lt;/a&gt;, both sides committed that any aggression against one would be treated as aggression against the other, formalising decades of military cooperation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant General Deependra Singh Hooda, a former general officer commanding-in-chief of the Indian army’s Northern Command, said any formal defence pact between Pakistan and Bangladesh would carry serious implications for the region if it were to materialise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, he expressed skepticism about the likelihood of such an agreement being finalised in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The interim government is unlikely to take such a step with elections approaching,” Hooda told Middle East Eye. “I also do not think all political parties in Bangladesh would support a mutual defence treaty of this nature, which would be seen as directed against India.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Limits of the relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India–Bangladesh relations, Hooda said, are currently strained, pointing to multiple sources of tension, including concerns in New Delhi over the alleged persecution of Hindu minorities in Bangladesh and a recent controversy involving India’s northeastern region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooda was referring to an incident during a visit to Bangladesh by Pakistani and Turkish representatives when caretaker Prime Minister Muhammad Yunus presented them with a map described by Bangladeshis as “Greater Bangladesh”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northeast-india-under-bangladesh-muhammad-yunus-gift-to-pakistan-general-stirs-row-101761553210333.html&quot;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; showed India’s seven northeastern states - collectively known as the Seven Sisters - within Bangladesh’s boundaries. The gesture triggered backlash in India, where officials and commentators described it as provocative and insensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To what extent can Pakistan actually come to Bangladesh’s assistance if there is any problem on the India–Bangladesh border?” Hooda said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need to look at pre-independence Bangladesh. One of the reasons the independence movement began in East Pakistan was the belief that West Pakistan was unable to provide security. The narrative at that time in West Pakistan was that the security of the East lay in the West,” he added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite improving ties, Hooda said, Bangladesh is unlikely to entrust Pakistan with its security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am not sure, looking at it practically, whether Bangladesh is willing to outsource its security to Pakistan in any way,” he said. “Yes, ties are growing. Relations between Bangladesh and Pakistan were in very bad shape and they are now trying to improve them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Pakistan nor Bangladesh has accepted or dismissed the reports regarding a potential defence agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEE contacted Bangladesh’s foreign affairs ministry in Dhaka for comment, but did not receive a response by the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noor Ahmad Baba, a political scientist and former professor at the University of Kashmir, downplayed the possibility of any such deal between Bangladesh and Pakistan. He said that such agreements require a high degree of trust and careful preparation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For a long time, the two countries did not enjoy a warm relationship. It is only after the removal of Sheikh Hasina&apos;s government that the two have begun expanding areas of cooperation,” Baba said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pakistans-arms-deals-position-it-squarely-within-growing-saudi-uae-rift&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;alt&quot; class=&quot;mee-readmore-image&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/000_36PB7UK.jpg.webp?itok=W72tC892&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Pakistan&apos;s arms deals position it squarely within growing Saudi-UAE rift&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pakistans-arms-deals-position-it-squarely-within-growing-saudi-uae-rift&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beyond this, however, the current interim government in Bangladesh cannot enter into major defence agreements that would carry serious long-term strategic implications for the region,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of the current cooling of India–Bangladesh relations, Baba added, Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan pose a challenge for Indian diplomacy, particularly at a time when New Delhi is already managing not-so-close relations with several of its neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh have only recently been revived. Signing an agreement similar to the one between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia would be difficult, as it requires a very high level of trust,” Baba said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I believe India will seek to revive its ties with Bangladesh, which is why we saw the Indian Foreign Minister, S Jaishankar, visit Dhaka following the death of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking after his visit to Bangladesh, Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar outlined New Delhi’s neighbourhood policy as one that combines cooperation with firmness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“India supports its neighbours through investment, development assistance and shared growth,” Jaishankar said, while warning that countries that tolerate terrorism “cannot expect the same approach”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referring specifically to Bangladesh, he said India’s economic growth benefits the wider region and expressed hope that bilateral ties would strengthen following Bangladesh’s elections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘There should be no politics in sports’: PM on decision to boycott match against India in T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971047/there-should-be-no-politics-in-sports-pm-on-decision-to-boycott-match-against-india-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott &lt;/a&gt;the match against India in the T20 World Cup, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said that there “should be no politics in sports”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the remarks while addressing the federal cabinet in Islamabad. The remarks were televised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have taken a clear stand regarding the T20 World Cup that we will not play the match against India,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There should be no politics in sports,” he said. “We have taken this stand after deliberating on it carefully,” he said, calling it an “appropriate decision”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube_short  media__item--relative&quot;&gt;    &lt;div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the government on Sunday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the upcoming T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held on Feb 15 in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development came after Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;withdrawal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the tournament amid tensions with India, which is one of the co-hosts of the T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of his address, PM Shehbaz began by talking about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970314&quot;&gt;attacks &lt;/a&gt;in Balochistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Within three to four days, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970967&quot;&gt;180 terrorists&lt;/a&gt; were sent to hell,” he said. “As a result, 17 personnel embraced martyrdom. Similarly, 31 civilians were martyred.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that a “heartbreaking incident” took place in Gwadar, where five women and children were martyred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These people (terrorists) are not human,” the premier said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM Shehbaz said that the nation would never forget the sacrifice of security forces and that since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566&quot;&gt;Marka-i-Haq&lt;/a&gt; — the name for Pakistan’s brief military conflict against India last year — Pakistan’s “hostile eastern neighbour” and other &lt;em&gt;khawarij&lt;/em&gt; were conspiring against the country’s progress and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Khawarij&lt;/em&gt; is a term used by the state to designate members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“God willing, this will not happen. We will completely eradicate terrorism and Pakistan will find success on the path of progress,” PM Shehbaz vowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the nation should remember how terrorists killed women, children and people who were trying to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a terrible incident and the whole nation is mourning, but it is standing with its law enforcement agencies and the Pakistan armed forces,” the premier added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The day will come when these sacrifices will be worthwhile and the scourge of terrorism will be erased from this country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching gears and discussing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970788/trump-warns-of-bad-things-if-no-deal-reached-with-iran&quot;&gt;tensions &lt;/a&gt;in Iran, PM Shehbaz emphasised that Pakistan has played a “brotherly role”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Myself, the deputy prime minister and the field marshal met the Iranian leadership on multiple occasions and we had telephone conversations,” he outlined. “We had several discussions and played our brotherly role as best we could.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier expressed the hope that through dialogue, a peaceful path would emerge leading to regional peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about Kashmir Day on February 5 (tomorrow), PM Shehbaz said that the nation, from Peshawar to Karachi, would express solidarity with freedom movements within the Indian-occupied territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The people will express their passionate devotion to Kashmir in different cities,” the premier said. “I personally will be heading to Azad Kashmir tomorrow and we will convey a message of solidarity on behalf of the whole nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM Shehbaz then spoke about his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970596/pm-shehbaz-meets-kp-cm-sohail-afridi-in-islamabad&quot;&gt;meeting &lt;/a&gt;with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I called him the day he was elected and assured him that he would have the full support of the Centre, regardless of whatever party he belongs to,” the premier recounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I told him that Pakistan comes before the party and that he is the chief minister of an important, beautiful province where the people are proud Pakistanis and brave. They have also sacrificed much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier noted that during the 2010 National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Rs800 billion was allocated to KP for counter-terrorism, security and policing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I told him that we gave this money under the NFC, but we have yet to see the results,” he said. “I said that the Safe City project remains incomplete, but he assured me that he intends to complete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I spoke to him &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970596&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;, and he mentioned that some payments have been delayed,” the premier added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I immediately tasked [Planning Minister] Ahsan Iqbal, the finance minister and the finance secretary to meet him (KP CM) and, wherever there are delays in payments, to resolve them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin-heavy Pakistan hit form, but India boycott risks early T20 exit</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971007/spin-heavy-pakistan-hit-form-but-india-boycott-risks-early-t20-exit</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s spin-heavy squad are in winning form ahead of the T20 World Cup, but a controversial decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;forfeit&lt;/a&gt; their marquee clash against India could still trigger another early exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan came close to withdrawing from the tournament in solidarity with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969933&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, who pulled out after refusing to play in India, citing security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan government eventually cleared the team’s participation but it barred them from facing India in Colombo in a blockbuster clash on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With two points for a win, a forfeit of the match will leave Pakistan with no margin for error if they are to progress as one of the top two from a five-team Group A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means they must win their opening game against the Netherlands in Colombo on Saturday and beat the United States three days later to stay in contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their final group game will be against Namibia on February 18.&lt;br /&gt;Captain Salman Agha said the move to boycott the India game was out of the team’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is not our decision. We have to follow what our government decides,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan government has not said what their stance might be if the team were to end up facing India again in the semi-finals or final. Agha was not thinking about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our job is to win, and we are capable of doing that,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;Pakistan will be keen to avoid a repeat of the last T20 World Cup in 2024, where a shock super over defeat to co-hosts the United States led to them failing to get out of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side has since faced criticism for failing to adapt to the modern demands of T20 cricket, with the batting, particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969370&quot;&gt;Babar Azam’s low strike rate&lt;/a&gt;, under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criticism was fuelled by Pakistan’s record last year, where 21 of their 34 T20 international wins came against lower-ranked opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#confidence-restored&quot; id=&quot;confidence-restored&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Confidence restored&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against elite teams, the results were sobering: three losses to India in the Asia Cup and a 4-1 series defeat to New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Agha believes recent performances have restored confidence.&lt;br /&gt;Pakistan beat South Africa 2-1, won a home tri-series, and then completed a 3-0 sweep of an under-strength Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had good preparation by beating Australia. We have the luxury of quality spinning all-rounders like Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan and Saim Ayub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re ticking most boxes and believe we can win the World Cup,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spin department has been strengthened by Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, the latter known for his unusual, slingy action and exaggerated pause at the crease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pace attack is led by the experienced Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faheem Ashraf provides seam-bowling all-round support and newcomer Salman Mirza has been impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batting remains Pakistan’s most volatile component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan provide strong starts, the side can post competitive totals, but collapses remain a constant threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head coach Mike Hesson has added another layer of risk by leaving out experienced wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan because of poor form, opting instead for makeshift options in Usman Khan, Khawaja Nafay and Farhan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, the ingredients for a deep run are present, but with points potentially forfeited, there is little room left for error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>That’s not cricket: How ‘creeping Hindutva’ stumped sportsmanship ahead of the T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970764/thats-not-cricket-how-creeping-hindutva-stumped-sportsmanship-ahead-of-the-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1993, a rising star kicked off a legendary Bollywood career with back-to-back megahits in &lt;em&gt;Darr&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Baazigar&lt;/em&gt;, where he introduced audiences to the concept of the ‘anti-hero’. Thirty-three years later, it led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;Bangladesh being expelled&lt;/a&gt; from a World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this paragraph makes no sense to you, there are some crucial details that need to be unpacked to make this connection clear. But at the heart of this story is one disturbing new reality — international cricket today has become a tool of India’s ruling Hindutva regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#from-mustafizurs-ouster-to-bangladeshs-expulsion&quot; id=&quot;from-mustafizurs-ouster-to-bangladeshs-expulsion&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From Mustafizur’s ouster to Bangladesh’s expulsion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin with the basic details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 2, a member of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Sangeet Som, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/bjp-leader-calls-shah-rukh-khan-traitor-after-kkr-gets-bangladeshi-player-mustafizur-rahman-for-ipl-10450934/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;attacked India’s most popular Muslim figure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Shahrukh Khan, calling him a traitor. Shahrukh owns the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), a cricket franchise of the Indian Premier League that had selected Bangladesh cricketer Mustafizur Rahman. Threatening Mustafizur with “dire consequences” and claiming Shahrukh had “no right to live” in India, Som’s calls led to a chorus of hatred against Shahrukh and Mustafizur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within days, the Indian cricket board, the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://sports.ndtv.com/ipl-2026/bcci-asks-kkr-to-release-mustafizur-rahman-amid-bangladesh-ipl-row-10232260&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BCCI “requested” KKR&lt;/a&gt; to release the player, vaguely citing “recent developments going on all across”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately, Bangladesh’s Sports Adviser &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.prothomalo.com/sports/cricket/k31o80g308&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Asif Nazrul reacted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ordering the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to ask the game’s governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), to change the venue of their matches in the upcoming T20 World Cup from India to co-host Sri Lanka. Nazrul &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that “if a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India … then the entire Bangladesh team cannot feel safe travelling to India for the World Cup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several rounds of negotiations between the BCB and the ICC, the latter responded firmly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235&quot;&gt;rejecting&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh’s request and stating that doing so “could set a precedent that would jeopardise the sanctity of future ICC events and undermine its neutrality as a global governing body”. The apex body kicked Bangladesh out of the tournament and replaced them with Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to that, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi vocally opposed the decision, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;decrying&lt;/a&gt; the ICC’s “double standards.” A few days later, the Government of Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;instructed&lt;/a&gt; its team to boycott its World Cup game against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#ocean-of-vagueness&quot; id=&quot;ocean-of-vagueness&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Ocean of vagueness’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how is all of this related to India’s ruling Hindutva regime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, Sangeet Som’s allegations and threats against Shahrukh and Mustafizur were part of the BJP’s standard dog-whistle, anti-Muslim tactics. These particular ones came as part of campaigning for the West Bengal state elections, where KKR play and where the BJP has called for the expulsion of local Muslims by claiming they are Bangladeshi refugees, amongst other bigoted claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has not been the first time that Shahrukh Khan in particular has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1166984&quot;&gt;come under the religiofascist BJP’s crosshairs&lt;/a&gt;. His decades-long megastardom has meant that the BJP has repeatedly sought to target him as the most iconic Muslim figure in Indian society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was unprecedented however was when the BCCI stepped in and ‘requested’ KKR to remove the player. Journalists in both India and Bangladesh noted that there were no indications of any internal discussion or debate within the BCCI before the decision was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a report in &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/call-on-bangladesh-seamer-mustafizur-rahmans-ipl-ouster-taken-at-top-level-in-bcci-10457349/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Indian Express&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the decision was taken at the highest level in the board, with neither board members nor the league’s governing council involved. An unnamed BCCI official told the paper that “we ourselves got to know about this through the media. There was no discussion. No suggestion was taken from our side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCCI’s request to KKR was also deliberately vague, avoiding any specifics of the toxic demands that led to the situation, which later allowed the ICC to reject BCB’s claims of security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to veteran Indian cricket journalist Sharda Ugra, this “ocean of vagueness” is a deliberate feature of the Indian board’s recent actions. She noted that despite her best efforts, she never managed to get any formal response on which officials ordered the Indian team to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942168&quot;&gt;refuse shaking hands&lt;/a&gt; with their Pakistani counterparts in the Asia Cup 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when the Indian team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1871165/pcb-chief-rules-out-hybrid-model-for-champions-trophy&quot;&gt;refused to travel to Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; for the Champions Trophy last year, Ugra said that “there [was] no specific instruction from anyone, no clear cut statement saying … that we have been instructed by the external affairs ministry or the home ministry or the foreign ministry or the prime minister’s office — nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same process seems to have been followed in Mustafizur’s case. As Ugra noted, “There is no evidence of any paperwork, [or] procedure … there’s no document that says … this guy cannot have a contract [or] he’s in danger. No official government warnings. It is just whisperings. That’s all that it seems to have come from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#the-question-of-revenue&quot; id=&quot;the-question-of-revenue&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The question of revenue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the BCCI is compromised by India’s ruling party, then the ICC is no different. It is currently run by Jay Shah, the son of Amit Shah, India’s Home Minister and the second-most important figure in the ruling regime after Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As such, its announcement expelling Bangladesh came to be seen as particularly hypocritical, given it had happily conceded to demands to move venues from India for the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/26/bangladesh-t20-world-cup-international-cricket-council-icc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;journalist Taha Hashim wrote in &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Guardian&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the ICC’s claim about protecting the “sanctity of future … events is a particularly tragicomic line [given that their] Champions Trophy decision did ‘set a precedent’, forming a hybrid model that has already turned ICC tournaments into a joke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi was the only dissenting voice from other cricket boards, terming the ICC’s actions regarding Bangladesh “double standards” and an “injustice” to the South Asian team, as well as promising action in solidarity. But while it does appear that the fallout with Bangladesh might give Naqvi and the PCB another ally, senior Bangladeshi cricket journalist Mohammad Isam is cautious about such a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting the political reality of Bangladesh being surrounded by India on three sides as well as the longstanding cultural links with Bangla-speakers across the border, he said that the options for Bangladeshi cricket were more limited. He pointed out that the current standoff was driven directly by the sports ministry and a government that is about to go into elections in February.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Isam, the expectation amongst observers after Mustafizur’s removal was a diplomatic approach from the board. “[We heard] that the BCB was planning to give a statement that was going to be middle of the ground … because while for this Bangladesh government [opposing] India can be something, but for the cricket board, Indian cricket is the end all. The BCB can’t really afford to fight the BCCI, as one tour from India pays the bills for several years.” Similarly, he mentioned that several voices within Bangladeshi cricket felt that the government’s response had put the ball in India’s court and restricted the BCB’s ability to negotiate a way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fear of lost revenue is the stick that allows India its undue sway over world cricket. While the PCB and Pakistan cricket have spent almost two decades adjusting to and living with a de facto ban from Indian cricket and its riches, none of the smaller boards have the resources or the clout for such a fight. Crucially, the most economically and politically powerful boards have also shown a complete sense of apathy on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sushant Singh, a lecturer at Yale University, wrote in a&lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cricketetal.com/p/mustafissure&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; blog post &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;that “the Mustafizur moment will not be the last time a player is sacrificed at the altar of majoritarian politics … The machinery is now in place, tested and proven effective. And no one — not the ICC, not the boards of other cricket nations, not the global media — has demonstrated the will to stop it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked over an email what would need to happen to resist this tide, he speculated that it “would happen when countries like England and Australia are targeted. That could lead to some kind of a pushback but even then, those boards may decide to lump the humiliation and keep placating the BCCI for the moolah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#indias-grip-on-international-cricket-finances-governance&quot; id=&quot;indias-grip-on-international-cricket-finances-governance&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;India’s grip on international cricket finances, governance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharda Ugra was similarly unmoved by the potential of any opposition from within the ICC or the two most powerful boards after India. “I’ve been following cricket for 30 years,” she said, adding that “I’ve never seen [the ICC] look this bad — they are an unserious organisation. [And] the Australian and English cricket boards are no more than the sidekicks of the big don in our game. There is no capable, mature leadership in the ICC anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That much maligned ICC leadership appeared to be scrambling in the wake of Pakistan’s decision to solely boycott the game against India — the biggest revenue generator in every tournament. In a statement released before they had even formally been notified of the decision by the PCB itself, the ICC made clear that “it expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution”, a much more conciliatory tone than the outright rejection of the BCB’s demands. Clearly, with a huge financial bite to face, the ICC’s priorities have been put to test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions by Bangladesh and Pakistan have been the first time in a long time that the sport has had to address someone else’s concerns other than India’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s vice-like grip over both international cricket’s finances as well as its governance has meant that the entire sport has become increasingly beholden to it. And in turn, the Hindutva movement and the BJP’s control over Indian institutions has meant that as Ugra puts it, the BCCI’s actions are now “addressing voting constituencies rather than cricket fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has meant that the fallout from campaigning in a local state election in India can lead to massive implications for foreign countries and players, potentially crippling the future of the sport. As one Indian observer &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/arseinho/status/2017981645564100785&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;posted on social media platform X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “this is what happens if you decide to torch your … one genuine soft power currency to please a few. You can draw a straight line from the Mustafizur decision to [the Pakistan government’s] decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any quick solution. &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cricketetal.com/p/armageddon-time&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Writing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after the news of Pakistan’s boycott, Sushant Singh said, “[The sport’s] final wicket will fall not to a rival bowler, but to a lawsuit from a broadcaster or the collapse of a commercial deal, leaving the game bankrupt in every sense — financially, morally, and culturally… The only way back is … through accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till then, the reality of the sport is that the flap of a butterfly’s wings in local Indian politics can cause a typhoon in another country’s cricketing fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JPMorgan plans frontier bond index</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970953/jpmorgan-plans-frontier-bond-index</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Pakistan among top-weighted countries in planned benchmark&lt;br /&gt;• Proposed gauge targets high-yield local bonds in 20-25 economies across Asia, Africa and beyond&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON: JPMorgan is finalising plans for a new index to track frontier market local currency bonds, investors consulted on the details told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, as the bank looks to satisfy a growing appetite for riskier and more diversified high-yield debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move, which comes 15 years after the Wall Street bank launched its hard-currency Next Generation Markets Index (NEXGEM) frontier index, coincides with the year-long &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968175&quot;&gt;slump&lt;/a&gt; in the dollar and some extraordinary recent rallies in markets like Argentina, Ecuador and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment on the plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six leading money managers who spoke to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; on condition of anonymity said the bank’s engagements with them reached an advanced stage in the second half of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed index includes 20 to 25 countries, with Egypt, Vietnam, Kenya, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh having the largest “weightings”, three of the managers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bond sizes and caps on weighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to one source, there would be a limit that means no country has a weighting of more than 8 per cent. A second source said an earlier consultation document had a proposed 10pc limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also set to only include bonds of at least $250 million equivalent, although that has raised issues around Zambia, which many would like to see included but has traditionally only sold smaller individual bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We expect they (JPMorgan) will give us a formal structure for the index around June with the opportunity to make some final comments,” said one senior fund manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are then likely to formally launch the index next year, we think.” Another senior fund manager said the initial announcement might be as early as the end of March, which could also bring the formal launch date forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trillion dollar market FTSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell has already had an equivalent index since 2021. JPMorgan’s versions, however, are more prominent among emerging market money managers, who effectively use them to compile their funds and measure their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis by Neuberger Berman estimates tradable local-currency debt has trebled over the last decade to around $1 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also calculates that over the last eight years, frontier market local FX debt had outperformed JPMorgan’s mainstream emerging market local currency index by almost 2.5 percentage points, and also outstripped the EM dollar bond index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We see that as a confirmation that frontier market growth and general economic performance has been systematically underpriced,” Neuberger Berman’s Rob Drijkoningen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Bank, frontier economies are home to a fifth of the world’s population but account for just 3.1pc of global capital flows and less than 5pc of global GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their populations, however, are expected to increase by another 800 million over the next 25 years more than the rest of the world combined — meaning they will play an increasingly important role in global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect JPMorgan’s new debt index to help expand local currency bond markets — something long-championed by the World Bank and IMF as a way to reduce the number of debt crises caused when currency crashes leave governments unable to pay hard-currency debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zambia and eligibility requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising interest in frontier market debt also comes as shaken confidence in once-safe debt in the developed world pushes capital flows to other parts of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the investors raised questions about Zambia, which until recently had only sold sub-$250 million local-currency bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not in some of JPMorgan’s early outlines, the investors said, but the country has since issued at least one larger bond, raising hopes it will now make the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One eligibility requirement that mirrors JPMorgan’s GBI-EM index of major emerging economies is that included bonds will have more than 2.5 years of remaining maturity — the time before full repayment is due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan estimated in September the index will have approximately 400 basis points or more of “pick-up” in yield over the GBI-EM, with over 60pc of the index constituents yielding more than 10pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potential promotion of top-weighted countries like Egypt and Nigeria to the GBI-EM index in coming years is another issue that could alter the index’s makeup, possibly putting off some investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will be important to nail that down,” one senior fund manager said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Aid, Ports, And The Limits of Incrementalism: What India’s Budget Says About Its Foreign Policy</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/aid-ports-and-limits-incrementalism-what-indias-budget-says-about-its-foreign-policy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yet the strategic costs are real. Reduced engagement in Bangladesh risks ceding influence at a moment when Dhaka is actively diversifying its partnerships. Hesitation over Chabahar weakens India’s leverage in Iran and Central Asia and underscores its vulnerability to US pressure even as it seeks a more multipolar foreign policy. The 2026–27 Budget does not signal a dramatic shift in Indian foreign policy. There is no abandonment of neighbours-first rhetoric or of connectivity-led diplomacy. What it reveals instead is a narrowing circle of feasible economic action.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s support was decisive in Bangladesh’s Liberation War in 1971. Bangladeshi freedom fighters lacked the military capability to overwhelm the Pakistani army and bring down the Dhaka government. Hence, India’s direct military intervention was instrumental in Bangladesh achieving independence. This intervention, however, was not purely humanitarian.

      <title>Pakistan’s ‘affordable’ China-developed jet: a victim of its own success?</title>

      <description>Pakistan says it has fielded requests for its JF-17 fighter jet from five countries in recent months – a surge of interest that could overwhelm its capacity to jointly produce the jet with China.
In the past month, Iraq, Bangladesh and Indonesia have expressed interest in acquiring the JF-17 Thunder, according to Pakistan’s Armed Forces.
Saudi Arabia and Libya were also exploring the aircraft, Reuters reported separately, after Pakistan hailed the performance of its Chinese-developed jets during...</description>

      <title>Earthquake of magnitude 4.1 strikes Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/earthquake-of-magnitude-4-1-strikes-bangladesh/articleshow/127876588.cms</link>
      <description>An earthquake measuring 4.1 magnitude shook Bangladesh on Tuesday. The tremor occurred at a depth of 150 kilometers. Bangladesh is situated in a seismically active region where three major tectonic plates converge. This geological setting makes the country highly prone to earthquakes.</description>

      <title>‘Back-channel talks underway after Pakistan decide to skip India T20 World Cup clash’</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697/back-channel-talks-underway-after-pakistan-decide-to-skip-india-t20-world-cup-clash</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: The government of Pakistan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday not to play its T20 World Cup group match against India, scheduled for Feb 15, has prom­pted the International Cricket Council (ICC) to initiate back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses, &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; has learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was announced around 15 days ahead of the scheduled fixture, giving the ICC sufficient time to explore possible options, including accommodating any reservations Pakistan may have, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to sources, a couple of other cricket boards have also stepped in to assist the ICC in its efforts to reach an amicable solution with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan announced its decision without citing a specific reason for boycotting the match against India. In the past, however, Australia and the West Indies forfeited their World Cup matches against Sri Lanka in 1996 on security grounds following instructions from their governments. England and New Zealand similarly forfeited matches against Zimbabwe and Kenya, respectively, during the 2003 World Cup on political grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some quarters have termed Pakistan’s move a mistake, noting that unlike previous instances involving other teams, no explicit justification was provided. Sources, however, said the PCB has factored this into its position and plans to rely on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1436402&quot;&gt;proceedings&lt;/a&gt; of the ICC’s Dispute Resolution Committee (DRC) in a case filed by Pakistan against India in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case stemmed from India’s failure to honour a memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the PCB and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2014, under which the two countries were to play six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In return, the PCB had supported the ICC’s ‘Big Three’ revenue-sharing model, under which India, Australia and England received a larger share of ICC revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the hearing, the PCB asked the BCCI to explain its refusal to tour Pakistan,” a sou­r­ce familiar with the 2018 proceedings said. “Initially, the BCCI stated that it was not obliged to provide a reason. Later, it claimed that the Indian government had not allowed the tour.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the PCB requested written instructions from the Indian government, the BCCI responded that such decisions were conveyed verbally and not documented, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, sources expressed concerns that, as in 2018, the BCCI influence within the ICC could again result in a ruling against Pakistan, potentially leading to financial penalties or sanctions. In such an event, the government of Pakistan may consider approaching an international court of arbitration, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is believed that Pakistan’s decision was influenced by a recent ICC ruling involving Bangladesh. The ICC had rejected Bangladesh’s request to shift its World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka on security grounds and instead excluded Bangladesh from the tournament, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replacing it with Scotland&lt;/a&gt;. The decision was passed by a 14-2 majority, with only Pakistan and Bangladesh voting against the move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The India-Pakistan fixture is considered the most lucrative match in world cricket and a cornerstone of the ICC’s revenue model. Media reports estimate its overall commercial value at around $500 million, factoring in broadcast rights, advertising premiums, sponsorships, ticket sales and ancillary commercial activity. Advertising slots during an India-Pakistan T20 typically fetch between Rs2.5 million and Rs4 million for 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following Pakistan’s announcement, the ICC issued a strongly worded statement, urging the PCB to “explore a mutually acceptable resolution which protects the interests of all stakeholders”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC notes the statement made by the government of Pakistan regarding the decision to instruct its national team to selectively participate in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026,” the statement said. “While the ICC awaits official communication from the PCB, selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ICC tournaments are built on sporting integrity, competitiveness, consistency and fairness, and selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competition,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While acknowledging the role of governments in matters of national policy, the ICC warned that the decision was “not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are reports that even if Pakistan maintains its stance, the Indian team will travel to Colombo for the scheduled match. If Pakistan do not field a team at the appointed time, India are expected to claim the points under tournament regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COMMENT: Why Pakistan must become a cricket superpower</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970748/comment-why-pakistan-must-become-a-cricket-superpower</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PAKISTAN’S &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; of its T20 World Cup match against India raises two fundamental questions: why the PCB took this decision, and what it hopes to achieve by it. The fact that neither answer is particularly clear invites a deeper concern, whether this dramatic gesture was fully thought through at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin with, let’s be clear on a few points. The ICC is controlled by India. It is a governing body that behaves like a wholly owned subsidiary of the BCCI. The ICC does not run international cricket, the BCCI — and therefore the Indian government — does. This is realpolitik. The rule of “might is right”. India is in charge, both as policymaker and paymaster, however you describe it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s malign dictatorship of international cricket is to be condemned, just as the previous dominance of England and Australia had been condemned. Today, India is the Pied Piper of cricket, playing a seductive tune that brings the rats of the world’s cricket boards under its control. Something does need to be done, namely ICC’s power and independence must be restored. But is this what Pakistan’s unilateral boycott will achieve?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has a political dispute with Pakistan, which it chooses to operationalise by “boycotting” bilateral series with Pakistan and refusing to set foot in the country. No other nation would be allowed to behave in this despotic manner. We’ve just seen what has happened to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;. Despotic rule is hypocritical. It is self-serving, and it is brutish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has the world of cricket in its pocket, while Pakistan has a big hole where its money and friends should be&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next tier of cricket nations, when it comes to financial might, England and Australia, are reliant on India for their revenues. They have sold their integrity and independence for Indian rupees. The remaining countries are too weak and irrelevant when it comes to tackling the excesses of India’s cricketing hegemony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same applies to the corporations and the broadcasters who invest in cricket. Without India’s billion-plus population, they don’t have a big enough market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the world of cricket commerce, India’s gravitational pull is too great. Fans might care about some of these hypocrisies and inequalities, but the global audience doesn’t care enough about whether Bangladesh is expelled or Pakistan boycotts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, of course, value in a Pakistan-India contest in a major tournament, otherwise why else would it be a manufactured feature of every single major competition. The match is a money spinner; it is good for India’s coffers. And given the fact that Pakistan seems unable to compete on these occasions, it is a perfect morale booster for the Indian nation, with profit built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, Pakistan’s boycott of the India match will hurt India a little. India will feel the pinch in its pocket, and so too will the other ICC members. But that pinch will only be a pinch. India will pocket the points instead and move closer to the next round of the tournament. Pakistan will lose valuable revenue and the points. Would Bangladesh have done the same for Pakistan? It hasn’t in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, considering the long history of India’s unfair sidelining of Pakistan, we know other nations have not and would not do the same for Pakistan. Pakistan is now a middle nation, at best, in the world of international cricket. It does not have financial muscle and it is not good enough on the field to pull other nations to its side. India has the world of cricket in its pocket, while Pakistan has a big hole in its pocket where its money and its friends should be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the language of Donald Trump, Pakistan has no cards. All this leaves Pakistan in a mess. It cannot genuinely hope to achieve anything meaningful as a result of its boycott. The deck is stacked against Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Principle, then, is all that Pakistan has left. But what is the principle here? If the principle is taking a stand in support of Bangladesh, then it is an empty gesture, admittedly a noisy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the principle is to protest India’s long history of mistreatment of Pakistan, the mistreatment will continue. If the principle is to protest India’s unconstitutional rule of international cricket, the cause is just but the means of protest amateurish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Pakistan really wants here is a shift in the balance of power in international cricket. It is entirely fair to think that must happen by freeing international cricket from India’s grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But to achieve this, Pakistan requires a long-term strategy with two primary objectives: to become commercially and politically powerful in international cricket, and to become a force again on the field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It might feel good to shout about a boycott, to savour a perceived blow to India’s giant ego, but this is no more than a captive shouting into a straitjacket, or an opiate for the masses. If Pakistan is serious about a reset in cricket’s international order, it must begin by working out how it can become a cricketing superpower again, a superpower that is financially strong and independent of India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do that and others might follow. Sadly, for the current leaders of Pakistan and its cricket, doing just that seems to be too much like hard thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/03/exiled-awami-league-members-political-comeback-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As Bangladesh prepares for the first election since Sheikh Hasina fled to India, Awami League figures living in Kolkata believe she can still return a hero&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in Bangladesh they are deemed criminals and fugitives, facing charges of crimes against humanity, murder, sedition or embezzlement. But in the comfort of the crowded food courts of Kolkata shopping malls, over black coffee and Indian fast food, the exiled politicians of the Awami League sit plotting their political comeback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 16 months ago,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/26/bangladesh-student-protests-mass-movement-against-dictator&quot;&gt; a revolution against Bangladesh’s autocratic prime minister&lt;/a&gt; Sheikh Hasina forced her to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/05/bangladesh-pm-has-resigned-and-left-country-media-reports-say-sheikh-hasina&quot;&gt;dramatically flee the country&lt;/a&gt;, jumping on a helicopter to India as an enraged onslaught of protesters marched towards her residence. The streets she left behind &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/10/bangladesh-ousted-sheikh-hasina-charged-with-crimes-against-humanity&quot;&gt;were bloody&lt;/a&gt;; her regime’s final crackdown on protesters in the July uprising had left as many as 1,400 dead, &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1160046&quot;&gt;according to a UN report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/03/exiled-awami-league-members-political-comeback-india&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>&apos;Unlawful&apos;: Bangladesh HC questions BCB over female crickters&apos; safety</title>

      <description>The Bangladesh High Court questioned the BCB’s failure to ensure a safe, harassment-free environment for women cricketers. It asked why such inaction should not be declared “unlawful, without lawful authority, and against public interest.” The court ordered BCB to implement its anti-sexual harassment policy and submit a report, following a writ over delayed action on harassment allegations.</description>

      <title>Wangchuk tried to create Nepal and Bangladesh-like unrest: Govt tells SC</title>

      <description>Appearing before a bench of Justices Aravind Kumar and P B Varale, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the activist was appealing to Gen Z to come out on the street against govt to create a problem in Ladakh which is very sensitive as it shares borders with countries that are not very friendly. Responding to Wangchuk’s submission that he was holding a peaceful protest against govt on the line of Gandhian principles, the SG said, “Gandhi was just a facade to hide his real intention of instigating violence.”</description>

      <title>Cheer for exports: Textiles, carpets, leather set to gain after India-US deal</title>

      <description>With the trade deal announced, Indian goods are suddenly looking more competitive. This means that a product will face 18% additional tariff over the MFN or product-specific rate. At 18%, the levy on Indian garments will be marginally lower than the 20% faced by those made in Bangladesh or Sri Lanka.</description>

      <title>Pakistan team lands in Sri Lanka for T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970625/pakistan-team-lands-in-sri-lanka-for-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan cricket team on Monday arrived in Sri Lanka for the T20 World Cup, which is set to begin on February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on X, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said that a 15-player squad had arrived in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The 15-player national squad includes Captain Salman Ali Agha, Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Mohammad Naeef, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Usman Khan, and Usman Tariq,” the PCB said in an earlier post, the informed of the squad’s department for the global event’s venue.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the latest update about the aquad’s arrival in Colombo, the board said the team would rest on Monday and Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The team will play a warm-up match against Ireland on Feb 4,” PCB added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, is set to begin on Feb 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;gave the go-ahead &lt;/a&gt;for Pakistan’s participation in the tournament, but barred it from playing against arch-rival India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement came amid uncertainty regarding a possible boycott of the tournament over Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;withdrawal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; following tensions with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh. According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Pakistan’s decision to boycott its T20 World Cup 2026 match against India has reignited the debate over politics in cricket. While the ICC has raised concerns over selective participation, the move contrasts with Pakistan’s past, when teams like New Zealand, Australia, England and Bangladesh repeatedly refused to tour the country due to security fears, forcing Pakistan into years of isolation.</description>

      <description>Environmental activist Sonam Wangchuk, detained under NSA, is accused by the Centre of inciting Ladakh&apos;s youth for protests inspired by regime-toppling movements. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta told the Supreme Court that Wangchuk&apos;s speeches, referencing Nepal, Bangladesh, and the Arab Spring, aimed to create a rift between the people and the government.

      <description>&lt;span&gt;India wants to reset relations after Bangladesh elections. It will be easier said than done&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Expert comment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;LToremark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2026-02-02T13:36:14+00:00&quot; title=&quot;Monday, 2 February, 2026&quot;&gt;2 February 2026&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;India is hoping a new democratically elected government in Bangladesh will help improve bilateral relations. But identity politics in both countries could derail progress.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class=&quot;media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;img alt=&quot;Prime Minister Narendra Modi, waits to welcome his Bangladeshi counterpart Sheikh Hasina at the Hyderabad House on 22 June 2024 in New Delhi, India.&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2026-02/2026-02-02-india-bangladesh-2158192560.jpg?itok=uKGpDpPc&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;As Bangladesh prepares to hold elections on 12 February – after almost 18 months under an unelected interim government – India is seeking a reset in bilateral relations. The relationship between Dhaka and New Delhi has deteriorated after the government of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August 2024 following large-scale unrest in which some 1,400 people were killed. India’s historically close relations with Hasina’s party – the Awami League – fuelled allegations that New Delhi empowered her government’s increasingly autocratic tendencies. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that Hasina fled to India and has continued to make &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bangladeshs-ousted-leader-hasina-denounces-the-upcoming-election-from-her-exile-in-india/article70564132.ece&quot;&gt;statements&lt;/a&gt; from there has added to the bad blood, as has the verdict issued in November which found her guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced her to death. Bangladesh and India maintain an extradition treaty, but New Delhi has so far refused to extradite Hasina on the grounds that it has the right to refuse requests if the offence is of a ‘political character’.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Delhi fears that Hasina’s removal from power has created space for groups that are hostile towards India, amid growing anti-India rhetoric and violence in Bangladesh. Attacks on minorities – including Bangladesh’s 13 million-strong Hindu population – have exacerbated tensions. The Bangladeshi government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/events/all/open-event/conversation-he-professor-muhammad-yunus-chief-advisor-bangladesh&quot; title=&quot;In conversation with HE Professor Muhammad Yunus, Chief Advisor of Bangladesh&quot;&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that such attacks have been exaggerated and are largely politically motivated, not about religious affiliation. The murder in December of a Bangladeshi youth activist who had been critical of India triggered further unrest, including the lynching of a Hindu man. Claims that the suspects &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiatoday.in/world/story/osman-hadi-shooting-murder-2-suspects-flee-to-india-via-meghalaya-say-bangladesh-police-2842886-2025-12-28&quot;&gt;fled to India&lt;/a&gt; worsened relations between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reflecting the poor state of bilateral relations, India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.firstpost.com/world/budget-2026-as-bangladeshs-yunus-pivots-to-pakistan-india-cuts-aid-by-half-13974945.html&quot;&gt;halved&lt;/a&gt; its financial assistance to Bangladesh in its latest budget.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Geopolitical faultlines&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;align-right embedded-entity embed&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding insult to injury is the Bangladeshi government’s outreach to countries that have historically difficult relations with India, including China and Pakistan. But close ties with China are not new. Beijing has been a longstanding trade, investment and defence partner for Bangladesh – more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2024-03/fs_2403_at_2023.pdf&quot;&gt;70 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of the country’s arms imports came from China in the 2019-23 period for example. Nonetheless, India fears that China is seeking to exploit its deteriorating relations with Bangladesh. In June, Bangladesh, China and Pakistan held the inaugural &lt;a href=&quot;https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/inaugural-meeting-of-bangladesh-china-pakistan-trilateral-mechanism&quot;&gt;meeting&lt;/a&gt; of a foreign secretary/vice foreign minister dialogue. This parallels a similar initiative between Afghanistan, China and Pakistan. New Delhi views this as an effort to marginalize India in its own neighbourhood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a visit to China in March 2025, Bangladesh’s Chief Adviser Muhammed Yunus &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/7-states-of-india-are-landlocked-yunus-says-bangladesh-only-guardian-of-ocean-invites-china-to-make-extension/articleshow/119801894.cms&quot;&gt;referred&lt;/a&gt; to India’s ‘landlocked’ northeastern states and said Bangladesh is the ‘only guardian of the ocean’ that could serve as an ‘extension of the Chinese economy’. This did not go down well in New Delhi. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/asia-pacific/china&quot; title=&quot;China&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt; is involved in several high-profile infrastructure projects in Bangladesh, including modernization of the Mongla Port – its second-largest seaport – and a water management project along the Teesta River. The latter is of particular concern to New Delhi as Bangladesh and India have been engaged in stalled negotiations on sharing the river waters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dhaka’s engagement with Islamabad have seen a more notable shift. The two countries have had historically strained relations following Bangladesh’s secession from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/asia-pacific/pakistan&quot; title=&quot;Pakistan&quot;&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; in 1971 following a violent independence struggle. Improved relations have seen a relaxation of visa rules and trade restrictions, the establishment of direct sea links between Chittagong and Karachi and several senior-level interactions. Dhaka and Islamabad have also discussed deepening defence cooperation. For example, Bangladesh is considering &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbsnews.net/foreign-policy/bangladesh-pakistan-air-chiefs-talk-potential-procurement-jf-17-thunder-aircraft&quot;&gt;procuring&lt;/a&gt; the JF-17 fighter aircraft, which is jointly produced by China and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Identity politics could derail a reset&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;India is hoping the return to democratic rule in Bangladesh will help reset relations. In preparation, New Delhi has sought to deepen and diversify its political engagement with Bangladesh, to dispel allegations surrounding its historic ties with the Awami League. India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Yunus met on the sidelines of a conference in Bangkok in April and Modi sent a condolence letter following the death of Khaleda Zia – leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) – in December. Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar also attended Zia’s funeral where he met her son, Tarique Rahman. Rahman has recently returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in exile and is widely tipped to be the next prime minister if the BNP performs well in the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, identity politics in both countries threatens to derail progress. A new government in Dhaka that is overtly hostile towards India, for example one that includes Islamic hardliners, will make rapprochement difficult. Even a BNP-led government does not guarantee improved relations. In an interview, Rahman &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/4cbaczb5zv?tpcc=south_asia_brief&quot;&gt;stated &lt;/a&gt;that ‘the people of Bangladesh have decided that relations will remain cool. So, I have to stand with my country’s people’. When the BNP ruled Bangladesh in 2001-06 relations with India deteriorated amid growing instability along the border and a surge in terrorist activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;align-left embedded-entity embed&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A shift in mindset towards India will be dictated in part by the issue of Hasina’s extradition. Publicly, New Delhi will remain averse to extraditing her. Privately, however, the Indian government will be looking to make the issue go away, for example by Hasina moving onto a third country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In India, meanwhile, attacks on Bangladeshi Hindus have become a prominent issue in public and media discourse. India will be holding elections this year in two states that border Bangladesh – Assam and West Bengal – which could see an increase in anti-Bangladesh rhetoric in the run-up to the polls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The credibility of the Bangladeshi election and its outcome will also determine the trajectory of the bilateral relationship. A low voter turnout fuelled by violence could undermine the credibility of the electoral process. Supporters of the Awami League have threatened to disrupt the elections after the party has been effectively banned from standing in the election. The former foreign minister in the Hasina government, Hasan Mahmud, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/excluding-awami-league-from-upcoming-election-will-not-bring-stability-to-bangladesh-says-party-leader-in-delhi/article70519694.ece?tpcc=south_asia_brief&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; stability will not return to Bangladesh if the Awami League is excluded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Former ICC official Sami-ul-Hasan Burney criticised the BCCI&apos;s public handling of Mustafizur Rahman&apos;s IPL exit, suggesting it triggered Bangladesh&apos;s withdrawal and Pakistan&apos;s forfeited match. Burney also highlighted PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi&apos;s view of the ICC&apos;s stance on match venue changes as &quot;shifting of goalposts.&quot;</description>

      <title>Pakistan team heads to Sri Lanka for T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970625/pakistan-team-heads-to-sri-lanka-for-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan cricket team on Monday departed for Sri Lanka for the T20 World Cup, which is set to begin on February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on X, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said that a 15-player squad was departing for Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheRealPCBMedia/status/2018256319354990726&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The 15-player national squad includes Captain Salman Ali Agha, Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Mohammad Naeef, Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan, Saim Ayub, Shadab Khan, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Usman Khan, and Usman Tariq,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said that the team would rest on Monday and Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The team will play a warm-up match against Ireland on Feb 4,” PCB added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, is set to begin on Feb 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;gave the go-ahead &lt;/a&gt;for Pakistan’s participation in the tournament, but barred it from playing against arch-rival India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement came amid uncertainty regarding a possible boycott of the tournament over Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;withdrawal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; following tensions with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh. According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Principles before commercial interests’: Cricketers, politicians react to Pakistan boycotting India match in T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970619/principles-before-commercial-interests-cricketers-politicians-react-to-pakistan-boycotting-india-match-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The government on Sunday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;gave the cricket team the nod&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the upcoming T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held on Feb 15 in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development came after uncertainty over the country’s participation in the tournament following Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;withdrawal&lt;/a&gt; amid tensions with India, which is one of the co-hosts of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh. According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development, even before the official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the International Cricket Council (ICC), in a statement, mentioned the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is what athletes, politicians, and journalists had to say about the development:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Pakistan all-rounder Shahid Afridi, in a post on X, termed the development “regrettable” but voiced support for the government’s decision nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve always believed cricket can open doors when politics closes them. It’s regrettable that Pakistan won’t play India at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/trends/T20WorldCup&quot;&gt;#T20WorldCup&lt;/a&gt;, but I stand behind my government’s decision,” Afridi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the moment for ICC to lead and prove through decisions, not statements, that it is impartial, independent and fair to every member,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SAfridiOfficial/status/2018209584733966458&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former cricketer Muhammad Hafeez also took to X to express disappointment at the development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stated that the current tensions began with “no handshake by the Indian [side]” — in a reference to the September controversy where the Indian team refused to shake hands with their rivals at the toss and after an Asia Cup match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not [an] ideal situation for fans of cricket. Worried,” Hafeez added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MHafeez22/status/2018014655235633379&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Pakistan batsman Muhammad Yousuf was of the opinion that the government had taken a “tough but necessary stand”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Principles must come before commercial interests. The ‘selective’ influence in world cricket needs to end for the game to truly be global. We play with pride, but we also stand for equality and justice in sports,” he posted on X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another post, Yousuf expressed regret that Pakistan vs India “is one of the greatest sporting events in the world, yet it continues to suffer from political interference that damages the spirit and pride of the game”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In such an unfair environment, choosing not to play becomes an act of principle — an eye‑for‑an‑eye response to protect the integrity of the sports,” he asserted.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former England cricketer Kevin Pietersen was curious to know if Pakistan would also not play against India in the final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Not sure if India can meet Pakistan in this World Cup final due to groups and play-offs, but if they can, would Pakistan refuse to play the World Cup final?” he posted on X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sports journalist Yahya Hussaini, meanwhile, commented that in international cricket, the PCB “is a reality”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the government’s decision, there remains “no legal standing for any action against the board. There are two weeks available to persuade the Pakistan Cricket Board”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former senator Mushahid Hussain welcomed the announcement, lauding the PCB for standing in solidarity with Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on X, he said: “Good decision ⁦PCB. After blatant double-standards demonstrated by ⁦ICC at the cricket world cup when India refused to play in Pakistan, ICC bowed before India unconditionally but when, similarly, Bangladesh sought a change of venue in India, they were denied!”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Author Nadeem Farooq Paracha welcomed the move as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A clever response to toothless ICC and its master, the BCCI (Board of Control for Cricket in India).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This will put them in a fix. A checkmate move,” Paracha said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif said ICC’s “efficiency” in reacting to Pakistan’s decision “seemed more of a panic”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First, not welcoming Pakistan’s selective participation and towards the end, requesting PCB to reconsider preserving cricket’s ecosystem,” he said about the ICC’s statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latif also questioned, “Where was ICC when Australia and West Indies forfeited their matches in 1996, England refused to travel to Harare and New Zealand to Nairobi in 2003?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that Zimbabwe did not participate in the T20 World in 2009 and were still compensated with the participation fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“ICC must realise they have been checkmated. Interesting times ahead?” he asked.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;ICC’s reaction&lt;/a&gt; to Pakistan’s decision, former human rights minister Shireen Mazari said: “The ICC is fast deteriorating into the Indian Cricket Council, promoting Indian bullying — time for some restructuring.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veteran Indian commentator Harsha Bhogle said if there was an “inevitable reduction in the ICC’s revenue caused by Pakistan’s forfeit and future uncertainty, the least affected countries, given other strong sources of revenue, will be India, Australia and England”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The most affected will be those completely reliant on revenues from the ICC; not just the smaller and associate nations but also the West Indies, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and …… Pakistan!”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Harbhajan Singh slammed Pakistan&apos;s decision to boycott their T20 World Cup match against India as &quot;unnecessary drama.&quot; He questioned the logic behind the conditional approval, suggesting it&apos;s a ploy to mislead people and project solidarity with Bangladesh.

      <title>How the US Misreads Bangladesh: Backing Dubious Figures Can Have Dangerous Implications</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/how-us-misreads-bangladesh-backing-dubious-figures-can-have-dangerous-implications</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh is almost entirely surrounded by India, with Myanmar forming a smaller eastern frontier. India remains the dominant regional power and Bangladesh’s most consequential neighbor in economic, cultural, and security terms. Any American strategy in Bangladesh that ignores India is inherently flawed. Aligning regionally with Pakistan—a country with which Bangladesh shares a traumatic history—offers Washington no meaningful strategic advantage in Dhaka.  &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After around a week of uncertainty, the government gave the nod on Sunday to the Pakistan cricket team for participation in the T20 World Cup but barred it from playing against India on February 15, when the Green Shirts are scheduled to play their only group-stage match against the arch-rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan grants approval to the Pakistan cricket team to participate in the ICC World T20 2026, however, the Pakistan cricket team shall not take the field in the match scheduled on 15th February 2026 against India,” a post of the government’s X account said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Pakistan Cricket Board chief and Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969177&quot;&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as the possibility of a boycott of the T20 World Cup loomed over Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;withdrawal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the meeting, Naqvi had said he had briefed the PM on the “International Cricket Council (ICC) matter” and a “final decision would be taken either on Friday or next Monday”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting took place as questions were raised about Pakistan’s participation in the tournament following the ICC’s decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland on January 24, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governing ICC had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rejected &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bangladesh’s request to move their matches to tournament co-host Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours before the ICC had announced its decision, Naqvi had said that Bangladesh was being treated unfairly and should be allowed to participate in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, he had said that Pakistan’s participation was still not confirmed. “The prime minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I’ll be able to give you our final decision,” Naqvi had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#selective-participation&quot; id=&quot;selective-participation&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Selective participation’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC reacted to Pakistan’s and noted in a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/media-releases/icc-statement-on-icc-men-s-t20-world-cup-2026&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; that the Pakistan government had directed its team to “selectively participate” in the global tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the ICC awaits official communication from the Pakistan Cricket Board, this position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that ICC tournaments were built on sporting integrity, competitiveness, consistency and fairness, and “selective participation undermines the spirit and sanctity of the competitions”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the ICC respects the roles of governments in matters of national policy, this decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide, including millions in Pakistan,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC hopes that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup which should also be the responsibility of all its members including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the statement concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events underline the current tension in South Asian cricket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, is set to begin on February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan have been placed in the same group as defending champions India, but will play all their matches in Sri Lanka under an arrangement brokered by the ICC, allowing them to play at a neutral venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2025, a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;hybrid model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” was decided upon whereby India played all their matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1894430#:~:text=The%20deal%20means%20Pakistan%20will%20play%20at%20a%20neutral%20venue%20in%20any%20ICC%20tournament%20hosted%20by%20India%20until%202027.&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;compromise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan are set to play all their matches at the upcoming T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Crime control or state criminality? Policing, power and impunity in Punjab</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969181/crime-control-or-state-criminality-policing-power-and-impunity-in-punjab</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The script is familiar: while attempting to apprehend or transport a suspect in custody, law enforcement agents come under fire from him and/or his accomplices, “forcing the police to retaliate”, resulting in deaths on the civilian side with almost no casualties — barring perhaps some injuries — reported on the side of state agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistanis are quite well-versed in this story. Some may even have naively assumed that after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1384767&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;extrajudicial killing of Naqeebullah Mehsud&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the subsequent high-profile investigation of former Sindh Police SSP Rao Anwar, the tide would turn. It did, to a degree, in Karachi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overview of media reports shows that annual encounter killings fell from 500-700 between 2013 and 2015 — the peak years of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1772026&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Karachi Operation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — to 30-60 in the aftermath of&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1733342&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Anwar’s trial&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While some in the police hailed the ex-Malir SSP and other “encounter specialists” partly for their “&lt;em&gt;daleri”&lt;/em&gt; and for navigating class-based hierarchical and structural discrimination within the police — a dynamic I have unpacked in my &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09670106241245262&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — others appeared to have realised that the “encounter policy” had to be abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet it remains a practice too lucrative for violence workers who are keen to operationalise state policy, and a form of state-sanctioned violence considered to be both effective and efficient by political leaders eager to demonstrate governance “successes” through questionably calculated crime statistics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The supposed “respectable public” (read: the elite), on its part, turns a blind eye to such state criminality as those fatally removed from society and deprived of life — the alleged rapist, murderer, dacoit, robber, gangster, drug dealer — are perceived worthy of such punishment, for whom the rule of law and legal formalities and technicalities need not apply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For policymakers, law enforcers, and the public, collectively, these dynamics are easier to accept when a broader political climate has prioritised a “hard state” approach towards all forms of internal and external “threats”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#zero-tolerance-policing&quot; id=&quot;zero-tolerance-policing&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Zero-tolerance policing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of early 2025, the Crime Control Department (CCD) of Punjab Police and its political patrons have followed a tried and tested script. Established through an executive order following the provincial cabinet’s approval last year, the department’s powers and mandate have been enshrined into law through the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961340&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; Police Order (Amendment) Ordinance 2025&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to include operational and investigative police work, legal work, intelligence and data collection through varied forms of surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overly empowered specialised police unit, created to realise the chief minister’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963081&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;zero crime policy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”, the CCD has been given a free hand to enforce zero tolerance policing. Its performance is reminiscent of Zulfikar Ali &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/737999/a-leaf-from-history-fsf-the-dreaded-organisation&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bhutto’s Federal Security Force&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and beyond Pakistan, the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2020/10/22/sars-a-brief-history-of-a-rogue-unit&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Special Anti-Robbery Squad&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Nigeria, and the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/publications/para-militarization-and-a-culture-of-impunity-in-policing-a-study/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rapid Action Battalion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Bangladesh — examples of elite policing units designed to “eliminate” serious and organised crime, terrorism, and other national or internal security threats, including political opposition, while significantly breaching human rights and civil liberties.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been estimated that between January and June 2025, more than 400 suspected criminals were killed in over 800 CCD encounters. According to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1948812&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;estimates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan from October last year, more than 670 fatalities resulted in police encounters in Punjab, “a figure higher than in any other province”. We are told the victims have included dacoits, drug dealers, gang members, child abusers, sexual harassers, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959617&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;petition &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;filed in the Lahore High Court last month, 1,100 citizens were killed in such encounters since the formation of the CCD. It states that “fake encounters are being used as an alternative to the criminal justice system”, and are thus illegal and unconstitutional. The application followed several statements and judgments by the superior courts last year, during which government officials, including the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the Punjab Police chiefs, were summoned and directed to ensure that constitutional protections are afforded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the FIA is legally required to investigate deaths and torture in police custody, as of November last year, not a single investigation has &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://voicepk.net/2025/12/fake-encounters-petition-filed-in-lahore-high-court-against-ccd/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reportedly&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; taken place into the CCD’s reported encounter killings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department, meanwhile, rejects claims of fake or staged encounters, with their spokesperson &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://voicepk.net/2025/09/ccd-encounters-12-suspects-killed-in-three-days/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;arguing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “These criminals do not welcome us with flowers, they shoot at us the moment they see us … during these operations, if a &lt;em&gt;few individuals&lt;/em&gt; are killed, it accounts for not even one per cent of our overall activities” (emphasis added).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final month of 2025 saw dozens of such “few individuals” reportedly killed in encounters by CCD personnel, shortly after the LHC petition was filed. On a single day, in a “series of encounters” across the province, at least&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958715&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; 23 suspected drug dealers were killed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with at least 16 in Gujranwala alone. The figure alone should set the alarm bells ringing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the persistence of police encounter killings — and the lack of transparency, investigations, or accountability around them — indicates criminality on the part of the state, the complacency of the “respectable public”, and the limits of institutional reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#police-violence-a-state-crime&quot; id=&quot;police-violence-a-state-crime&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Police violence: a state crime&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An emerging sub-field of critical criminology, led by &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.plutobooks.com/product/state-crime/#:~:text=Penny%20Green%20and%20Tony%20Ward%20put%20forward%20a%20powerful%20argument,of%20deviance%20and%20human%20rights.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Penny Green and Tony Ward&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, challenges conventional criminological and legal perspectives that remain focused on state-centric definitions of what constitutes a crime, seldom holding states accountable for their own criminality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Green and Ward define state crime as “state organisational deviance involving the violation of human rights”, such as genocide, crimes against humanity, torture, state terrorism, and even police violence. State crime scholarship offers a critical lens that helps assess how states avoid their responsibility to protect citizens and breach human rights laws and international frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State law enforcement agencies are empowered with the monopoly to use legitimate force, equipped with the discretion to decide when and under what circumstances the deployment of such force becomes necessary. In other words, coercion or the use of force is the defining feature of modern policing. Also, a core task of modern policing systems is preserving the status quo and maintaining a class-based social order.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substantial research has now established that in our postcolonial world, policing has traditionally been a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://forskning.ruc.dk/en/publications/policing-as-pacification-postcolonial-legacies-transnational-conn/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;militarised project&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (despite its “civilian” descriptives); that the idea that the police enforce the law through public consent is &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/book/45051/chapter-abstract/385527510?redirectedFrom=fulltext&amp;amp;login=false&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;outdated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;; and, extrajudicial police violence cannot be attributed to a single person or a single elite police unit, but rather is usually symptomatic of &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hurstpublishers.com/book/insecure-guardians/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;regime-centric considerations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relatedly, when there are political incentives to use excessive force — following the declaration of a war, a state of emergency, or a national security threat — the police are unlikely to exercise restraint. In other words, when a government decides to adopt a zero-tolerance approach to crime (which the state itself defines), it also incentivises law enforcement agents to engage in zero-tolerance policing, which almost always invokes the extrajudicial use of force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In such scenarios, the state is complicit in fostering an environment in which police encounter killings can endure. By extension, therefore, a case may be made that the persistence of police encounter killings is an example of state organisational deviancy that violates human rights. That is, a crime on the part of the state (unless established otherwise).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#state--and-elite-sanctioned-repression&quot; id=&quot;state--and-elite-sanctioned-repression&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;State- and elite-sanctioned repression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond the state and its agents, we must also question the legitimacy that such practices draw from Pakistan’s social structure. In their book, Green and Ward argue that the “respectable public” seldom deals directly with the police and rarely witnesses the ‘uglier’ side of policing that the working classes are subjected to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When presented with narratives of “eliminating threats”, the respectable public is likely to give the police the benefit of the doubt. The respectable public is also less likely to witness excessive police violence; equipped with legal and political power, they are more likely to challenge police violence and sanction law enforcement agents should they be subjected to coercive behaviour. Privilege and power may work in tandem to protect the respectable public from being subjected to such forms of repression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called “rough public”, on the other hand (described as “wild”, “uncivilised”, “dispossessed”), the working class — who must be kept at sufficient distance from the respectables — are the ones more likely to bear the brunt of police coercion. Frequently invisibilised from the gated spaces and gazes of the respectable public, state deviancy against the “rough public” is often easy to ignore, and their victimisation can be narrated as: “&lt;em&gt;inn ke saath aisa hi hona chahiye (this is exactly what should happen with them)”&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State criminality in the form of extrajudicial police killings is not just a product of decisions undertaken by our political elite; it is, in fact, a result of the direct or indirect complacency of the ‘respectable public’ who support the repression of marginalised and ‘othered’ populations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, entire communities have been dehumanised and even demonised based on their ethnic identities, histories, and political demands, which thereby leads sections of the society into justifying state violence against these groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, the manifestation of police militarisation and zero-tolerance policing in the form of extrajudicial police killings is a collective product of state- and elite-sanctioned repression. It is no surprise, therefore, that police encounters have been widely popular in Pakistan’s history and imagination, and indeed across South Asia, legitimised through religious and cultural narratives of morality, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/50/2/320/386524&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;dharma&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07352166.2022.2091448&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;securitised &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;chronicles that present select communities as ‘our internal enemies’. The place and popularity of Punjab’s Crime Control Department must be understood against these socio-political processes, and Pakistan’s classist social structure more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#the-limits-of-institutional-reform&quot; id=&quot;the-limits-of-institutional-reform&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The limits of institutional reform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, we must also ask: what sort of police organisational reform is being implemented in Punjab? This inquiry is not limited to legal reform in the shape of amendments to the Police Order, which call for independent and impartial oversight, or independent investigations into police violence. Beyond this, substantial transformative changes are taking place in Punjab — as in other parts of Pakistan — through the digitalisation of policing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PML-N championed police digitalisation in the province, promoting the expansions of various smart policing projects that aim to make the force more operationally effective and aid in its investigative capacity. The goal is to improve public safety and security in Punjab through tech-driven surveillance. This digitalisation mission has extended to the CCD, which has been equipped with a technical wing to maintain databases, digital repositories of gang members, facilitators, family members, and more, as well as access to call data record, locations, audio and video surveillance, geo-fencing, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In theory, police digitalisation should make policing more efficient, effective, and transparent, reducing reliance upon extra-legal and extra-judicial violence on the part of law enforcement agents. Yet, open-source data and media reports indicate that CCD encounter killings have often taken place in cities where such projects have been rolled out. These digitalisation initiatives geographically overlap with CCD encounters, including in Lahore, Multan, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Sialkot, and Bahawalpur.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overlap between such digital surveillance infrastructure and the heightened use of police extrajudicial violence is interesting, to say the least. It doesn’t necessarily prove that individual incidents have taken place where Punjab Safe Cities Authority cameras are present; this overlap is difficult to establish in the absence of reliable CCD data. But we can still ask: Is the state’s digital surveillance technology extending into spaces where such encounters take place? If yes, then can such surveillance footage be made public if and when independent investigations into police killings are initiated?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transformational changes in law enforcement through technological advancements, if regulated properly, must amount to greater police accountability. Even though international research on police digitalisation (such as the use of body-worn cameras, CCTV cameras, and other predictive policing tools) remains inconclusive — there is no convincing correlation between digitalisation and a reduction in police violence (yet) — these tools may deter individual officers from abusing discretion. Beyond this, state policies, social structure, perceptions, attitudes, and police institutional culture remain dominant drivers of excessive use of force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#police-violence-state-crime-and-human-rights&quot; id=&quot;police-violence-state-crime-and-human-rights&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Police violence, state crime and human rights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the continued reliance upon this practice shows a criminal justice system in deep crisis. The persistence of this practice — on the part of the state and law enforcers — signals a profound lack of trust and faith by legal authorities in the very judicial and legal processes that they are meant to uphold. Rather than strengthening the investigation, prosecution, and adjudication, the state has normalised lethal &lt;em&gt;jugaad&lt;/em&gt; that bypass constitutional safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, encounters are unconstitutional. They violate &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pakistani.org/pakistan/constitution/part2.ch1.html&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Article 9 of the Constitution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which guarantees the right to life and liberty, particularly when constitutional scrutiny is disallowed or avoided, and Article 10A, which guarantees the right to a fair trial and due process. They also show a disregard for the Police Order; under this law, police use of lethal force must be independently reviewed. Failure to investigate, register a first information report in the aftermath of a killing in police custody, or conduct a judicial inquiry into the killing, are all violations of fundamental rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2022, the government also passed the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/1415360249_881.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Torture and Custodial Death (Prevention and Punishment) Act&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which criminalises torture, custodial rape, and custodial death. Yet, many encounters take place while the suspect is in custody, as the police designate the killing of a suspect as ‘self-defence’, conveniently avoiding the application of the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958151&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ruling &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in the Zaryab Khan case in November 2025 further underscores the unconstitutionality of this practice by holding that Khan’s custodial death in Dera Ghazi Khan in FIA’s custody violated the Constitution. “The Constitution imposes a duty upon the State to protect the right to life of every citizen and to prevent custodial violence and killings,” the SC reasoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Justice Mandokhail &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958288&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;emphasised&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “the constitutional guarantees against illegal detention, arrest, brutality, torture, and extrajudicial killings in any form are bedrock legal and fundamental principles enshrined in the Constitution” and “the right to life has been categorised as the supreme human right, which is codified in every major human rights treaty”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the case exposed entrenched police impunity, it also revealed something more troubling: persistent, unchecked extrajudicial killings are not merely instances of misconduct or institutional failure but indicate criminality on the part of the state itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s obligations under the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/en/instruments-mechanisms/instruments/international-covenant-civil-and-political-rights&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (ICCPR) reinforce this conclusion. Having ratified the treaty, Pakistan is bound to prohibit the arbitrary deprivation of life and ensure impartial investigations into state-caused deaths. In spite of this, no impartial investigations are carried out, indicating the systematic lack of accountability on the part of the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is unsurprising, therefore, that in July last year, the Lahore High Court &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1926231&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;directed &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;the police chief of Punjab to review the incidents of encounter killings by the CCD. In December again, the court &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959617&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;issued notices&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to the Punjab government and the chief of police. To what extent these interventions restrain the CCD remains to be seen. For now, state officials typically narrate the script mentioned at the beginning of this article to the media, which is printed or reported with little independent questioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In sum, the police violence raging in Punjab is a form of state organisational deviance that violates fundamental human rights to a degree that could be framed as criminality on the part of the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we celebrate reductions in crime rates as successful manifestations of a ‘zero-crime policy’, we must critically re-evaluate the structures of colonial-era policing and the cultures of legality that we are cementing in Pakistan, bolstering the militarisation of the criminal justice system, at the cost of radical institutional reforms that the country’s criminal justice system desperately needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is the “respectable public” going to wait for another high-profile killing that tarnishes the country’s domestic and international reputation before we can openly challenge the legitimacy of this practice? Will we remain agnostic to the legal restrictions that are imposed upon arbitrary state power?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why are there so few women candidates?</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970536/why-are-there-so-few-women-candidates</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; Only 78 women contesting the national election.&amp;mdash;Courtesy The Daily Star &quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/697ffb452d380.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Only 78 women contesting the national election.—Courtesy The Daily Star&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE number of women contesting the upcoming parliamentary elections starkly exposes the persistent under-representation of women in Bangladesh’s politics. Of the 1,981 candidates competing in the polls, only 78 are women. This glaring imbalance reflects the deep-rooted chauvinism and discrimination faced by women with political ambition. Moreover, nearly a third of nominated women candidates are wives, daughters, or relatives of influential men, indicating how difficult it is for women to participate in politics independently and on their own merit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reality is particularly troubling in a country where women constitute half the population yet make up less than four percent of electoral candidates. Of the 78 women, only 17 are independents. As an analysis of Election Commission data by The Daily Star shows, around 30 parties have not nominated a single woman candidate. Two-thirds of parliamentary seats have no female contenders at all, and women with familial or marital ties to powerful political figures are far more likely to succeed than those without such connections. Thus, women are still not regarded as serious contenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exclusion of women is especially disheartening given their central role in the 2024 uprising, where women mobilised, organised, and took significant risks alongside men. Yet, their participation has not translated into greater political representation. Instead, women have increasingly been pushed out of public and political spaces, both overtly through exclusion and more insidiously by intimidation. Anti-women rhetoric has intensified both online and offline in recent times, sometimes driven by religion-based political groups seeking to silence women’s voices. Even the few women who have dared to contest elections have faced coordinated online attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Existing legal frameworks have done little to address the prevailing imbalance. The Representation of the People Order, 1972 requires political parties to reserve at least 33 percent of committee posts for women, including at the central level. Yet, most parties have failed to comply with this provision. Even one of the country’s largest and oldest parties, the BNP, has nominated fewer than ten women, while Jamaat-e-Islami has fielded none. Electoral politics in Bangladesh — shaped by money, patronage, and muscle power — systematically disadvantages women as parties, focused solely on winning seats, continue to prioritise male candidates. Women nominees are often expected to rely on the backing of fathers, husbands, or brothers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political parties have failed women and the spirit of July uprising&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the proposal by the Women’s Affairs Reform Commission to increase the number of reserved seats to 100 with direct elections was not accepted by political parties. With no women representatives included in the July Charter consensus discussions, it was unsurprising that reserved seats were kept at only 50, with no provision for direct elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we are serious about democratic reform, women’s presence in parliament and political leadership must be substantially increased. A democracy cannot claim legitimacy when half its population remains so poorly represented. Political parties must move beyond tokenism and actively invest in developing women leaders, ensuring they have equal opportunities to compete, win, and shape the country’s future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan’s export  fragility exposed</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970476/pakistans-export-fragility-exposed</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The recently finalised &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969805&quot;&gt;EU–India Free Trade Agreement&lt;/a&gt; (FTA), described by Brussels as “the mother of all agreements”, is a crucial development that should prompt Pakistan to reassess its export strategy. The European Union or EU is not just another market for Pakistan; it is the cornerstone of the country’s export economy. Approximately 40pc of Pakistan’s exports head to the EU, with textiles and clothing representing nearly 76pc of those exports in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This heavy concentration on a single market and product category brings both advantages and risks. On one hand, European demand has traditionally been stable, and the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://trade.ec.europa.eu/access-to-markets/en/content/generalised-scheme-preferences-plus-gsp&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus &lt;/a&gt;(GSP+) has provided Pakistani exporters with sustained market access for value-added textiles. On the other hand, such reliance makes Pakistan highly vulnerable. Any reduction in competitiveness — whether through tariffs or non-tariff barriers — can quickly lead to lost orders, idle factories, job losses, and increased pressure on foreign exchange reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impact of the EU–India agreement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability of Pakistan’s export sector will potentially come under strain due to the EU–India agreement. Indian exports, including textiles, will benefit from phased tariff reductions, eventually achieving zero duties for key products. Pakistani exporters have long relied on their preferential margins under GSP+ to compete in Europe. However, even with these preferences, Pakistan’s textile exports to the EU do not match China’s volume, and its share in core product categories (HS codes 61, 62, and 63) is not significantly larger than India’s, despite the 10-12pc tariffs India was facing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As tariff preference margins diminish, the focus will shift from tariffs to core business fundamentals — areas where Pakistan has repeatedly delayed reforms. These include energy costs and reliability, turnaround times, compliance, exchange-rate stability, workforce skills, productivity, and product development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With India’s tariff disadvantage disappearing, even a 15pc reduction in Pakistan’s EU textile share would mean a loss of approximately $1.5bn in exports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without addressing these fundamentals in a comprehensive manner through benchmarking with alternative sourcing countries, Pakistan’s competitive edge will erode further. This is not to belittle the prime minister’s recent relief on energy and refinance costs, which will have a positive impact of about 2pc on exporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparative exposure:&lt;br /&gt;India vs Pakistan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparing India and Pakistan underscores the risks of over-concentration. For India, the EU is an important market, but not an existential one. In 2024, India exported $97.2 billion to the EU out of total global exports of $441.7bn, meaning only about 22pc of its exports were EU-bound. In contrast, about 42pc of Pakistan’s exports relied on the EU, highlighting a much greater exposure to market shocks.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In textiles alone, the EU imported roughly $9bn from India and $9.7bn from Pakistan in 2024. Although both countries are similar in export value, for Pakistan, textiles to the EU represent the engine of its export economy, while for India, they are just one component of a diverse export portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With India’s tariff disadvantage disappearing, even a small shift in EU orders could disproportionately harm Pakistan. There is significant product overlap and reliance on cotton; India’s costs are lower, productivity is higher, it has a scale benefit, and its man-made fibres are more competitive. A 15pc reduction in Pakistan’s EU textile share would mean a loss of approximately $1.5bn in exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While India is less likely to gain from Vietnam (which will benefit further from the EU–Vietnam FTA by 2027) or Bangladesh (which enjoys quota-free, duty-free access under Everything but Arms), India stands to benefit as buyers diversify away from China under the China+ thrust and choose to substitute some sourcing away from Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over time, India could add $3–4bn in additional textile exports to the EU. A third to a half of this could be at Pakistan’s cost, though buyers are unlikely to switch all sourcing away from Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended actions for Pakistan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, the GSP+ must be defended through visible action: The government must protect GSP+ by ensuring compliance with labour, environmental, and governance conventions. Export policy reforms, especially in energy, taxation, and exchange rates, are essential. Non-compliance puts export revenue at risk, especially as GSP+ has barely compensated for Pakistan’s 40pc higher energy costs compared to India — a cushion that may soon disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the reduction in energy cost as a result of the prime minister’s relief package, it remains significantly higher than our eyeball competitors. In the last year, the Indian Rupee has depreciated, while the Pakistan Rupee has appreciated in value, thus affecting export competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we have to move beyond tariff preferences. Exporters need to recognise that competing on tariff margins alone is no longer sufficient. The new focus must be on cost, quality, product range, sophistication, compliance, reliability, and trust. Addressing skills gaps, possibly by bringing in experienced supervisors from countries like Sri Lanka, will be vital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, standards-driven trade must be prioritised and prepped for. Europe is increasingly enforcing standards that act as “shadow tariffs” on non-compliant suppliers. Pakistani exporters must prepare for carbon reporting and evolving EU border adjustment mechanisms to maintain access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, Pakistan must diversify not only within textiles (eg, man-made fibres, technical textiles, performance wear, and design-led home products) but also geographically, by developing new export destinations. India’s resilience comes from market and product diversification, allowing it to adapt to changing conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Pakistan cannot influence the terms of the EU–India agreement, it can take decisive steps to ensure its textile industry remains competitive as preferences erode. The EU is a lifeline for Pakistan’s exports. It is crucial that Pakistan stops treating this market as a comfort zone and instead undertakes the necessary reforms to safeguard its economic future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Where next with private credit?</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970475/where-next-with-private-credit</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an economy scarred by one crisis after another, Pakistan’s banking sector has been a notable exception even as others struggled. With interest rates peaking at 22 per cent two years ago, sustained government borrowing allowed the sector to lock in high returns by parking liquidity in fixed Pakistan International Bonds (PIBs), earning bumper profits with minimal balance sheet risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the past is another country, and now things seem to be returning towards normalcy — whatever that means in Pakistan’s context. For the most part, monetary policy has already been eased as the key rates have reverted towards their long-term (20-year) average of 10.35pc, naturally raising expectations that it would revive private sector activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the data is troubling as private sector credit becomes increasingly divergent from the broader monetary cycle, reflecting structural incentives that favour the deployment of liquidity into government securities rather than lending to the real economy. The system is so warped that scheduled banks now put $1.01 into (mostly treasuries) for every dollar of deposits they mobilise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, advances-to-deposits slipped below 40pc and stood at 39.75pc by December, not too far away from the trough of 36.33pc seen at October end. Unsurprisingly, private sector credit as a share of GDP has been on a declining trend since Covid-19, and currently clocks at 9.2pc, down three percentage points (pps) from its level a decade ago. This stagnancy was particularly visible as 2025 closed with loans to the private sector at Rs10.67 trillion, barely inching up 1pc from the same period of the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While advances remain stagnant, the sectoral mix is broadly unchanged, with industrial and services sectors dominating lending, and agriculture and personal credit remaining sidelined&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peer analysis further illustrates the extent of this challenge, where our private credit-to-GDP is a fraction compared to economies like Bangladesh (35.8pc), Indonesia (36.4pc), Egypt (27.6pc), and the Philippines (49.81pc). In any case, while advances remain stagnant, the broader sectoral mix has broadly remained unchanged, where industrial and services sectors continue to dominate lending with contributions of 62pc and 19.4pc, respectively. Meanwhile, agriculture and personal credit remain sidelined, except for bank employees, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst much of the same old, there was nevertheless one glimmer of hope as small and medium enterprise (SME) financing witnessed one of the strongest years in recent history. Loans to this segment reached Rs952.5bn by 2025 end, surging by 52.6pc or Rs328bn from the same period of the previous year. As a result, its share in total private business loans crossed 10pc for the first time in the 2020s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credit where due, this growth was in large part enabled by targeted initiatives like first-loss guarantees, while the refinancing schemes of the past were phased out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In line with past trends, wholesale and retail trade remained the hot favourite, with outstanding advances of Rs326bn, outpacing manufacturing. Though nowhere near, advances to agri SMEs have also found momentum and soared by 64.5pc, well above the overall rate of 42.2pc. While data for December is not yet available, the growth has come on the back of a substantial increase in the number of borrowers, which has risen by more than 100,000 in the first six months of the previous year alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s perhaps more interesting is that even as the policy rate has declined by more than 1,200 basis points since 2022, spreads remain elevated and are near decade highs. In December, weighted average lending rates on incremental advances (excluding zero markup and interbank) stood at 11.8pps while those on deposits were 8.3pps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite understandably, microfinance banks had the largest delta of 23pps at the end of the year, followed by specialised institutions at 10pps, as per an analysis done by the Karachi School of Business &amp;amp; Leadership InsightLab in its 2025 Credit Review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the question is, where does our private credit ecosystem go from here? As macroeconomic stabilisation finds firmer footing and begins yielding results, demand for financing will almost certainly increase. But supply is another matter entirely, given that capital has a safer, more attractive home in federal government securities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue that it’s simply a matter of proper incentives. Help the sector reduce its risk and it will eventually build the capacity to lend without external support. In theory, this makes perfect sense. But if the past is any guide such interventions can just as easily create structural dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Islamabad, Dhaka explore ways to liaise in vocational training</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970553/islamabad-dhaka-explore-ways-to-liaise-in-vocational-training</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Bangladesh on Sunday expressed keen interest in learning from each other’s best practices in human resource development and labour export, including recruitment processes, skills training and reintegration mechanisms for returning workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the sidelines of the ‘Abu Dhabi Dialogue 2026’, Minister for Overseas Pak­istanis and Human Res­ource Development Chau­dhry Salik Hussain held a meeting with Adviser to Ministry of Expatriates’ Welfare and Overseas Employment of Bangladesh Dr Asif Nazrul in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the importance of structured collaboration, the two sides along with their respective delegations exchanged views on shared challenges faced by their overseas labour force and discussed best practices in skills development and training for expatriate workers, according to a press release of Pak­istani consulate in Dubai. Senior officials of Pak­istan and Bangladesh diplomatic missions in the UAE were also present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pakistani side briefed the meeting on the role and initiatives of the National Vocational and Technical Training Comm­ission, while the Ban­gladeshi side sha­red insights into the operational framework of its Tec­hnical Training Centres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Emp­loyees’ Old-Age Benefits Institution chairman apprised the meeting of the institution’s mandate, functions, and role in providing social protection to workers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two sides also exp­lored avenues for enhancing bilateral cooperation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later, the minister for overseas Pakistanis also met secretary of the Department of Migrant Workers of the Philippines, Hans Leo J. Cacdac. At the meeting, the EOBI chairman briefed the participants on Pakistan’s social security framework, including eligibility criteria, benefit structures and disbursement mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif believes Pakistan’s boycott of the India match at the T20 World Cup is a calculated move aimed squarely at the ICC’s financial and governance structure. Linking the decision to Bangladesh’s removal from the tournament, Latif argues this is not an emotional reaction but a strategic play that could reshape world cricket negotiations.</description>

      <title>Farhan keeps faith as Pakistan face India in must-win clash</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970279/farhan-keeps-faith-as-pakistan-face-india-in-must-win-clash</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;BULAWAYO: Pakistan Under-19 team captain Farhan Yousaf said his side were confident of putting a strong performance as they gear up to face arch-rivals India in a must-win Super Six fixture of the ICC Under-19 World Cup on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan need to beat India by a big margin to pip their rivals to a semi-final spot from Group 2 with table-toppers England having already sealed their berth. They head into the match having won the last match between the two sides in the Under-19 Asia Cup final in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India enter the clash unbeaten in the tournament, having swept past Bangladesh and New Zealand in the group stage before easing past Zimbabwe in the Super Six. With three wins and a commanding net run rate of +3.337, five-time champions India sit second the group with six points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan are third, two points behind. They lost to England but beat Zimbabwe in the group stage before securing an eight-wicket victory over New Zealand in the Super Six. Their net run rate might be +1.484 but Farhan is unfazed by the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The morale of the squad is very high,” Farhan said. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Not only for this match, but over the last few games as well, the players have shown great intensity and we are confident of putting in a strong performance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opener Sameer Minhas, whose whirlwind knock in the Asia Cup final made the difference, echoed similar views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The environment in the squad is very positive,” he said. “The team has been performing well in recent matches and we are looking to carry the momentum forward and take confidence into the next game.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only action at the tournament on Saturday was a dead rubber Group 2 match between Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in Harare which the former won by 74 runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh rode on Azizul Hakim Tamim’s anchoring knock of 59 to post 253-9 before pacer Iqbal Hossain’s 5-24 saw them skittle out the hosts for 179.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The BCB has introduced strict entry rules for journalists at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium due to increased security measures amid controversy over Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup participation. Media must use Gate 1 and can enter only on match days, press events, or approved sessions. The move follows the ICC’s decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland for the 2026 T20 World Cup starting February 7.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As the &lt;a href=&quot;https://yawmle.clicks.mlsend.com/tl/cl/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjU4NTIxOCxcImxcIjoxNzgwNjI5Mjc5OTQwMjkzNDIsXCJyXCI6MTc4MDYyOTQxMTA5NjE3ODExfSIsInMiOiI0YzgyN2FkYjQ4MDY0ZGMwIn0&quot;&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt; notes, isolated national actions are insufficient when pollution itself ignores borders. India, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Pakistan share the same airshed. Without cooperation, each country keeps breathing its neighbour’s mistakes. “As the government representing the largest population affected by air pollution, India should lead this effort. Instead, the region has drifted away from cooperation, and the cost has been catastrophic,” Dr Subedee said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Hindu minorities in Bangladesh are reportedly facing targeted violence. The Rights &amp;amp; Risks Analysis Group states that houses and temples are being burned, and individuals murdered. The report details specific incidents and victims. Bangladeshi authorities have dismissed a religious motive for these attacks. This denial, according to the report, emboldens fundamentalists. Victims often fear reprisal.</description>

&lt;p&gt;As orders for the JF-17 multirole jet fighter platform grow, Islamabad is finding that military partnerships are no longer easily compartmentalised.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources with intimate knowledge of Pakistan’s arms export practices claim that Islamabad will seek to avoid arms sales in regions of contested sovereignty, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/sudan&quot;&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/libya&quot;&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;, where a United Nations embargo is in place. That would include indirect exports via Saudi Arabia or the UAE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several Pakistani sources with ties to the military and intelligence establishment note that should Islamabad be forced to take a position, it would err on the side of Riyadh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Reuters &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pakistan-seals-4bn-arms-deal-sell-chinese-warplanes-libyas-khalifa-haftar-report&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from late December indicates that Pakistan and the Libyan National Army (LNA) have negotiated a multi-billion-dollar defence package, including JF-17 fighter jets and Super Mushshak trainers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report points to a $4bn agreement between Pakistan’s Field Marshal Asim Munir and Saddam Haftar, the deputy commander-in-chief of the Benghazi-based LNA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The LNA has long relied on external patrons, and any large-scale procurement would require third-party financial backing. Analysts frequently indicate that backing is linked to the UAE’s established support for Haftar’s de facto-controlled territories and a Pakistani source with ties to Gulf security circles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another January &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pakistan-verge-sealing-15bn-deal-provide-weapons-and-jets-sudan&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from Reuters said Pakistan was on the verge of an arms deal with Sudan, which some have speculated could be tied to Saudi Arabia offering Pakistan the opportunity to convert $2bn in loans in exchange for a squadron of JF-17, and additional commitments to the tune of $2bn.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Sudan was reportedly negotiated by Pakistan’s chief of the air staff, Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, and Lieutenant General Turki bin Bander bin Abdulaziz of the Royal Saudi Air Force.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why the JF-17?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JF-17 Thunder is usually branded as a joint venture between Pakistan’s Aeronautical Complex and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation, and marketed as a low-cost multirole fighter with beyond-visual-range capability.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s JF-17 platform is pursuing further sinification. As Chinese sub-systems are battle-tested, their value is multiplied, while Beijing builds doctrinal experience against Nato platforms (the F-16, Rafale, and Eurofighter) without being exposed to conflict.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The limited war between &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/libya&quot;&gt;India&lt;/a&gt; and Pakistan in May 2025 is said to have bolstered the value proposition of the JF-17 platform, cementing a strategic symbiosis for the benefit of both Beijing and Islamabad.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Why Pakistan&apos;s war with India led to a boom in arms sales and defence ties&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/why-pakistans-war-india-led-boon-arms-sales-and-defence-ties&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Estimated unit costs vary widely depending on configuration and support packages. The platform’s affordability relative to western fighters such as the F-16 Block 70, Rafale, or Eurofighter Typhoon continues to drive interest among states seeking modern capability without the political constraints of western suppliers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Various sources suggest each JF-17 unit costs in the $25-42m range, depending on the variant and customisation requirements of the client. This compares to $70-100m for an F-16 Block 70 Viper and $90-130m for a Dassault Rafale or a Eurofighter Typhoon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the single-engine JF-17 has a longer range and runs at a fraction of the cost of either the American or the French platform.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cost factor is significant for a range of buyers in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. There are, however, questions of industrial capacity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Pakistan’s expanding order pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has confirmed exports of the JF-17 to Myanmar and Nigeria, and a confirmed export order to Azerbaijan, with initial deliveries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prolonged negotiations with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt&quot;&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iraq&quot;&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt; seem to have failed, mostly due to an unreliable financing framework. There are prospective and more promising negotiations with Indonesia and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/bangladesh&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia is not looking to acquire JF-17s for domestic use but rather for Sudan. Reuters reports that Riyadh is looking to supply the Sudanese government of Abdel Fattah al-Burhan against the Emirati-backed Rapid Support Forces (RSF) forces, led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, also known as Hemedti.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haftar continues to be the arms conduit of UAE weapons shipments to the RSF, Middle East Eye has previously &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-weapons-flow-rsf-libya-continue-despite-pressure-haftar&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;, despite Egyptian and Saudi pressure towards Benghazi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2025, RSF forces captured the tri-border area (Sudan, Egypt, and Libya), easing the way for the export of artisanal gold from Sudan and the import of ammunition via Libya.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the Haftar government in Benghazi could use the jet fighters as a coercive tool against the UN-recognised and Turkish-backed Tripoli government, they can also be used to back RSF forces in the tri-border region.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources with intimate knowledge of the Pakistani military complex suggest the Haftar deal is founded on the assumption of Emirati financing. This fits Benghazi’s broader role as a logistics conduit for RSF forces.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Riyadh’s effective veto&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan historically maintains amicable relations with all Gulf Cooperation Council countries, with military ties spearheading those relationships. Pakistan has been training Saudi pilots since 1967, a relationship Islamabad cultivated across the Arab world (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/syria&quot;&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/qatar&quot;&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;, UAE, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/jordan&quot;&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/bahrain&quot;&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/yemen&quot;&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, and Libya).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commitment and compartmentalisation are key in these relationships.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan has successfully navigated murky waters in the Gulf, staying out of the Yemeni conflict in 2015 while allowing Doha to use ports and air corridors during the blockade: now, as before, there is confidence that the Pakistani military will avoid getting stuck between the two,” Kamal Amal, a fellow with the Atlantic Council, told Middle East Eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-advanced-talks-join-saudi-arabia-and-pakistan-defence-pact-report&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;alt&quot; class=&quot;mee-readmore-image&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Pakistan-Saudi-Arabia-leaders-AFP.jpg.webp?itok=YVd7WU5q&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, both industrial logic and diplomatic realities suggest that, should Pakistan be pressed, Islamabad would lean towards Riyadh.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many orders mean selective delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, Pakistan’s Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman signed a “strategic mutual defence agreement” in September 2025, signalling a new chapter of greater volume and far-reaching defence cooperation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, Pakistan is unlikely to go head-to-head against the Tripoli government, backed by Ankara. Pakistan, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, and Azerbaijan form the so-called &quot;Three Brothers Alliance&quot;, a multi-layered partnership with a strong security dimension.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkey is a close military-industrial partner to both Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, politics in action is the prioritisation of deliveries when the order book is congested. These priorities need to balance between Pakistan’s priorities and the consent of strategic suppliers, including China and Turkey.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JF-17 Thunder is a joint programme between China and Pakistan. The platform has a range of strategic systems that are Chinese-made, including the KLJ-7A AESA system, Smart-HUD holographic display, and carries a PL-10 and PL-15 Chinese air-to-air missiles payload. Without Chinese strategic cooperation, the platform is not deliverable.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://defencesecurityasia.com/en/russia-rd93-engine-pakistan-benefit-india-airpower-analysis/&quot;&gt;weak link&lt;/a&gt; in the JF-17 supply chain is Russian. The JF-17 Block III engine is a Klimov RD-93 MA, and there are doubts as to whether Russia can or will support Pakistan’s surging order book or set a ceiling on the number of jet fighters Islamabad can reliably deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Pakistani source suggests there is a 25-frame limit a year, and any further scaling up of production would require considerable investment and a reliable supply chain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is talk of a shift towards a Chinese-made Guizhou &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/china/ws13.htm#:~:text=The%20WS13%20is%20a%20modified,not%20allowed%20without%20Moscow&apos;s%20permission&quot;&gt;WS-13 Taishan&lt;/a&gt;, such a dramatic shift would need testing and possibly battle validation before it becomes commercially attractive.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aircraft also carries a Turkish-made targeting pod, Aselpod, and can be customised to carry Gokdogan and Bozdogan air-to-air missiles. Azerbaijan’s order is likely to be customised with a greater role for Turkey in the supply chain.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Saudi Arabia key to Pakistan&apos;s export ambitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Russian element is industrially necessary but politically expendable. Turkey’s role is non-negotiable. Ankara and Islamabad are close partners in Turkey’s 5th Generation Kaan programme, UAVs, and maritime platforms, with a view to joint exports to third countries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Saudi kingdom is a major client for the Kaan, and Ankara is a strategic partner in Riyadh’s localisation drive, as the kingdom aims to locally produce 50 percent of its procurement needs by 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In effect, if not in principle, the Saudi and Turkish realities make Pakistan’s military-industrial priorities clear.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pakistani order book is mounting, but can only advance to delivery with Chinese and Turkish support. Pakistan has to upgrade approximately 50 Block II units to Block III and deliver 40 jets to Baku.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reported agreements with Libya, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq for dozens of jets are precariously founded on poor financial guarantees, with the added cost of international embargoes. In effect, these cannot be a priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Negotiations with Bangladesh and Indonesia would require major investment in capacity and are more likely to lay the foundations for the dependable revenue needed for industrial investment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is likely to avoid prioritising the delivery of JF-17s to war zones under a UN embargo, such as Sudan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, there is no surplus of jet fighters, and the pipeline is congested. Secondly, because Islamabad likes to maintain an equal distance between its partners in the Gulf and cannot be seen as supplying both sides of the Sudanese proxy war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, states with contested sovereignty are not good clients for platforms that require multi-annual cooperation, including training, localised expertise, and reliable funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If pressure mounts for delivery, deeper diplomatic ties with the Saudi kingdom and Turkey&apos;s strategic priorities point to prioritising Riyadh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospects of Islamabad delivering on its Libyan deal are dim, but this might be the first and perhaps the easiest of dilemmas for the Turkish-Pakistani military industrial complex in the Gulf, given the polarisation between Riyadh and Abu Dhabi.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WHO sees low risk of Nipah virus spreading beyond India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969886/who-sees-low-risk-of-nipah-virus-spreading-beyond-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a low risk of the deadly Nipah virus spreading from India, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said on Friday, adding that it did not recommend travel or trade curbs after two infections were reported by the South Asian nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969545&quot;&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam are among the Asian locations that tightened airport screening checks this week to guard against such a spread after India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969509&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; infections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The WHO considers the risk of further spread of infection from these two cases is low,” the agency told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; in an email on Friday, adding that India had the capacity to contain such outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no evidence yet of increased human-to-human transmission,” it said, adding that it has coordinated with Indian health authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it did not rule out further exposure to the virus, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969548&quot;&gt;circulates&lt;/a&gt; in the bat population in parts of India and neighbouring Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carried by fruit bats and animals such as pigs, the virus can cause fever and brain inflammation. It has a fatality rate ranging from 40 per cent to 75pc, with no cure, though vaccines in development are still being tested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It spreads to humans from infected bats, or fruit they contaminate, but person-to-person transmission is not easy as it typically requires prolonged contact with those infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small outbreaks are not unusual and virologists say the risk to the general population remains low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source of infection was not yet fully understood, said the WHO. It classifies Nipah as a priority pathogen because of a lack of licensed vaccines or treatments, a high fatality rate, and a fear it could mutate into a more transmissible variant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two health workers infected in India’s eastern state of West Bengal late in December are being treated in hospital, local authorities have said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India regularly reports sporadic Nipah infections, particularly in its southern state of Kerala, regarded as one of the world’s highest-risk regions for the virus, linked to dozens of deaths since it first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1410656&quot;&gt;emerged&lt;/a&gt; there in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outbreak is the seventh documented in India and the third in West Bengal, where outbreaks in 2001 and 2007 were in districts bordering Bangladesh, which reports outbreaks almost annually, the WHO said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif has withdrawn his call for a full T20 World Cup boycott, stating the opportune moment has passed. He now suggests Pakistan could refuse to play India, a decision he insists must come from the government. Latif believes a boycott now would lack impact after Bangladesh&apos;s exclusion.</description>

      <title>Amid uncertainty over Pakistan’s T20 World Cup participation, Iceland quips it is ‘unavailable’ to replace Green Shirts</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969737/amid-uncertainty-over-pakistans-t20-world-cup-participation-iceland-quips-it-is-unavailable-to-replace-green-shirts</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amid uncertainty about Pakistan’s participation in the upcoming T20 World Cup, Iceland has quipped that its team is unavailable to replace the Green Shirts in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969326&quot;&gt;expected &lt;/a&gt;to make a final decision by next week, over the cricket team’s participation in next month’s Twenty20 World Cup, keeping open the possibility of a boycott over Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;withdrawal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the uncertainty, Iceland Cricket had earlier quipped that it needed Pakistan to decide on its participation soon, saying they were “ready to take off”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that Iceland is not a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/members/europe&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;member &lt;/a&gt;of the International Cricket Council.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, on Thursday, Iceland Cricket’s X account — known for its wisecracks — said: “It is with a heavy heart that we now announce our unavailability to replace Pakistan in the upcoming T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regardless of whether they [Pakistan] now withdraw, the short timescales ensure it is impossible for our squad to prepare in the professional manner necessary to compete effectively in this global cricketing spectacle,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;ICC’s decision&lt;/a&gt; to replace Bangladesh with Scotland, upon the former’s refusal to travel to India, it said, “We are not like Scotland and able to turn up on a whim, with no kit sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our players are from all walks of life and cannot simply drop their occupations to fly halfway around the world to experience temperatures only normally felt in Finnish saunas,” the post said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our captain, a professional baker, needs to attend to his oven, our ship captain needs to steer his vessel, and our bankers need to go bankrupt (again),” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the harsh reality of cricket at the amateur level of the game. This news will be extremely disappointing to our fans,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were ready to give the Dutch the biggest shock they have experienced since William of Orange lost the Battle of Landen in 1693. And the Americans were looking forward to taking on Greenland, or so their orange-dyed leader thought,” the post added, taking a crack at US President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our loss is likely Uganda’s gain. We wish them well. Their kits cannot be missed unless you have epilepsy, in which case they are probably best avoided,” it concluded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh-Pakistan flights resume after 14 years</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969741/bangladesh-pakistan-flights-resume-after-14-years</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a 14-year hiatus, the first direct flight between Pakistan and Bangladesh landed at Jinnah International Airport on Thursday night, as Biman Bangladesh Airlines completed its inaugural flight from Dhaka to Karachi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said that the Bangladeshi carrier returned to Karachi after 14 years and was given a traditional water cannon salute upon landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authority hailed the flight as “a new chapter” in the relationship between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.flightradar24.com/data/aircraft/s2-aho&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Data &lt;/a&gt;from FlightRadar24 showed Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight BG341 landed in Karachi at 11:03pm, having departed Dhaka at 8:15pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori spoke to the press at the airport, stating that cooperation with Bangladesh would not be limited to aviation but would extend to other sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I absolutely want to say that today, after several years, the conspiracies have died,” Tessori said, holding India responsible for “driving a wedge” between the people of Pakistan and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further said that India was responsible for terrorism in Pakistan and was also “conspiring against Bangladesh”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I congratulate the people of Bangladesh, for they have not only defeated the Indian conspiracies but also exposed them,” he said. The governor added that India had been unfair to Bangladesh in cricket as well, saying it was “out in the open”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The love between Pakistan and Bangladesh will grow because I know that the Bangladeshi people love Pakistanis,” Tessori stated. “This love will transform through trade and cooperation, and we will fight these Indian extremists together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Pakistan’s High Commission in Dhaka had released a statement, saying that the “fully packed” inaugural flight had departed from Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport, Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The flight was seen off by Bangladesh Civil Aviation and Tourism Adviser Sheikh Bashiruddin, High Commissioner of Pakistan to Bangladesh Imran Haider and other officials, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The resumption of direct flight after a hiatus of 14 years marks a significant milestone in strengthening connectivity and bilateral engagement,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/PakinBangladesh/status/2016903341205500333?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Bangladesh’s adviser for civil aviation and tourism underscored the importance of the Dhaka–Karachi route in “enhancing connectivity, promoting tourism and strengthening people-to-people links”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement quoted him as saying, “Bangladesh Airlines will gradually increase flight frequency and reduce airfares to make travel more affordable for the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed hope that people of Bangladesh will visit Pakistan and explore its natural beauty, cultural heritage and diverse cuisines, it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the ceremony, Pakistan’s high commissioner recalled the vision of Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh’s interim leader, and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif “aimed at enhancing connectivity between Pakistan and Bangladesh”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In view of the vision of the leadership and aspirations of the people of our two countries, during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1936871&quot;&gt;visit of the Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar to Dhaka&lt;/a&gt; in August last year, both sides agreed to take immediate measures for the resumption of direct flights,” the statement quoted him as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also expressed gratitude to the government of Bangladesh, Biman Bangladesh Airlines, and the Civil Aviation Authority for making the launch of the flight possible, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Passengers travelling on the inaugural flight expressed happiness and enthusiasm over the restoration of the direct air link, describing it as a milestone towards bringing the two countries closer,” the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965805&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that both countries would resume direct flight operations after a 14-year hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Amid uncertainty over Pakistan’s T20 World Cup participation, Iceland quips it is unavailable to replace Green Shirts</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969737/amid-uncertainty-over-pakistans-t20-world-cup-participation-iceland-quips-it-is-unavailable-to-replace-green-shirts</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Amid uncertainty about Pakistan’s participation in the upcoming T20 World Cup, Iceland has quipped that its team is unavailable to replace the Green Shirts in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969326&quot;&gt;expected &lt;/a&gt;to make a final decision by next week, over the cricket team’s participation in next month’s Twenty20 World Cup, keeping open the possibility of a boycott over Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;withdrawal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the uncertainty, Iceland Cricket had earlier quipped that it needed Pakistan to decide on its participation soon, saying they were “ready to take off”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that Iceland is not a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/about/members/europe&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;member &lt;/a&gt;of the International Cricket Council.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Howeve, on Thursday, Iceland Cricket’s X account — known for its wisecracks — said: “It is with a heavy heart that we now announce our unavailability to replace Pakistan in the upcoming T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Regardless of whether [Pakistan] they now withdraw, the short timescales ensure it is impossible for our squad to prepare in the professional manner necessary to compete effectively in this global cricketing spectacle,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;ICC’s decision&lt;/a&gt; to replace Bangladesh with Scotland, upon their refusal to travel to India, it said, “We are not like Scotland and able to turn up on a whim, with no kit sponsor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our players are from all walks of life and cannot simply drop their occupations to fly halfway around the world to experience temperatures only normally felt in Finnish saunas,” the post said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our captain, a professional baker, needs to attend to his oven, our ship captain needs to steer his vessel, and our bankers need to go bankrupt (again). This is the harsh reality of cricket at the amateur level of the game,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is the harsh reality of cricket at the amateur level of the game. This news will be extremely disappointing to our fans,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were ready to give the Dutch the biggest shock they have experienced since William of Orange lost the Battle of Landen in 1693. And the Americans were looking forward to taking on Greenland, or so their orange-dyed leader thought,” the post added, taking a crack at US President Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our loss is likely Uganda’s gain. We wish them well. Their kits cannot be missed unless you have epilepsy, in which case they are probably best avoided,” it concluded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s February Referendum and the Future of Secularism</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, though Muslim‑majority, has historically significant Hindu, Buddhist, Christian, and Indigenous minorities. Removing secularism would create a profound democratic dilemma as it is the safeguard against majoritarian dominance and structural exclusion. The South Asian experience shows the risks of privileging religion in constitutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Pakistan&apos;s participation in the T20 World Cup 2026 is uncertain. The Pakistan Cricket Board may withdraw in protest of Bangladesh&apos;s exclusion.  The ICC has warned Pakistan of severe disciplinary actions if they fail to participate.  Former Indian captain Ajinkya Rahane expressed skepticism about Pakistan&apos;s boycott threat.  The final decision rests with the Pakistani government.</description>

      <title>Measuring early child development key to ‘lifelong health’, experts say</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969660/measuring-early-child-development-key-to-lifelong-health-experts-say</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Health researchers on Wednesday demonstrated a World Health Organisation-developed digital tool to assess early childhood brain development, which has been adapted into local languages (Urdu and Sindhi) and integrated into provincial systems, amid concerns over the cost and inaccessibility of existing assessment methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool, known as the Global Scales for Early Development (GSED), was &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news/item/27-02-2023-who-rolls-out-new-holistic-way-to-measure-early-childhood-development&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;originally designed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by WHO to measure cognitive, socio-emotional, language and motor skills in children from birth to 36 months of age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GSED measures were extensively field-tested and validated in three countries (Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Tanzania) before the first full version of the tool was launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At an event held at Karachi’s Aga Khan University, attended by researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders, experts highlighted that the lack of reliable and comparable data has made it difficult for governments to prioritise early childhood development and to track progress on Sustainable Development Goal indicator 4.2.1, which measures whether children are developmentally on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What we do not measure, we struggle to prioritise and often fail to act on,” said Dr Imran Nisar, associate professor in paediatrics and child health, while outlining the rationale behind the tool and its validation in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to WHO estimates shared during the seminar, more than &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.unicef.org/pakistan/early-childhood-development-ecd-0&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;250 million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; children globally are at risk of not reaching their developmental potential.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, the figure stands at 54 per cent, or about &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://pc.gov.pk/web/press/get_press/1670&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;33 million&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; children, WHO representative Ellen Thom said, adding that early childhood development is a global priority, “essential not only for child survival, but also for lifelong health, learning and well-being”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Salim Virani, vice provost for global research at AKU, said early childhood should be viewed as a foundation rather than a “warm-up” for later life, arguing that interventions in the first few years have long-term social and economic returns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also urged policymakers to integrate development measurement into existing public health surveys, including nutrition assessments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we invest in early childhood, the dividends are magnified,” Dr Virani said. “I’m a cardiologist. We know that addressing a risk factor early, rather than at 30, 40, or 50, doesn’t just give additive benefits; it’s multiplicative. You follow a completely different curve when you start early. It’s the same for human development,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to WHO’s Dr Vanessa Cavallera, one reason early childhood development has remained under-measured is the absence of tools that are feasible, affordable and culturally adaptable for low- and middle-income countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GSED, she said, was developed using data from more than 70,000 children across 31 countries and is designed for programmatic-level and population-level evaluations. Dr Cavallera also linked brain development in the first 1,000 days of life to later health, learning and productivity outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking via a recorded message, Sindh Parliamentary Secretary for Health Nida Khuhro said reliable and standardised data was essential for policy planning and investment. “When adapted into local languages and integrated into provincial systems, no child is left invisible,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Seema Lasi, assistant professor at AKU’s human development programme, explained that childhood development in Pakistan is often discussed only in terms of nutrition, which can be measured through a child’s weight and height, while brain development remains harder to assess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Brain development is not always visible or obvious,” she told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, explaining that it requires structured interaction with children or their caregivers, often through specific questions, to understand whether development is on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the first five years of a child’s life are critical for both mental and physical growth, noting that &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.unicef.org/turkiye/en/stories/10-facts-about-early-childhood-development-you-need-know&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;around 80pc&lt;/a&gt; of brain development is completed by the age of three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new assessment tool allows health professionals to identify developmental delays and respond early. “If development is happening as it should, that is a good sign. If not, then it shows us where intervention is needed,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Lasi clarified that the tool is currently intended for population-level surveys rather than individual diagnosis. “For now, it will be used in national and population-based surveys. In the future, it may also be used for screening or diagnosing individual children,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s cricket boycott exposes deepening cracks in South Asian diplomacy</title>

      <description>Bangladesh’s recent pull-out over perceived security concerns for the showpiece T20 World Cup cricket hosted by India and Sri Lanka next month has underscored the unprecedented way regional political tensions have spilled over into sports.
Bangladesh was replaced by Scotland in the 20-team event on Saturday after the International Cricket Council rejected Dhaka’s request to move its matches to Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start.

      <title>Sri Lanka boosts T20 World Cup security with eye on India-Pakistan matches</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969712/sri-lanka-boosts-t20-world-cup-security-with-eye-on-india-pakistan-matches</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka will deploy elite armed units to protect teams at next month’s T20 World Cup, part of enhanced security measures with a special emphasis on matches between perennial rivals India and Pakistan, officials have told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island is co-hosting the biennial cricket tournament with India and will hold 20 games between February 7 and March 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian and Pakistani teams will play each other at least once, in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957298&quot;&gt;Group A clash&lt;/a&gt; in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket matches have long been a stage for expressing political tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours, which fought a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509&quot;&gt;four-day conflict&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka has given the “highest priority” to ensuring the tournament runs smoothly and is “paying special attention to the India-Pakistan matches”, sports minister Sunil Kumara Gamage told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elite commando units, usually assigned to guard visiting heads of state, will be deployed to protect all participating teams, police and security officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From the time they step out of the airport till they return to their aircraft, they will be protected by armed guards,” an official said, asking not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India and Pakistan have previously refused to travel across the border for sporting events, opting to play on neutral ground via a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;hybrid model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; instead. Hence, for the T20 World Cup, the International Cricket Council (ICC) has shifted their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;also tried&lt;/a&gt; to have their matches moved out of India due to security fears, but the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An angry Bangladesh then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;withdrew&lt;/a&gt; from the tournament, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;Scotland were drafted in&lt;/a&gt; as their replacement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has indicated that it may yet boycott the event in solidarity with Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka maintained a studious silence throughout the India-Bangladesh row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket Secretary Bandula Dissanayake told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; Colombo wanted to avoid being drawn into regional disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In these disputes among India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, we are remaining neutral, all of these are friendly nations,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he added that Sri Lanka would be willing to host future tournaments for any of the countries if asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka has also used the T20 World Cup as an opportunity to upgrade its international venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has commissioned new floodlights at the Singhalese Sports Club, one of two stadiums in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pallekele Stadium in Kandy was unaffected by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958318/floods-hit-sri-lankas-capital-colombo-as-cyclone-ditwah-death-toll-rises-to-159&quot;&gt;deadly cyclone&lt;/a&gt; that damaged buildings in the region in November, and will host a T20 international between Sri Lanka and England from Friday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>UK universities becoming more reliant on Chinese students: FT</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969647/uk-universities-becoming-more-reliant-on-chinese-students-ft</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LONDON: Leading British universities are becoming more reliant on students from China for overseas enrolments, triggering concerns about financial risk and academic independence as global competition for international students intensifies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/9db6f60d-2229-4cbd-985c-72e789a453d2&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; cites new data which shows that Chinese nationals made up more than two-fifths of international students at the UK’s elite Russell Group universities in the 2024/25 academic year. Around 105,000 Chinese students were enrolled at these institutions, accounting for 42.5 per cent of their total overseas intake, which is the highest proportion on record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, Chinese students represented less than 9pc of international enrolments across the rest of the UK’s higher education sector, highlighting how heavily top-ranked universities depend on a single source country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figures come at a time when British universities are under mounting financial strain, driven by falling domestic funding and tighter immigration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955755/uk-toughens-asylum-rules-amid-rise-of-anti-immigrant-reform-party&quot;&gt;rules&lt;/a&gt; that have slowed recruitment from several key markets. Sector leaders have warned that over reliance on China exposes universities to geopolitical, economic and diplomatic shocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;105,000 students from China enrolled in elite Russell Group universities in 2024-25 academic year, says report&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerns about Beijing’s influence on UK campuses have also resurfaced. In recent months, British academics have cited instances of pressure and intimidation linked to research on sensitive issues such as alleged human rights violations in China’s Xinjiang region. Critics argue that universities’ dependence on Chinese tuition fees may encourage self-censorship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK Department for Education said any form of foreign interference or intimidation would not be tolerated and stressed that steps were being taken to strengthen the sector’s financial resilience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efforts to diversify recruitment have been complicated by recent policy changes. Universities have reduced intake from countries such as Pakistan and Bangladesh following stricter visa rules while favouring markets with higher visa compliance rates, including China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data also shows that overall international student numbers in the UK have declined for the second consecutive year, falling by more than 5pc in 2024–25. Enrolments dropped in three of the four largest source countries — India, China and Nigeria — with Nigeria seeing particularly sharp falls following its currency crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan was the only major source country to record growth, with new student numbers rising by about 5pc. Nepal also saw a sharp increase, nearly doubling its student population in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, Russell Group universities reported a fall in total international enrolments, meaning their dependence on Chinese students has grown even as absolute numbers decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sector representatives have warned that upcoming changes to the UK’s immigration system and a proposed levy on international students due to be introduced in 2028 could further undermine competitiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Universities are instead being encouraged to expand overseas. Last year, nine leading UK institutions received approval to open campuses in India, reflecting a broader shift towards transnational education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials say the UK remains committed to attracting international students sustainably but university leaders continue to call for long-term funding reforms to reduce dependence on overseas fee income.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan orders screening of travellers in view of Nipah virus threat</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969545/pakistan-orders-screening-of-travellers-in-view-of-nipah-virus-threat</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday decided to enforce “strict and enhanced health surveillance” at all entry points in the country with immediate effect in order to prevent the cross-border transmission of Nipah virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nipah, carried by fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can trigger a deadly brain-swelling fever in humans and can also spread directly from person to person through close contact. Several vaccines are in development but remain in testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organisation (WHO) because of its ability to spark fast‑moving outbreaks, its fatality rate of 40 per cent to 75pc, and the fact that there is no approved vaccine or cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measures taken by authorities in Pakistan coincide with those taken multiple other countries — Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia — after India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969509&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the detection of two cases in December last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this connection, the Border Health Services-Pakistan (BHS-P) — an ancillary department of the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination — issued an advisory which referred to a regional alert reported by international and regional public health surveillance mechanisms, including the WHO&lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789290222293&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; South East Asia Region Epidemiological Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing the alert, the advisory said in view of the “suspected cases of Nipah virus infection in West Bengal, India, and considering the high case fatality rate, zoonotic nature, and potential for human-to-human transmission, it has become imperative to further strengthen preventive and surveillance measures at Pakistan’s borders”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In order to prevent the cross-border transmission of Nipah virus in Pakistan and to ensure early detection and prompt response, the competent authority has decided to enforce strict and enhanced health surveillance at all points of entry with immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These instructions shall be applicable to all points of entry, including international airports, seaports, and ground/ land border crossings, without any exception,” the advisory said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlining the instructions, the advisory said all in-charges at entry points should ensure 100pc screening of all arriving passengers, transit passengers, crew members, drivers, helpers, and support staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No individual shall be allowed entry into Pakistan without health clearance by BHS-P,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new measures, mandatory verification of the country of origin and complete travel and transit history for the preceding 21 days shall be carried out for each and every traveller, irrespective of their nationality or travel status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All in-charges at points of entry shall exercise special vigilance for travellers originating from, or transiting through, Nipah-affected or high-risk regions. Any false declaration, concealment, or misreporting of travel history shall be immediately documented and reported to the competent authorities for further necessary action,” the advisory stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, travellers are also required to undergo thermal screening and clinical assessment at entry points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Screening staff shall remain alert for early signs and symptoms of Nipah virus infection, including fever, headache, respiratory symptoms and neurological signs such as confusion, drowsiness or altered consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any individual consistent with suspected Nipah virus case definition shall be immediately isolated at the point of entry, restricted from onward movement, and managed strictly in accordance with infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols,” it was instructed in the advisory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such suspected cases should be promptly referred to the designated isolation facility or a tertiary care hospital in coordination with provincial and district health authorities, the advisory said, adding that the “conveyance concerned (aircraft, vessel, vehicle) and surrounding area shall be immediately disinfected as per approved standard operating procedures”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-charges at entry points have been further directed to ensure strict compliance with IPC measures, including the mandatory use of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene, and environmental sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any lapse in surveillance or IPC practices should be treated as serious negligence, the advisory said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, “daily case/ nil reports from all points of entry shall be recorded in the BHS-P system already in vogue and shared with National Command and Operation Centre and the National International Health Regulation Focal Point”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any delay, weak surveillance, under-reporting, or non-compliance with these instructions should not be tolerated, the advisory stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All in-charges at points of entry are directed to ensure strict compliance with the above instructions in letter and spirit. These measures shall remain in force until further orders are issued by the competent authority,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the National Institute of Health (NIH) also issued an alert to health departments, healthcare providers, and BHS-P regarding the potential threat of Nipah virus spillover into Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alert said that while Pakistan had not yet reported a human case, a significant situation was emerging in South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As of January 2026, an outbreak has been confirmed in West Bengal, India. […] Due to its high case fatality rate ranging from 40pc to 75pc and the potential for human-to-human transmission, health authorities are placing the region on high alert,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the advisory, there was currently no specific anti-viral treatment or licensed vaccine available for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management remains primarily supportive and focuses on symptomatic treatment, including management of fever, respiratory distress, and neurological complications,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Severely ill patients often require hospitalisation and may need intensive care support, including mechanical ventilation. The clinical effectiveness of ribavirin (broad-spectrum antiviral medication) remains inconclusive and it is not routinely recommended,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It urged travellers to avoid contact with symptomatic individuals or contaminated materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Travellers returning from affected areas within 21 days who develop symptoms should self-isolate, seek medical attention, and inform the provider of their travel history and exposure,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further directed the provincial health department to designate at least one tertiary-care hospital or infectious disease unit for the isolation and clinical management of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also urged provincial public laboratories to review and strengthen their capability for safe sample handling and transportation. Further, it directed that rapid response teams be placed on standby for case investigation, contact tracing, and coordinated field response for any cluster of acute encephalitis (brain inflammation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further said that provinces with international airports or land border points needed to main realtime communication with BHS-P for any alerts or travellers requiring follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#risk-in-pakistan-minimal&quot; id=&quot;risk-in-pakistan-minimal&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Risk in Pakistan minimal’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, Microbiologist Prof Dr Javaid Usman said that the virus was named after a place in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The virus is spread through the droppings of fruit bats and pigs,” he said. He further said that if cases were reported in Pakistan, it would be through carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Currently, a few cases have been reported in the Indian state of Bengal due to which neighbouring countries have announced to screen their masses,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replying to a question, he said that the major symptoms of the virus included fever and neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People can have fits. The virus can spread through respiratory droplets, saliva and the blood of a patient who has tested positive. So positive samples are kept in isolation,” Dr Usman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief of the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Dr Mumtaz Ali Khan, told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that this was the 51st outbreak since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although we have issued advisories to alert airport authorities, there are very few chances of identifying patients as the incubation period of the virus is 9 to 14 days,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease expert Dr Rana Safdar told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that Nipah virus was listed by the WHO as a priority pathogen due to a high fatality rate (up to 80pc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Its progression is therefore being closely monitored. While efforts are underway, to date no effective vaccine or treatment is available so the management of infected cases is largely supportive,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Safdar said, since its identification in 1998, the outbreaks of Nipah virus had been sporadically occurring in South and Southeast Asia, largely in rural settings. Countries which have previously reported outbreaks include Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Bangladesh and India, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the principle ‘infectious diseases respect no boundaries’, holds, due to the peculiar transmission dynamics, the risk of spread to surrounding countries thus far remains moderate to low. Given the current outbreak in India’s West Bengal and the associated media hype, there is no reason to panic as the risk of the virus in Pakistan stays minimal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While executing preventive measures, it’s important to consider that the usually deployed passenger screening at airports does not help much in preventing virus importation. We otherwise need to remain prepared, anticipating and mapping risk and enhancing vigilance in identified vulnerable zones,” Dr Safdar said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All you need to know about Nipah virus</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969548/all-you-need-to-know-about-nipah-virus</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two cases of the deadly Nipah virus in India have prompted countries in Asia to step up airport screening to prevent the spread of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is Nipah virus, and how worried should people be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#what-is-nipah-virus&quot; id=&quot;what-is-nipah-virus&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What is Nipah virus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nipah is a rare viral infection that spreads largely from infected animals, mainly fruit bats, to humans. It can be asymptomatic, but it is often very dangerous, with a case fatality rate of 40 to 75 per cent, depending on the local healthcare system’s capacity for detection and management, the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/nipah-virus&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;An undated image of fruit bats in Kerala, India. &amp;mdash; Reuters/File&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/28212852caac030.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;An undated image of fruit bats in Kerala, India. — Reuters/File&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while it can also spread from person to person, it does not do this easily, and outbreaks are usually small and fairly contained, according to experts and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate vaccines are under development, although none have been approved yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#how-common-is-it&quot; id=&quot;how-common-is-it&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How common is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nipah was first identified in Malaysia in 1999. Since then, there have been small outbreaks almost every year, mostly in Bangladesh. India also sees sporadic outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://cepi.net/nipah&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations&lt;/a&gt; (CEPI), a group that tracks emerging disease threats and funds the development of medical tools to protect against them, as of December, 750 cases had been recorded in all, and 415 of the patients died. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; traced the spread of Nipah in a 2023 series, Bat Lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#how-does-it-spread&quot; id=&quot;how-does-it-spread&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How does it spread?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When first identified in Malaysia, Nipah spread largely through direct contact with sick pigs or contaminated tissues. Since then, it more commonly spreads from contact with what scientists say is its natural host: fruit bats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the consumption of fruit or fruit products — like raw date palm juice — containing urine or saliva from infected fruit bats has been the most likely source of infection, the WHO says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human-to-human spread has been found, mainly after close contact between a sick patient and their family or caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#what-are-the-symptoms&quot; id=&quot;what-are-the-symptoms&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial symptoms of Nipah, such as fever, headaches and muscle pain, are not specific and can be confused with other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These can then be followed by neurological signs indicating acute encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and some people experience severe respiratory problems.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to a coma in days. Most people who get better make a full recovery, but some experience long-term neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#how-worried-should-we-be&quot; id=&quot;how-worried-should-we-be&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How worried should we be?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Nipah is a dangerous disease with a high fatality rate, it has not yet shown signs of becoming more transmissible among humans or spreading easily worldwide, scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it remains a significant public health concern, according to the WHO, particularly in countries where outbreaks are more common. It can also lead to the mass culling of farm animals such as pigs that are susceptible to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists say, however, that it is unlikely to spread globally and also point out that airport screening may be ineffective as the virus has a long incubation period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#what-vaccines-or-treatments-are-available&quot; id=&quot;what-vaccines-or-treatments-are-available&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What vaccines or treatments are available?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for Nipah, although several candidates are undergoing testing, including one developed by the Oxford University scientists involved in developing one of the Covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Australia provide benchmark test for Pakistan ahead of T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969539/australia-provide-benchmark-test-for-pakistan-ahead-of-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last year was supposed to be the one in which Pakistan were supposed to redefine their approach towards Twenty20 cricket. It didn’t come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the promises of more aggression with the bat and the subsequent change in personnel, the team scored at just 127.47 – more than a run (1.37 to be precise) slower than the year before. There was a record for the most wins in a calendar year — 21 — but 18 of those had come against lower-ranked or weaker sides in Bangladesh, West Indies, Afghanistan, Oman, UAE, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attempted reinvention — that brought in new captain and head coach — focused towards ensuring Pakistan’s T20 World Cup campaign this year does not look similar to 2024, when they were knocked out in just the group stage following embarrassing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1839304&quot;&gt;defeats&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1838302&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1838912/pakistan-squander-solid-start-as-india-claim-t20-thriller&quot;&gt;India.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some positives though. Pakistan look more settled as a team with the roles for each player well defined as the selectors and team management have persisted with the same core for the last 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was not the case in last year’s Champions Trophy when Pakistan, due to an injury to one player, rejigged their entire batting order, and before the 2024 edition of the T20 World Cup when two cricketers came out of retirement only to play that tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, who are accustomed to chaos, this is a good start. But, they face their sternest challenge when they come up against Australia — albeit in the familiar surroundings of Lahore — from Thursday in three T20Is. A series against a tough and ruthless opposition like Australia is not a bad way to get ready for a world event and it will help Salman Ali Agha in shaping his playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These games are very important because they will determine what will be our XI for the World Cup,” the Pakistan T20I captain told a press conference before his team’s final practice session ahead of the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are pretty much on track in regards to the direction we ventured upon a year ago. We have not had the conditions [in most series] to score 200 runs, but we scored 200 whenever we got them. We did so over here [at Gaddafi Stadium] against Bangladesh in almost every game. The team’s progress has been good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, there remain areas that need to be fine-tuned before Pakistan departs for Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since their T20I tri-series &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958160&quot;&gt;victory&lt;/a&gt; in November 2025, Pakistan have played only two matches in Sri Lanka and the last of them had to be curtailed because of the rain. Most of the Pakistan players had been playing in leagues around the world and the performances of the batters have not been satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub, Pakistan’s two openers, are coming off an underwhelming BPL and Fakhar Zaman failed to fire in the ILT20. Babar Azam had a torrid BBL in which he failed to put any score of note and his scoring rate remained under scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaheen Afridi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964122&quot;&gt;returns&lt;/a&gt; to competitive cricket after a knee injury curtailed his BBL stint with Brisbane Heat. Being the most senior pacer in the side, Shaheen will carry the weight of Pakistan’s four-man fast bowling contingent and his workload will be stretched in the absence of Haris Rauf as Pakistan will often return to him in the latter half of the opposition’s innings to stop the flow of runs in the death overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s recent successes have been engineered by their spin attack and the selectors had no qualms in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969045&quot;&gt;naming&lt;/a&gt; a spin-heavy contingent for the T20 World Cup, which they will play in spin-friendly conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ongoing T20 World Cup cycle (since the final of the 2024 T20 World Cup final), Pakistan spinners have taken 140 wickets in 44 matches at an average of 18.477 and have bowled at an economy rate of 6.94. Among the full-member teams, only India have taken more wickets (161) than them at an average of 15.68. But, India’s economy rate of 7.18 falls behind Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the stiff challenge that this Australian side poses will test each aspect of Pakistan’s game, which is the best possible preparation that a team can ask for before a world event. Pakistan have lost all their completed last seven T20Is against Australia, including the solitary game between these two sides on Pakistan soil (also at Gaddafi Stadium). They last&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1441544&quot;&gt; won&lt;/a&gt; a T20I against Australia back in October 2018 when Sarfaraz Ahmed was the captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia play the series without their frontline pace attack due to the injury-related&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967882&quot;&gt; absences&lt;/a&gt; of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle-order hard-hitter Tim David will also not play in this series because of hamstring woes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three will join the team in Sri Lanka ahead of their warm-up in Colombo. But, the squad that in land in Lahore in two batches – first in early afternoon and the second in late evening – contains most of those in Travis Head, captain Mitch Marsh, Cameron Green, Marcus Stoinis, and Adam Zampa, who have turned this side into a formidable unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia decided against holding practice before the first T20I as most of their players have had a camp in the UAE over the last four days and the others arrived straight from Australia after having played in the BBL finals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsh, who had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969530/australian-squad-arrives-in-lahore-for-t20i-series-ahead-of-icc-world-cup&quot;&gt;landed&lt;/a&gt; in Lahore just a few hours before the press conference, revealed that the final call on the team composition will be made when the squad sits together as a group later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you for having us,” Marsh said. “We’re very excited to be here. It’s a really important time in both teams’ preparation for the [T20] World Cup. Most of the squad has been in Dubai for the last four days training and getting together. Some of us have flown in a little bit later due to Big Bash commitments. But we’re ready to go and looking forward to a great series.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But would there be any acclimatisation issues with such a quick turnaround?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t pack too many jumpers,” Marsh said, “[I] wasn’t aware Pakistan got this cold.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Political movements do not become dangerous when they speak the language of faith; they become dangerous when they claim a monopoly over virtue. This observation, adapted from British philosopher Isaiah Berlin, has rarely been more relevant than in today’s Bangladesh.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;EDINBURGH: With new head coach Owen Dawkins at the helm, and under the captaincy of Richie Berrington, Scotland have named their squad for their seventh appearance at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh at the global showpiece being staged jointly by India and Sri Lanka from Feb 7 to March 8. Bangladesh refused to play their World Cup matches in India due to security concerns amid political tensions between New Delhi and Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European side had also participated in the inaugural edition of the tournament staged in 2007 in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zainullah Ihsan is a first-time call-up, with the Afghan-born fast bowler having recently qualified to play for Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan to host South Asian Games in March next year</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969422/pakistan-to-host-south-asian-games-in-march-next-year</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: The 14th edition of the South Asian Games will be held in Pakistan from March 23 to 31 next year, it was decided at a meeting of the South Asian Federations held in Tashkent the other day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Following detailed deliberations, the meeting unanimously decided that the South Asian Games shall be scheduled from March 23 to 31, 2027. The meeting further authorised the Pakistan Olympic Association / NOC Pakistan to make adjustments to the schedule within the same time window, with a flexibility of up to one week, as may be required for operational or logistical reasons,” read a press release issued by the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting in Uzbekistan capital was held on the sidelines of the 46th General Assembly of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At the outset of the meeting, the South Asian Olympic family extended its warm congratulations to Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani on his successful and unanimous election as President of the OCA,” added the press release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The meeting was chaired by HRH Prince Jigyel Ugyen Wangchuck, OCA Vice-President for South Asia, and was attended by the Presidents and/or Secretaries General of the National Olympic Committees of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s participation in the South Asian Games will depend on the stance of its government, which has avoided sending sporting teams to Pakistan over the past several years due to political tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Arif Saeed, President of the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) and the South Asia Olympic Council (SAOC), participated in the meeting along with Mohyuddin Ahmad Wani, Federal Secretary, Ministry of Sports, Government of Pakistan,” the press release further stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also agreed by all countries that the disciplines and events will remain the same as had already been finalised at the SAOC Executive Committee Meeting held in February last year in Lahore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the South Asian countries agreed to initiate further deliberations on developing a more sustainable and future-oriented model for sports in South Asia, with a focus on long-term regional cooperation and efficient delivery of multi-sport events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“During the meeting, Mohyuddin, extended an invitation to the South Asian countries to visit Pakistan in May 2026, with a view to continuing consultations, reviewing and monitoring the progress of preparations for the [2027] South Asian Games, and strengthening regional collaboration in sport,” the POA news release concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladesh polls: There are apprehensions that radicals will try to disrupt elections and deny the majority to BNP, pushing for a coalition government comprising Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI). The JeI has been emboldened following the outreach by the US and the UK. The US has allegedly tried to guide JeI to navigate the complicated politics of Bangladesh to consolidate its position.</description>

      <title>Myanmar ‘election’ shows the military regime is here to stay. How should the world respond?</title>

      <description>&lt;span&gt;Myanmar ‘election’ shows the military regime is here to stay. How should the world respond?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Expert comment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;LToremark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2026-01-27T16:54:00+00:00&quot; title=&quot;Tuesday, 27 January, 2026&quot;&gt;27 January 2026&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amid calls for the international community to ‘unequivocally reject’ the election results, only two real options remain: accept the status quo or engage with the military.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class=&quot;media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;img alt=&quot;A ballot paper is read out by a member of Myanmar&apos;s Union Election Commission at a polling station in downtown Yangon.&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2026-01/2026-01-27-myanmar-election-2253781614.jpg?itok=UHH76Bfs&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Five years after its military coup, Myanmar has a nominally civilian government. But the outcome of the general elections held on 25 January was never in doubt. Opposition parties were banned, voting did not take place in areas of the country affected by the ongoing civil war and there were widespread reports of coerced voting. As a result, we can be sure the military’s chosen front organization, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, won a landslide victory.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, has called on the international community to ’&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2026/01/illegitimate-elections-yield-illegitimate-results-un-expert-urges-rejection&quot;&gt;unequivocally reject&lt;/a&gt;’ the outcome. But is that the best way forward? Or is now the time to reassess relations with the military (‘Tatmadaw’ in Burmese)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;align-right embedded-entity embed&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media media-embed media-quote&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;media__wrapper&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;media__content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;svg class=&quot;icon icon--open-quote&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;
          &lt;use xlink:href=&quot;#icon-open-quote&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Virtue signalling displeasure is easy – but it is not going to improve lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation in Myanmar is dire. The civil war that erupted after the February 2021 military coup is in a stalemate. Ethnic armed organizations and anti-regime militias control around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bnionline.net/en/news/mass-killings-rise-across-myanmar-2025&quot;&gt;38 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of the country but are unable to capture the lowlands, the heartland of the military. The Tatmadaw, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnlm.com.mm/3rd-myanmar-russia-joint-anti-terrorism-committee-meeting-held-in-nay-pyi-taw/&quot;&gt;backed by Russian advisers&lt;/a&gt;, continues to launch deadly strikes into areas it does not control. Evidence indicates that the anti-regime forces are in retreat. In 2025, the Tatmadaw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bnionline.net/en/news/mass-killings-rise-across-myanmar-2025&quot;&gt;retook 26 of the bases and camps&lt;/a&gt; it had previously lost to the rebels and the number of armed clashes has fallen since its mid-2023 peak.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the conflict, Myanmar’s economy has collapsed, state control is disintegrating, and organized crime groups are exploiting the chaos. But despite the situation on the ground, there is little to no external pressure to end the conflict. None of Myanmar’s neighbours – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/asia-pacific/china&quot; title=&quot;China&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, India, Bangladesh, Laos or Thailand – want to see the military overthrown. All seem sanguine about the dangers emanating from the conflict, including irregular migration, illegal drug production, border insecurity and economic stagnation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2023, China supported a temporary alliance of ethnic organizations to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thinkchina.sg/society/chinas-all-out-effort-wipe-out-scam-syndicate-families-northern-myanmar&quot;&gt;destroy some Myanmar-based scam centres&lt;/a&gt; that had defrauded huge numbers of Chinese citizens. Once the operation was complete, however, it returned to favouring the status quo. And while the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed a ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/Chairmans-Statement-on-ALM-Five-Point-Consensus-24-April-2021-FINAL-a-1.pdf&quot;&gt;five-point consensus&lt;/a&gt;’ on the crisis in 2021, this has not prevented some of its 11 member states from operating rival policies towards Myanmar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many countries outside the region have condemned the coup, the Tatmadaw’s violence and the fraudulent elections, there is no sign of any of them taking serious action to improve the situation. The immediate question facing the wider world is how to respond to the results of an election that was clearly neither free nor fair. Virtue signalling displeasure is easy – but it is not going to improve lives. Given that the Tatmadaw-backed government enjoys the tacit support of its neighbours and continues to receive military backing from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/russia-and-eurasia/russia&quot; title=&quot;Russia: Current affairs and analysis&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, we can be reasonably confident that it is not about to collapse. The question is whether or not to engage it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been here before. This moment in Myanmar has parallels with the situation in 2008. The military leadership is seeking a fresh start and looking for international acceptance. Back then, the Tatmadaw introduced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Myanmar_2008&quot;&gt;new constitution&lt;/a&gt;, a major step in the process of undoing the previous military coup, in 1962. This constitution remains in force but is deeply flawed: it reserves a quarter of the seats in parliament for the military, for example. However, it does offer a roadmap towards peace, stability and even something approaching democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2026, outside powers have three options. One: they can tolerate the status quo with all its spiralling problems. Two: they can intervene to try to overthrow the military regime. Three: they can deal with the military regime in the hope of improving the situation for the people of Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little likelihood of regional support for option two, which leaves a choice between tolerating the status quo and engagement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;align-left embedded-entity embed&quot;&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        
      &lt;/header&gt;

                    
      
              
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst outcome would be a form of engagement that delivered international acceptance of continuing violence. Engagement must come with principles. Here, the ASEAN five-point consensus could be an important lever. It calls for an immediate cessation of violence; constructive dialogue among all parties concerned; an ASEAN special envoy to facilitate mediation of the dialogue; humanitarian assistance; and for the special envoy to visit Myanmar to meet all parties concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard to exaggerate the nationalist mindset of the Tatmadaw, characterized by paranoid fear of outside powers and ethnic separatism. The military would most probably use any ceasefire period to rebuild its forces with the ambition of eventually capturing areas currently controlled by ethnic armed groups and rebel militias. How can such an agenda be constrained?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The military wrote its long-term objectives into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myanmar-law-library.org/law-library/laws-and-regulations/constitutions/2008-constitution.html&quot;&gt;Article 6 of the 2008 constitution&lt;/a&gt;. They include ‘non-disintegration of the union’ – a nationalist demand to preserve the borders of the country – but also the ‘flourishing of a genuine, disciplined multi-party democratic system’ and ‘enhancing the eternal principles of justice, liberty and equality in the union’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Further spread of the Nipah virus remains possible due to insufficient understanding of the pathogen and the presence of a natural reservoir in South Asia, according to the World Health Organization.
WHO official representative in Geneva Tarik Jasarevic told RIA Novosti that the virus continues to pose a risk because it circulates among bat populations in certain regions of India and Bangladesh.
&quot;Further Nipah virus infections are possible, given the known Nipah virus reservoir in bat populations in parts of India and Bangladesh, including West Bengal,”</description>

      <description>An Associated Press investigation found that Bangladeshi workers were lured to Russia under the false promise of civilian work, only to be thrust into the chaos of combat in Ukraine. Many were threatened with violence, imprisonment or death.</description>

&lt;p&gt;On January 13, 2026, a large Turkish delegation, including officials from Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), arrived in Dhaka to hold consultations with Bangladesh Air Force officials. Afterward, Bangladeshi officials reportedly confirmed the acquisition of six Turkish-manufactured T129 ATAK attack helicopters, as well as Hisar-O+ medium-range surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, under a US$600 million deal.

      <title>Bangladesh Drifting Into A Nexus Of Military Dependency And Proxy Competition? Ominous Consequences For India, South Asia</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/bangladesh-drifting-nexus-military-dependency-and-proxy-competition-ominous-consequences</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these developments should ring alarm bells. The convergence of foreign military-industrial interests, Islamist political forces, and great-power rivalry risks turning Bangladesh into an epicenter of proxy competition and ideological confrontation. For a nation that has paid dearly for its independence and pluralistic identity, the cost of such entanglements may prove far higher than the short-term gains promised by arms deals and infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                                        &lt;p&gt;For average wage earners in Russia, it’s a big payday. For criminals seeking to escape the harsh conditions and abuse in prison, it’s a chance at freedom. &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/russia-immigrants-crackdown-xenophobia-central-asia-3fb300676f1855bc13e20bd7780534ea&quot;&gt;For immigrants hoping for a better life,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; it’s a simplified path to citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All they have to do is sign a contract to fight in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Russia seeks to replenish its forces in &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;nearly four years of war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — and avoid an unpopular nationwide mobilization — it’s pulling out all the stops to find new troops to send into the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some come from abroad to fight in what has become a bloody war of attrition. After signing a mutual defense treaty with Moscow in 2024, North Korea sent thousands of soldiers to help Russia &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-ukraine-casualties-kursk-russia-a1207ba61ded5061f721ffa0f0650851&quot;&gt;defend its Kursk region&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from a Ukrainian incursion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men from South Asian countries, including India, Nepal and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-bangladesh-migrant-workers-d7df6a8b2ff60b46ce8e3fa3aafaf60e&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, complain of being duped into signing up to fight by recruiters promising jobs. Officials in Kenya, South Africa and Iraq say the same has happened to citizens from their countries.&lt;/p&gt;


    
        




    


&lt;h2&gt;Russian numbers in Ukraine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-press-conference-ukraine-39fd3f2670227545a6f9e684038ed59d&quot;&gt;told his annual news conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure – 617,000 – in December 2023. It’s unclear if those numbers are accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still hidden are the numbers of military casualties, with Moscow having released limited official figures. The British Defense Ministry said last summer that more than 1 million Russian troops may have been killed or wounded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent Russian news site Mediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, scoured news reports, social media and government websites and collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed. More than 550 of those were foreigners from over two dozen countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;How Russia gets new soldiers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Ukraine, where martial law and nationwide mobilization has been in place since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Putin has resisted ordering a broad call-up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a limited mobilization of 300,000 men was tried later that year, tens of thousands of people fled abroad. The effort stopped after a few weeks when the target was met, but a Putin decree left the door open for another call-up. It also made all military contracts effectively open-ended and barred soldiers from quitting service or being discharged, unless they reached certain age limits or were incapacitated by injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Moscow has largely relied on what it describes as voluntary enlistment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flow of voluntary enlistees signing military contracts has remained strong, topping 400,000 last year, Putin said in December. It was not possible to independently verify the claim. Similar numbers were announced in 2024 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists say these contracts often stipulate a fixed term of service, such as one year, leading some potential enlistees to believe the commitment is temporary. But contracts are automatically extended indefinitely, they say. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;The incentives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government offers high pay and extensive benefits to enlistees. Regional authorities offer various enlistment bonuses, sometimes amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Khanty-Mansi region of central Russia, for example, an enlistee would get about $50,000 in various bonuses, according to the local government. That’s more than twice the average annual income in the region, where monthly salaries in the first 10 months of 2025 were reported to be just over $1,600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There also are tax breaks, debt relief and other perks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Kremlin claims of relying on voluntary enlistment, media reports and rights groups say conscripts — men aged 18-30 performing fixed-term mandatory military service and exempted from being sent to Ukraine — are often coerced by superiors into signing contracts that send them into battle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruitment also extends to prisoners and those in pretrial detention centers, a practice led early in the war by the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-convict-wagner-crime-108e410835e4bf27ac3192cd7f945b39&quot;&gt;late mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and adopted by the Defense Ministry. Laws now allow recruitment of both convicts and suspects in criminal cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;Targeting foreigners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreigners also are recruiting targets, both inside Russia and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laws were adopted offering accelerated Russian citizenship for enlistees. Russian media and activists also report that raids in areas where migrants typically live or work lead to them being pressuring into military service, with new citizens sent to enlistment offices to determine if they’re eligible for mandatory service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, Putin decreed that military service was mandatory for certain foreigners seeking permanent residency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some reportedly are lured to Russia by trafficking rings promising jobs, then duping them into signing military contracts. Cuban authorities in 2023 identified and sought to dismantle one such ring operating from Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nepal’s Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud told The Associated Press in 2024 that his country asked Russia to return &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/nepal-fighters-russia-ukraine-war-e57a45645666d02651f6efed4e3f21ae&quot;&gt;hundreds of Nepali nationals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who were recruited to fight in Ukraine, as well as to repatriate the remains of those killed in the war. Nepal has since barred citizens from traveling to Russia or Ukraine for work, citing recruitment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;Also in 2024, India’s federal investigation agency said it broke up a network that lured at least 35 of its citizens to Russia under the pretext of employment. The men were trained for combat and deployed to Ukraine against their will, with some “grievously injured,” the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Putin hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks in 2024, New Delhi said its nationals who were “misled” into joining the Russian army would be discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials say about 5,000 of its citizens have joined the Russian military along with an unspecified number who are fighting alongside Ukrainian forces. Officials in Baghdad cracked down on such recruiting networks, with one man convicted last year of human trafficking and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unknown number of Iraqis have been killed or gone missing while fighting in Ukraine. Some families have reported that relatives were lured to Russia under false pretenses and forced to enlist; in other cases, Iraqis have joined voluntarily for the salary and Russian citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreigners duped into fighting are especially vulnerable because they don’t speak Russian, have no military experience and are deemed “dispensable, to put it bluntly,” by military commanders, said Anton Gorbatsevich of the activist group Idite Lesom, or “Get Lost,” which helps men desert from the army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A drain on a slowing economy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, a Ukrainian agency for the treatment of prisoners of war said over 18,000 foreign nationals had fought or are fighting on the Russian side. Almost 3,400 have been killed, and hundreds of citizens of 40 countries are held in Ukraine as POWs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If true, that represents a fraction of the 700,000 troops that Putin said are fighting for Russia in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using foreigners is only one way to meet the constant demand, said Artyom Klyga, head of the legal department at the Movement of Conscientious Objectors, noting Russian recruitment efforts appear to be stable. Most of those seeking help from the group, which assists men in avoiding military service, are Russian citizens, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia researcher at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, said the Kremlin has gotten more “creative” in the last two years with attracting enlistees, including foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recruitment efforts are becoming “extremely expensive” for Russia, which faces a slowing economy, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associated Press writers Gerald Imray in Cape Town, South Africa, and Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad contributed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968995&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of Pakistan’s 15-member squad for the Twenty20 World Cup finally came on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among many talking points, the biggest was the exclusion of speedster Haris Rauf; despite his good showing at the Big Bash Down Under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he’d lost the trust of chief selector Aaqib Javed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964162&quot;&gt;suffered an injury&lt;/a&gt; during the Big Bash League, having missed the previous tri-series against Sri Lanka due to fitness issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Haris absent, Shaheen will have to bear greater responsibility; needing to take wickets in the early overs, and the death overs — which will be particularly challenging for him as his performance in that phase has not been great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman Mirza has emerged as a good pacer, performing well with both the new and old ball, while Naseem Shah’s fitness and performance were satisfactory, leading to his selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many others were overlooked. The selectors did not choose Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Wasim Jr., or Ahmed Daniyal, opting instead for fast-bowling all-rounder Faheem Ashraf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan, Saim Ayub, and skipper Salman Ali Agha are the spin-bowling all-rounders in the team, but their increased number, as well as the presence of multiple wicket-keepers seems to disrupt the team balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The squad includes three wicket-keepers, none of whom were the first choice for their Pakistan Super League franchises. Khawaja Nafay is with Quetta Gladiators, but the keeping is handled by Sri Lankans Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usman Khan played as a batsman for Multan Sultans and occasionally kept wickets, but Mohammad Rizwan was the number one choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahibzada Farhan kept wickets in just one match for Islamabad United, as Andries Gous and Azam Khan were the main wicket-keepers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, the cricketing world has wicket-keepers who are match-winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s philosophy is different. Instead of a specialist, any batter who can keep wickets is given a chance without considering how costly it could prove for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#babar-conundrum&quot; id=&quot;babar-conundrum&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Babar conundrum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further beyond, there are questions regarding former skipper Babar Azam’s selection, as his performance in the shortest format of the game hasn’t been very impressive of late; the batter coming off a below-par in Big Bash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a striking likeness between Babar and captain Salman Ali Agha. They are similar batters, occupying number three and four spots in the line-up. They may perform well in low-scoring matches, but could face difficulties in high-scoring games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The batting lineup has five openers who are capable of batting at different numbers, including Saim, Sahibzada, Babar, Fakhar Zaman and Nafay, who have all been seen playing in the top order for their franchises. However, when it comes to the middle-order, batters like Irfan Khan Niazi and Abdul Samad have not been given opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spotlight has been on the performance of Pakistan players in the Big Bash, while overlooking their performance in the Bangladesh Premier League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opener Sahibzada scored 185 runs in nine innings with a strike rate of 118.58, which is not particularly commendable. Similarly, Saim Ayub scored 68 runs in four innings with a strike rate of only 117.24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fakhar Zaman, who went to play in the International League T20, performed below his standards, scoring 260 runs in 12 innings with an average of 21.66 and a strike rate of 124.40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babar, meanwhile, played seven innings in the Big Bash, scoring 131 runs at a strike rate of 99.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#spin-strength&quot; id=&quot;spin-strength&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spin strength&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Pakistan’s spin department looks the strongest with two specialist spinners in Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, who are world-class. However, it might be difficult to see both play together since Nawaz, Shadab and Saim are the three spin-bowling all-rounders available. With their presence, it is likely that only one of Usman or Abrar is able to secure a spot in the playing eleven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan could benefit from the conditions in Sri Lanka, with the team playing all their matches in Colombo. Their biggest test will come against holders India, with the United States, Namibia and the Netherlands the other teams in the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On paper, Pakistan should advance from the group stage. Further ahead, it remains to be seen whether they can forge a combination that can help them go all the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Putting money first, cricket last</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969297/putting-money-first-cricket-last</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; The question is: if India is allowed to pick and choose, why should Bangladesh not be allowed to do the same?&amp;mdash;AFP/file &quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/6977f8d3092b0.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;The question is: if India is allowed to pick and choose, why should Bangladesh not be allowed to do the same?—AFP/file&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BANGLADESH’S&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt; removal&lt;/a&gt; from the ICC World T20 in India is the crisis that nobody wants to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you might find endless analysis on South Asian talk shows, but look internationally and it is a governance disaster that shall not be mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question why the international media will not discuss this issue, and the question of why Bangladesh is out of the tournament, both have the same answer: India’s absolute power over world cricket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) is meant to govern in the best interests of the global game. However, what was clear over two decades has crystallised over the last two years: the purpose of the ICC is exactly what critics claim — to borrow from Donald Trump’s vocabulary — to put India first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan should participate in the World T20; but it should also support Bangladesh‘s cause, and continue to point out the hypocrisy in the treatment that it receives, versus what India gets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is perfectly evident that there is one rule for India, and another for its opponents. This reality is enabled by the spineless apathy of the other so-called cricketing powers. The evidence is unquestionable and is unquestioningly ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has taken a political decision not to play bilateral tournaments against Pakistan. It has taken a political decision not to step foot on Pakistani soil. Cricketers from Pakistan and of Pakistani heritage face ridiculous processes to be allowed to participate in events in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is allowed to do this for purely political reasons, and the ICC says nothing. But, when another nation, Bangladesh in this instance, takes a similar position towards playing in India it is dropped from the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merits of Bangladesh’s argument are not even worth debating. Why do I say this? I say this because the merits of India’s arguments against Pakistan aren’t worth debating. They are purely political.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If India is allowed to pick and choose, why should Bangladesh not be allowed to do the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know the answer to this: Bangladesh is not responsible for the financial gravy train of international cricket, and it does not hold numerical sway at the ICC board. India first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second troubling aspect of this decision is the complete dismissal of the safety concerns of the Bangladesh team. The root of this row is the removal of Mustafizur Rahman from the IPL because of threats received promising disruption to matches that he would be involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if those safety concerns are credible enough to warrant his exit from an Indian tournament, then it doesn’t seem too unreasonable of Bangladesh to have concerns about playing matches in India. Yet the ICC says that there are no valid safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, nothing that the ICC says can be taken seriously given the absolute control that India holds over the ICC’s operations. India would not wish for any team to refuse to play in India for security reasons — while India can withdraw or refuse to play in a country whenever it wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this hypocrisy is evident in international cricket for a number of years. Even during the years of Pakistan’s exile from international cricket, security threats in other countries, including India, didn’t matter to cricket’s governing body. One rule for India and one rule for everybody else. India first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question that then remains is one of Pakistan’s participation in the tournament. The answer I believe is a simple one. Pakistan should participate in the World T20 because it has already agreed to the terms of its participation — namely that it will play its matches in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Pakistan should continue to support Bangladesh‘s cause within the ICC. Pakistan should continue to point out the hypocrisy in the treatment that it receives versus the treatment that India receives on the international stage. Pakistan should explain how the Bangladesh situation is another example of India first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shame here is that given the tumultuous decision that was taken, and given the significance of the governance crisis in the game, it is a matter that the world’s cricket nations seem eager to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are the game’s leading commentators? Where are the game’s great cricketers? Where are the people who believe in the spirit of cricket? Where are guardians of cricket’s moral galaxy when their voice is most needed? The answer is nowhere. Money talks. India first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the tournament does go ahead with Pakistan in it, we will inevitably see the ritual India Pakistan group contest. The fact that we cannot hold a world tournament without India and Pakistan playing a group match confirms the game’s abdication to the business suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to money spinning international tournaments, politics and principles are quickly put to one side. What really matters is open for the world to see. What really matters is the revenue that the ICC and the Indian cricket board can make from a match against Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the governance of international cricket is in the gutter. The game is being destroyed by greed and political motivations. But who has the guts to stand up to this? More importantly, who can put a stop to it? The answer is nobody. The strategy is always India first because by putting India first the other nations also put themselves first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the bully bullies on, the world is too timid to take on the bully. Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan to take final call on T20 World Cup participation by next week</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969326/pakistan-to-take-final-call-on-t20-world-cup-participation-by-next-week</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Pakistan is expected to make a final decision by next week, over the cricket team’s participation in next month’s Twenty20 World Cup, keeping open the possibility of a boycott over Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;withdrawal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision was expected on Monday, when Interior Minister and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, no decision was announced after the meeting, and Naqvi instead issued a statement on X, saying the “final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi had thrown the team’s participation into doubt on Saturday, saying Pakistan could pull out after the International Cricket Council replaced Bangladesh in the tournament. He had said then that he was waiting for the prime minister to return from abroad before coming to a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB chief says decision could come by Friday, or next week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the PM Office’s media team, Naqvi called on the prime minister on Monday and apprised the premier on the “International Cricket Council matter”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A source in the PM Office told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that even PM’s media team was not informed about the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A handout issued by the PMO, said: “During the meeting, he [interior minister] briefed the prime minister on the recent developments between the ICC and Bangl­adesh Cricket Board regarding the T20 World Cup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCB chief, meanwhile, stated that he had a “productive” meeting with PM Shehbaz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[I] briefed him on the ICC matter, and he directed that we resolve it while keeping all options on the table. It was agreed that the final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday,” the post read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-informed sources told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that Naqvi briefed the prime minister “on the positive and negative impacts of the options that can be adopted to show solidarity with Bangladesh”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A total boycott of the event is not the top priority, however, Pakistan could forfeit the group match against India to be held on Feb 15,” sources added. “For this, solid grounds are available to the PCB, which could avoid any sanctions or penalty on it from the ICC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources pointed to the frosty ties between India and Pakistan, with the two countries having come to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509&quot;&gt;brink of war&lt;/a&gt; in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan can say it is following the instructions of the government in not playing against India. In that case, the ICC cannot impose any cash penalty or sanctions on PCB.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh with Scotland on Saturday following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governing ICC rejected Bangladesh’s request to move their matches to tournament co-host Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB has accepted the decision and said it will not be involved in further arbitration over the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have accepted the decision of the ICC board,” a BCB media official said in a statement. “Since the ICC has said that we cannot go and play or they cannot shift our games to Sri Lanka, in this case we cannot go and play in India. Our position remains the same. We are not going to any separate arbitration or anything here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had backed Bangladesh’s stance in Wednesday’s ICC Board virtual meeting, saying there was a precedence of relocating India’s matches on security fears from Pakistan in last year’s Champions Trophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then India, who have not toured Pakistan since 2008, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1894430&quot;&gt;played&lt;/a&gt; all their matches in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same option was given to Pakistan who will not tour India and play their World Cup matches in Sri Lanka under an agreement signed last year saying the two countries will play on neutral venues whenever one of them hosts an ICC event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>World not ready for rise in extreme heat, scientists say</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969268/world-not-ready-for-rise-in-extreme-heat-scientists-say</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PARIS: Nearly 3.8 billion people could face extreme heat by 2050 and while tropical countries will bear the brunt cooler regions will also need to adapt, scientists said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for cooling will “drastically” increase in giant countries like Brazil, Indonesia and Nigeria, where hundreds of millions of people lack air conditioning or other means of beating the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even a moderate increase in hotter days could have a “severe impact” in nations not used to such conditions like Canada, Russia and Finland, said scientists from the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new study, they looked at different global warming scenarios to project how often people in future might experience temperatures considered uncomfortably hot or cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found “that the population experiencing extreme heat conditions is projected to nearly double” by 2050 if global average temperatures rise 2C above preindustrial times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of the impact would be felt this decade as the world fast approaches the 1.5C mark, the study’s lead author Jesus Lizana said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The key takeaway from this is that the need for adaptation to extreme heat is more urgent than previously known,” said Lizana, an environmental scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New infrastructure, such as sustainable air conditioning or passive cooling, needs to be built out within the next few years to ensure people can cope with dangerous heat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolonged exposure to extreme heat can overwhelm the body’s natural cooling systems, causing symptoms ranging from dizziness and headaches to organ failure and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is called a silent killer because most heat deaths occur gradually as high temperatures and other environmental factors work together to undermine the body’s internal thermostat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is making heatwaves longer and stronger and access to cooling, especially air conditioning, will be vital in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dangerously underprepared&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-025-01754-y&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Sustainability, projected that 3.79 billion people worldwide could be exposed to extreme heat by mid century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would “drastically” increase energy demand for cooling in developing nations where the gravest health consequences would be felt. India, the Philippines and Bangladesh would be among biggest populations impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant change in “cooling degree days” temperatures hot enough to require cooling, such as air conditioning or fans were projected in tropical or equatorial countries, particularly in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central African Republic, Nigeria, South Sudan, Laos and Brazil saw the biggest rise in dangerously hot temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Put simply, the most disadvantaged people are the ones who will bare the brunt of this trend our study shows for ever hotter days,” climate scientist Radhika Khosla said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wealthier countries in traditionally cooler climates also “face a major a problem even if many do not realise it yet”, she added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla accused Pakistan of instigating Bangladesh&apos;s refusal to play T20 World Cup matches in India, leading to Scotland&apos;s inclusion in the tournament. Shukla asserted Bangladesh was assured of security, but Pakistan&apos;s &quot;intervention&quot; and &quot;misleading&quot; tactics aggravated the situation. This comes amid Pakistan&apos;s own deliberation over participating in the tournament.</description>

      <description>Cricket Scotland&apos;s CEO expressed sympathy for Bangladesh after their ICC Men&apos;s T20 World Cup 2026 replacement, acknowledging the unusual circumstances. Bangladesh were removed for refusing to play under the published schedule, a request the ICC denied due to security assurances. Scotland, ranked 14th, step in, despite their own qualification campaign not going as planned.</description>

      <title>Rs15bn tax rebate splits rice exporters</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969295/rs15bn-tax-rebate-splits-rice-exporters</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: At a time when rice exports are steadily declining, the Ministry of Commerce has allocated around Rs15 billion for a rebate scheme on local taxes and levies for rice exporters, raising concerns about a potential rise in domestic prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exporters remain divided over the government’s decision, which has been presented as a support measure for the sector. Several industry players, however, argue that the move fails to address the structural problems confronting rice exports and instead risks shifting the burden onto domestic consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (REAP) Chairman Faisal Jahangir told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that the Drawback on Local Taxes and Levies (DLTL) scheme would help lower export prices and improve Pakistan’s ability to compete with global suppliers. He said Indian rice was currently being offered at significantly lower prices, making it difficult for Pakistani exporters to maintain their foothold in international markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics warn move could push up domestic prices, benefit stockists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Jahangir said the rebate would help exporters maintain market share amid intense competition, adding that the support was intended to ease cost pressures faced by the industry. He rejected concerns that the scheme would push up domestic rice prices, maintaining that the rebate was designed to support exports rather than influence the local market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nine per cent rebate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a notification issued by the commerce ministry, exporters of basmati and brown rice are eligible for a rebate of 9 per cent of the free-on-board (FOB) value, provided the export price is equal to or above $750 per metric tonne. Other coarse rice qualifies for a lower rebate of 3pc of FOB value, but only where the export price remains below $750 per tonne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Karachi-based rice exporter told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that Pakistan’s bureaucracy has a long history of repeating policy mistakes dating back to the 1960s, relying on short-term measures such as rebates and subsidies to keep export sectors afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said these stopgap incentives have failed to deliver sustained growth, leaving exports largely stagnant despite repeated fiscal support. By contrast, he said regional competitors such as China, India, Bangladesh and Vietnam have focused on structural reforms to improve productivity, logistics and cost efficiency, enabling their exporters to compete more effectively in global markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exporters say rice exports have declined since the removal of the minimum export price due to higher cultivation, milling, financing and tax costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to exporters, sustainable price competitiveness can only come from higher output and productivity, not from rent-based incentives that encourage speculative behaviour. In their view, reducing rice prices through increased production would generate real wealth across the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They point to India, noting that Indian rice prices, particularly basmati, have declined due to higher production, improved per-acre yields, and the development of new varieties that can be cultivated across different regions. Some exporters warn that the incentive could drive up domestic rice prices, benefiting stockists rather than exporters while squeezing consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also point out that linking rebates to FOB values instead of export volumes sends a price signal back into the domestic market, pushing up paddy procurement rates, particularly for basmati, where the rebate rises to 9pc above the $750 per tonne threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>T20 World Cup: Naqvi briefs PM Shehbaz on ‘ICC matter’, says final decision to come by Friday or Monday</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969177/t20-world-cup-naqvi-briefs-pm-shehbaz-on-icc-matter-says-final-decision-to-come-by-friday-or-monday</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Monday said that he briefed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the “International Cricket Council (ICC) matter”, saying that a “final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a handout by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Naqvi had called on the premier in Islamabad earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the meeting, he briefed the prime minister on the recent situation regarding ICC T20 World Cup and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB),” the handout said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), stated that he had a “productive” meeting with PM Shehbaz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[I] briefed him on the ICC matter, and he directed that we resolve it while keeping all options on the table. It was agreed that the final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday,” the post read.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes as questions have been raised about Pakistan’s participation in the tournament following the ICC’s decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland on Saturday, which is scheduled to begin next month, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governing ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;rejected &lt;/a&gt;Bangladesh’s request to move their matches to tournament co-host Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours before the ICC had announced its decision, Naqvi had said that Bangladesh was being treated unfairly and should be allowed to participate in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, he had said that Pakistan’s participation was still not confirmed. “The prime minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I’ll be able to give you our final decision,” Naqvi had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the International Cricketers’ Association &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;on Sunday that the absence of Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup was a sad moment for the game and should serve as a call for stakeholders to work towards uniting the sport, not dividing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The withdrawal of Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup, and resulting absence of a valued cricketing nation from cricket’s pinnacle international T20 event, is a sad moment for our sport, the Bangladesh players and fans, and one that requires deep reflection,” World Cricketers’ Association (WCA) Chief Executive Tom Moffat had said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>A Bangladesh government committee said on Monday it had found &quot;egregious anomalies&quot; in a billion-dollar cross-border electricity supply deal with Indian conglomerate Adani, providing around 10 percent of the country&apos;s power. The National Review Committee on Power Purchase Agreements said it had found &quot;examples of egregious anomalies&quot;, that meant the state-owned Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) was paying up to 50 percent more than it should.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh court sentences ex-police chief, 2 others to death for 2024 protest crackdown</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969171/bangladesh-court-sentences-ex-police-chief-2-others-to-death-for-2024-protest-crackdown</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced Dhaka’s fugitive former police chief and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1852020#:~:text=It%20also%20named%20detective%20branch%20chief%20Harun%2Dor%2DRashid&quot;&gt;two senior colleagues&lt;/a&gt; to be hanged for crimes against humanity committed during the rule of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three, including the capital’s former police chief, Habibur Rahman, were tried in absentia, and their whereabouts are not known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict comes ahead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968417&quot;&gt;elections on February 12&lt;/a&gt;, the first in the South Asian country of 170 million people since Hasina’s overthrow in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five other ex-police officers were sentenced to varying terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1852020/bangladesh-court-opens-murder-case-against-ex-premier-sheikh-hasina&quot;&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; concerned the killing of six protesters in Dhaka on August 5, 2024, the day Hasina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief&quot;&gt;fled to India&lt;/a&gt; as protesters stormed her palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The police forces… opened fire with lethal weapons… causing death to the aforesaid six persons,” judge Golam Mortuza Mozumder read to the court in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court heard how Rahman sent messages to police units ordering the use of lethal force to crush the protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief prosecutor Tajul Islam said he was satisfied with the verdict against the three men, although he wanted tougher sentences for the five others found guilty who were handed prison terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The court said their crimes have been proved and they committed crimes against humanity,” Islam told the reporters after the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, the same court also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced Hasina&lt;/a&gt; — who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969057/bangladesh-slams-india-over-hasinas-speech&quot;&gt;remains in hiding&lt;/a&gt; in India — to death for crimes against humanity. She refused to attend the trial and denies the charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal was also sentenced to death in absentia after being found guilty of crimes against humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who was in court and had pleaded guilty, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>CORPORATE WINDOW : Heading toward a cliff</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968944/corporate-window-heading-toward-a-cliff</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a peculiar ritual in Islamabad whenever the European Union extends the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) status. Bureaucrats congratulate one another, press releases claim a diplomatic victory, and the textile sector breathes a collective sigh of relief. This self-congratulation, however, masks a dangerous complacency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the extension of the GSP+ regime until 2027 has provided a temporary lifeline, the mood in Brussels is shifting. The recent warnings from the European Union (EU) Ambassador — stating that Pakistan needs to do more — are not merely diplomatic pleasantries. As we inch closer to the 2027 expiration, Pakistan faces a dual threat: a stagnant domestic human rights record as per GSP+ standards and a rapidly evolving, more protectionist Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For over a decade, GSP+ has been the single most effective economic steroid for Pakistan. The numbers tell the story of a desperate reliance. Since the status was granted in 2014, Pakistan’s exports to the EU have surged by nearly 92 per cent, rising from $4.7 billion in 2014 to approximately $9bn in the FY25 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is now our second most important trading partner, absorbing nearly 28pc of our total exports. For an economy gasping for foreign exchange and struggling with a chronic balance of payments crisis, duty-free access to the single market is not a luxury; it is oxygen. Without GSP+, our key export — especially textiles, which make up over 75pc of our EU-bound shipments — would face the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariffs of roughly 12pc. In an industry where margins are measured in cents, that surcharge would mean a death sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we inch closer to the 2027 expiration date of the GSP+ regime, Pakistan faces the dual threat of a stagnant domestic human rights record and a more protectionist Europe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, we treat this privilege as a permanent entitlement rather than a conditional incentive. The first crack in the foundation is the widening gap between legislation and implementation. While Islamabad takes comfort in having ratified the requisite 27 international conventions, Brussels is no longer interested in signatures. They are looking at the application of laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirements for the post-2027 regime are set to become far more rigorous. The list of mandatory conventions is expected to expand from 27 to 32. New additions will likely include stricter adherence to the Paris Agreement on climate change and protocols against transnational organized crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, our compliance record is flashing red. Their perceived suppression of digital rights and internet freedom is now a trade issue. A Europe dealing with war on its own continent is not willing to relax the suppression of civil liberties in other regions. The upcoming monitoring mission will likely be the decisive factor for our re-application in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Pakistan congratulates itself on $9bn in exports, our competitors are playing a different game. Vietnam, once a peer, has left us in the dust. In 2023 alone, Vietnam’s exports to the EU topped $50bn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did they do it? While Pakistan relied on GSP+ to sell basic bed linen and towels, Vietnam negotiated a full Free Trade Agreement that came into effect in 2020. They diversified beyond textiles into electronics and machinery. Even within textiles, Vietnam and Bangladesh have aggressively pivoted to man-made fibres, which now command a larger share of the global market than cotton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan remains addicted to cotton-based low-value exports. Bangladesh, holding a 21pc share of the EU’s non-EU apparel market compared to our single digits, is already preparing for its graduation from the ‘least developed countries’ status by negotiating new partnership terms. Meanwhile, we are standing still on a moving walkway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, and perhaps more lethal threat, is the changing political and legal anatomy of Europe itself. The Europe of 2025 is not the Europe of 2014. A rightward shift across the continent — ushering in a new era of economic protectionism — is coinciding with the EU’s new Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This directive changes the playing field entirely. It holds European companies legally liable for environmental and human rights violations in their supply chains. If a factory in Faisalabad dumps untreated water or relies on underpaid contract labor, the liability now travels all the way to a retailer in Berlin. European buyers are already risk-averse; facing potential lawsuits at home, they will not hesitate to cut off Pakistani suppliers that cannot prove impeccable compliance standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s textile industry needs to understand that the days of competing solely on price are ending; the new competition is on compliance. While advocating for an enabling environment is, indeed, warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to secure the GSP+ lifeline beyond 2027, the government must urgently address the uncompetitive energy costs crippling the value-added textile sector. Currently, Pakistani exporters pay an average industrial tariff of 13.2 cents/kWh, significantly higher than regional competitors like Vietnam (7.0 cents), India (9.5 cents), and Bangladesh (10.2 cents).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 30–80pc energy cost premium erodes the 9.6pc duty advantage offered by GSP+. Immediate governmental support is required to remove cross-subsidies through decoupling industrial tariffs from residential subsidies to achieve a regionally competitive rate of 9 cents/kWh. Additionally, zero-rated status should be restored in a way that automates sales tax refunds to resolve the liquidity crunch preventing modernization in knitting and finishing units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are sleepwalking toward a cliff. If Pakistan loses GSP+ in 2027, or if we fail to qualify for the successor arrangement due to our inability to meet the new Plus requirements, the economic shock would be catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government must stop viewing GSP+ as a trade negotiation and start viewing it as a domestic reform agenda. Diplomatic lobbying can buy time, and it has bought us until 2027. But it cannot buy compliance. The window is closing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The writer is a Director of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce &amp;amp; Industry.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A socially compromised people</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968935/a-socially-compromised-people</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The digitally conducted Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) FY25 helps explain Pakistan’s dangerously high public discontent, along with the risks and opportunities the situation entails. A more informed and connected population trapped in economic stagnation creates fertile ground for populism, criminal and terrorist networks. Yet, with timely policy shifts that unlock sustained growth, the same awareness and connectivity could drive rapid development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost universal connectivity, rapid digitisation, and access to limitless online information have dismantled the old notion that deprivation is a matter of fate. Greater public exposure to comforts online has sparked aspirations and increased awareness of wealth and income disparity and opportunity gaps. While the desire to improve life and living standards is powerful, the absence of a clear pathway for personal growth and career advancement pushes many towards shortcuts, often blurring ethical boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest HIES shows little progress in key social and economic indicators since the FY19 survey. Literacy rose only marginally from 60 per cent to 63pc, while the share of out-of-school children aged 5-16 declined slightly from 30pc to 28pc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health outcomes improved marginally: better immunisation coverage, pre- and post-natal care, and access to skilled birth attendants helped reduce neonatal and infant mortality, yet rates remain high at 35 and 47 per thousand live births, respectively. Gains in housing quality, access to piped water and sanitation are simply limited and male employment rates have dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pakistan has become one of the region’s most digitally connected societies, yet social progress remains slow and male employment has fallen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the survey records a dramatic surge in digital connectivity. Household internet access more than doubled from 34pc in FY19 to 70pc in FY25. Mobile phone ownership reached 96pc of households, with 98pc of urban households connected to the internet. Individual internet use rose sharply from 17pc to 57pc over the period.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Better-informed individuals can clearly see the gap between their living standards and those of the wealthy. This sense of ‘relative deprivation’ is a powerful source of discontent. People increasingly recognise that their circumstances are not merely the result of personal failure but stem from broader structural problems, including political patronage, unfair systems, wage stagnation, limited access to affordable education, and discrimination. This awareness fuels frustration with the existing order, replacing passive acceptance with growing resentment,” remarked an analyst anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Despite private security and state-of-the-art safeguards at my home and factories, I don’t feel safe,” a leading business tycoon said, reflecting on Bangladesh’s 2024 youth uprising. “I fear the anger of a large pool of frustrated young people turning against those seen as successful. I don’t believe that the state could protect the elite if mob fury spills over. I‘ve already moved my family abroad and am exploring options to shift part of my business to the West.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I believe the risk of public backlash spiralling into an anarchic situation is real. The government must act swiftly to stabilise the economy and pursue a more inclusive growth model. The elite should also curb conspicuous consumption to avoid provoking public resentment. Businesses, meanwhile, need to abandon the practice of suppressing wages, which form only a small share of costs and are already far below global norms, and start respecting employees’ right to dignified living,” a leading businessman said privately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an Islamabad-based economist questioned, “Are the HIES findings even credible? Can a sample survey truly reflect on-ground reality?” The survey, conducted by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), covers 2,343 enumeration blocks and 32,785 households nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defended the HIES methodology, PBS’s chief statistician, Dr Naeem uz Zafar, noted that the high mobile penetration is corroborated by the Pakistan Telecommunication Agency. He acknowledged the puzzling decline in male employment, partly reflected in gig work captured by the Labour Force Survey FY25. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that while enrolment gains appear modest, improving gender parity and stronger female participation in education indicate greater human capital gains for women. Improvements in family planning and maternal, newborn, and child health indicators, he said, also point to growing awareness and better health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A formal cabinet response on the HIES did not arrive by the deadline, but Dr Nadeem Javed, Vice Chancellor, Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, described the survey as revealing “a striking paradox”: Pakistan has become one of the region’s most digitally connected societies, with near universal mobile ownership and about 70pc internet access, yet social progress remains slow and male employment has fallen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He attributed this to household economic stress in recent years. While household incomes rose by roughly 97pc, household spending climbed faster, about 133pc, driven largely by higher electricity, gas and health costs. This squeezed spending on food, education and small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Digital access on its own could not offset these pressures. Without digital work and commerce, connectivity remains a convenience rather than a livelihood,” he argued. “As recovery takes hold, policy must pivot from access to opportunity, linking connectivity with skills, online work, digital trade and small business growth to translate reach into productivity, incomes and human development,” Dr Javed added. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Harbhajan Singh criticized Pakistan&apos;s stance on Bangladesh&apos;s T20 World Cup exclusion, calling it an unnecessary attempt to create a &apos;2 vs 1&apos; scenario. He argued that Pakistan&apos;s intervention was uncalled for, as Bangladesh and its players are the ones suffering the most. Harbhajan also suggested the BCB let ego guide its decisions, hindering potential resolutions.</description>

      <title>Babar, Shaheen to play for Pakistan in T20 World Cup; Haris Rauf left out</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968995/babar-shaheen-to-play-for-pakistan-in-t20-world-cup-haris-rauf-left-out</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) left out express pacer Haris Rauf from the 15-man squad named on Sunday for next month’s ICC T20 World Cup jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka, although former captains Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi were named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made in a press conference by PCB High Performance Director and member of the men’s national selection committee Aaqib Javed, who was speaking alongside skipper Salman and white-ball head coach Michael James Hesson at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheRealPCB/status/2015343600062861528&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 32-year-old Rauf finished with 20 wickets in the Big Bash League in Australia, but selector Aaqib Javed said he doesn’t fit in the combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rauf has played a lot of cricket for Pakistan, but we kept conditions in Sri Lanka in mind while selecting the squad,” Javed told a press conference in Lahore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rauf is also the highest wicket-taker for Pakistan in T20I cricket with 133 in 94 matches.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/therealpcb/status/2015311970573176967?s=61&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the players, Salman, Faheem Ashraf, Khawaja Mohammad Nafay, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Sahibzada Farhan and Usman Tariq have received their maiden mega-event call-ups to the Pakistan squad, PCB said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Abrar Ahmed, Babar, Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Nawaz, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Shaheen, Shadab Khan and Usman Khan have played in at least one or more editions of the tournament since 2021, the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 20-team tournament, each team is set to play four group games before the Super Eight and Knockout Stage, all between February 7 and March 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan are also set to face Australia in a three-match T20I series at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore on January 29, 31 and Feb 1, with the preparation camp starting today, the PCB statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babar and Shaheen were also named in Pakistan’s squad for the three-match series after being dropped from the T20I series against Sri Lanka last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked during the presser about Babar’s inclusion in the World Cup squad despite “not meeting international standards”, Javed said he has been “the most consistent batsman”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Babar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968416&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he would miss the remainder of the Big Bash League in Australia since he had been recalled to Pakistan for a national team camp ahead of the T20I series with Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman, on being asked if Pakistan stood to gain an advantage similar to “the way India did during the previous ICC Champions Trophy, as all their matches were in the UAE,” the captain admitted that Pakistan did have an advantage this time. However, he maintained that winning depended on whether the team played well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“India won because they played good cricket. If we do the same, we will win as well,” Salman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2025, a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;hybrid model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” was decided upon whereby India played all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1894430#:~:text=The%20deal%20means%20Pakistan%20will%20play%20at%20a%20neutral%20venue%20in%20any%20ICC%20tournament%20hosted%20by%20India%20until%202027.&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;compromise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan are set to play all their matches at the upcoming T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, though PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday their participation was still not confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman further said that “in the past three tournaments, the team had not performed well”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued: “When you play a world cup, it is always going to be tough[..] you can not stay relaxed in any situation [..] it will be challenging, and we are both ready and excited for it”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked “why Muhammad Rizwan was not chosen to be in the squad despite having more experience in Sri Lanka than Babar,” Javed said, “You have to take into account the batting composition of your team — both the coach and captain think that babar can play a vital role in the team — so it does not mean that one is being given a chance and the other is not, we have to look at how the team can have a more competiteive batting line up”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went on to say that the argument had “no logic”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to look at who fits better in the squad and which player can make the team better,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head coach Hesson, responding to a question about the inclusion of Khawaja Nafay and Usman Khan as the wicket keepers despite Nafay’s “inexperience, and Usman’s “poor performance”, maintained that “Usman Khan has been exceptional since he has come back in the squad”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“His wicket-keeping has probably been better than expected,” Hesson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued: “As for Khawaja Nafay, we looked at Sahibzada Farhan as the backup keeper, but unfortunately, he became a bit vulnerable to injury with the extra load from a keeping perspective. That was something we did not want to risk”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head coach stressed that Farhan was a “big player” for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we would have to put him in a difficult situation forced our hand a little bit [..] that is where Nafay came in as a power player through the middle,” the head coach said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are very comfortable with the two keeping options we have,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman, in response to a question over whether Babar’s “performance was a cause for concern”, said that the player’s performance “has not been as bad as you people show, his big bash did not go well, but that is a different condition”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think since his comeback, he has been performing well in the T20s and all that matters to me is that he performs well for Pakistan,” the captain added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailing the batting plan, the captain said that only the “other than the openers, the rest can only be decided upon the given situation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In T20, other than openers, you have no idea what situation you will find yourself in,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about the line-up, Javed maintained that it was the same squad “which had been in continuity for the past three to four series”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is not like we have formed a special or different team for the World Cup; however, different conditions are always taken into account, and changes can be made,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head coach Hesson, talking about Rauf’s exclusion from the squad, said, “Firstly, when we decided to take three seamers to Sri Lanka, there is obviously going to be some unlucky seamers, and Waseem Junior, Ahmed Daniyal, and Haris Rauf are three that were certainly considered, but there was no spot unfortunately”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the three seamers included in the squad — Shaheen Shah Afridi, Salman Mirza, and Naseem Shah — “can bowl in all three phases of the game”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further added: “Previous World Cups, we have always taken an extra seamer because conditions have dictated that, whereas in this situation we haven’t gone down that path”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailing Babar’s role in the squad, the head coach stated, “We see a very different role for Babar than what you have in the BBL”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Babar Azam has a lot of other skills to offer,” he said, recalling that the decision to add Babar was also taken “to complement the other players we have”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know what a world-class player he is and how flexible he can be, depending on what the team requires,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On being asked about a potential boycott of the World Cup by Pakistan, following a statement made by the chairman PCB, Javed said that their role was limited to selecting the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, it is up to the government to decide, and we will wait for their decision,” said Javed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day earlier, ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793/t20-world-cup-naqvi-rues-unfair-treatment-of-bangladesh-says-one-country-cannot-dictate-another&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Scotland would replace Bangladesh at the T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player, Mustafizur Rahman, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is also Chairman PCB, when asked about a potential boycott of the World Cup, said the government of Pakistan would make the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are waiting for the prime minister to return,” he said, adding that a final decision would be taken then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15-member squad for T20 World Cup:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman Ali Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Mohammad Nafay (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan (wk), Saim Ayub, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Shadab Khan, Usman Khan (wk) and Usman Tariq.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh absence from T20 World Cup a sad moment for the game: International Cricketers’ Association</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999/bangladesh-absence-from-t20-world-cup-a-sad-moment-for-the-game-international-cricketers-association</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The absence of Bangladesh from next month’s T20 World Cup is a sad moment for the game and should serve as a call for stakeholders to work towards uniting the sport, not dividing it, the International Cricketers’ Association said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the 20-team showpiece on Saturday following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected Bangladesh’s request to move their matches to tournament co-host Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The withdrawal of Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup, and resulting absence of a valued cricketing nation from cricket’s pinnacle international T20 event, is a sad moment for our sport, the Bangladesh players and fans, and one that requires deep reflection,” World Cricketers’ Association (WCA) Chief Executive Tom Moffat said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than allowing division or exclusion to take hold, we call on the games’ leaders to work with all stakeholders, including governing bodies, leagues and players, to unite the sport, not divide it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events underline the current tension in South Asian cricket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s fraught relations with Pakistan prompted the ICC to broker an arrangement allowing them to play at a neutral venue when their neighbour hosts a global tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2025, a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;hybrid model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” was decided upon whereby India played all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1894430#:~:text=The%20deal%20means%20Pakistan%20will%20play%20at%20a%20neutral%20venue%20in%20any%20ICC%20tournament%20hosted%20by%20India%20until%202027.&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;compromise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan are set to play all their matches at the upcoming T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, though the Pakistan Cricket Board chief Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday their participation was still not confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The prime minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I’ll be able to give you our final decision,” Naqvi, who is also the country’s interior minister, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moffat said the WCA had become increasingly concerned by agreements not being honoured in the sport and by a lack of meaningful consultation with players and their representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It also highlights significant issues with the game’s existing operating model at the global level,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These issues, if continued to be left unaddressed, will weaken trust, unity, and ultimately the health and future of the game we love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Pakistani captain and all-rounder Shahid Afridi said on the replacement of Bangladesh by Scotland that he was “deeply disappointed” by ICC’s “inconsistency”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a former international cricketer who has played in Bangladesh and in ICC events, I’m deeply disappointed by today’s ICC’s inconsistency. It accepted India’s security concerns for not touring Pakistan in 2025, yet appears unwilling to apply the same understanding to Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Consistency and fairness are the foundation of global cricket governance. Bangladesh’s players and millions of its fans deserve respect — not mixed standards. The ICC should build bridges, not burn them,” Afridi said in a post on social media platform X.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Pakistani batsman Mohammad Yousaf expressed similar views, saying: “Very sad to see a cricket-loving nation like Bangladesh being deprived of cricket due to security concerns not being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When similar concerns were raised earlier, a neutral venue was approved. Standards cannot change from country to country. ICC must act as the International Cricket Council, not appear to serve the interests of any single board. Fairness and consistency are the foundation of global cricket.”&lt;/p&gt;

He questioned the lack of consistency, drawing parallels to India being allowed to play the 2025 Champions Trophy at a neutral venue due to security concerns in Pakistan. This decision has sparked wider unease within the cricketing community.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh says ex-captain Shakib Al Hasan can return for national team selection</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968993/bangladesh-says-ex-captain-shakib-al-hasan-can-return-for-national-team-selection</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh cricket chiefs have reopened the door for ex-captain Shakib Al Hasan’s return, a star player but who was also a lawmaker in the former ruling party overthrown in a 2024 uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shakib’s links to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ousted&lt;/a&gt; leader Sheikh Hasina made him a target of public anger, and he was among dozens facing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1855049&quot;&gt;murder investigations&lt;/a&gt; for a deadly police crackdown on protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all-rounder announced his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1861266&quot;&gt;retirement&lt;/a&gt; from international cricket in 2024, but said he would like to reverse that decision last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) senior official Amzad Hossain said he could play again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board has taken a unanimous decision that if Shakib Al Hasan’s availability, fitness and accessibility allow it — and if he can be present at the venue where matches are played — then the board and the selection panel will consider him for the national team,” Hossain told reporters late Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the BCB would issue Shakib no-objection certificates (NOC) to play in overseas leagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If he wants to participate in other global tournaments, the board will provide him NOC as required,” Amzad added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shakib had earlier apologised for remaining silent during the student-led uprising but defended his decision to serve the regime it toppled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh cricket is reeling from being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;kicked out&lt;/a&gt; of next month’s T20 World Cup, after the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday replaced Bangladesh with Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to send its players to India and pleaded for games to be shifted to co-host Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute between New Delhi and Dhaka erupted this month when the Indian cricket board ordered the Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it had found no credible security threat to Bangladesh in India, but the BCB said the matter was beyond their control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a government decision taken on security grounds,” Amzad said. “Because of that, there was nothing more we could do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shakib was playing in a domestic Twenty20 cricket competition in Canada when Hasina’s government collapsed and has not returned to Bangladesh since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-arm allrounder has played 71 Tests, 247 one-day internationals and 129 Twenty20s for Bangladesh, taking a combined 712 wickets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968925/trade-gap-with-nine-neighbours-widens-444pc-in-first-half</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan’s trade deficit with nine neighbouring countries widened by 44.42 per cent to $7.683 billion in the first half of FY26 compared to $5.320bn during the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soaring deficit was mainly due to a decline in Pakistan’s overall exports to regional countries, led by a drop in shipments to China, followed by Afghanistan and Bangla­desh. Pakistan has suspended all kinds of trade, including exports, with Afghanistan since Oct 10, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In percentage terms, exports to India increased marginally, but in value terms, it is negligible. The shipments to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka registered negative growth during the period under review, according to the latest data compiled by the State Bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In FY25, the trade deficit with these nine neighbouring countries widened by 29.42pc to $12.297bn, up from $9.502bn in the preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of exports to Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives dipped 18.56pc to $1.965bn in July-December FY26 from $2.413bn over the same period last year. Contrary to this, imports surged 24.76pc to $9.648bn in 6MFY26 from $7.733bn over the same period last year. Imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the preceding year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imports from China grew by 25.61pc to $9.472bn in 6MFY26 from $7.541bn over the same period last year. The bulk of imports in the region is sourced from China, followed partially by India and Bangladesh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exports to China fell by 5.59pc to $1.216bn in 6MFY26 from $1.288bn over the same period last year. Imports from India dipped by 12.73pc to $97.734m in 6MFY26 from $111.991m over the last year. In FY25, imports from India increased to $220.58m from $206.89m over the last year. Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $2.926m in 6MFY26, up from $0.399m over the last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exports to Afghanistan dipped 56.61pc to $219.489m in 6MFY26 from $505.818m last year. Imports stood at $6.321m in 6MFY26 against $9.994m in FY25, a drop of 36.75pc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exports to Bangladesh declined by 7.54pc to $358.499m in 6MFY26 from $387.772m over the last year. In FY25, exports to Bangladesh increased by 19.08pc to $787.35m from $661.19m. Imports grew 7.41pc to $36.882m in 6MFY26 from $39.832m over the last year.  Exports to Sri Lanka dipped by 27.13pc to $163.173m in 6MFY26 from $223.912m over the last year. Imports, however, rose 12.71pc to $33.414m in 6MFY26 from $29.647m over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
