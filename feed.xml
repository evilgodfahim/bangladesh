      <title>T20 World Cup: India tune-up for Pakistan showdown with 93-run rout of Namibia</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972737/t20-world-cup-india-tune-up-for-pakistan-showdown-with-93-run-rout-of-namibia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;India tuned up for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;blockbuster showdown&lt;/a&gt; with Pakistan at the Men’s T20 World Cup with a 93-run hammering of Namibia at New Delhi’s Arun Jaitley Stadium on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the high-octane game against their arch-rivals looming in Colombo on Sunday, Ishan Kishan got in the mood with 61 off just 24 balls to push India to 209-9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namibia, who won the toss and chose to field, were bowled out for 116 as India matched Pakistan in making it two wins out of two in Group A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinner Varun Chakravarthy put the squeeze on Namibia, who started their innings brightly, with 3-7 from two overs as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1842745&quot;&gt;defending champions &lt;/a&gt;India made it 10 wins in a row in T20 World Cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chakravarthy struck with his first ball to remove Louren Steenkamp for 29 and took two more wickets in his second over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellow spinner Axar Patel took two wickets with his left-arm spin, including Malan Kruger, for five, when Jasprit Bumrah took a high, diving catch at short fine-leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardik Pandya took two wickets in two balls near the end, but the hat-trick was averted before the innings folded in 18.2 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For India, Sanju Samson struck 22 in eight balls and Kishan smacked left-arm pace bowler JJ Smit for four sixes and a four to raise his fifty off 20 balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India raced to 100 in the seventh over before off-spinner Gerhard Erasmus dismissed Kishan with the first ball of his spell before finishing with 4-20 from his four overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India had a mini-collapse from 104-1 to 124-4, before Pandya, who hit 52, and Shivam Dube, who made 23, rebuilt the innings with a stand of 81 for the fifth wicket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandya fell to Erasmus with substitute fielder Dylan Leicher taking a stunning grab in the deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He caught the ball on the run but flipped the ball up inside the playing area as he stepped over the ropes, before crossing back to complete the catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan government late on Tuesday reversed its order for the cricket team to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;boycott &lt;/a&gt;Sunday’s match as a protest at Bangladesh being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;kicked out &lt;/a&gt;of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India top the group from Pakistan on net run rate, and the winner of Sunday’s clash will be assured of advancing to the Super Eight stage as one of the top two in the five-team group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Early counts show BNP ahead in Bangladesh election after strong turnout</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/early-counts-show-bnp-ahead-in-bangladesh-election-after-strong-turnout</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party raced ahead of its rival Jamaat-i-Islami on Thursday, early counting showed, after tens of millions of Bangladeshis voted in a pivotal national election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first vote since the 2024 Gen Z-driven uprising that toppled long-time premier Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts say a clear outcome is crucial for stability in the nation of 175 million, after months of deadly anti-Hasina protests disrupted everyday life and hit major industries, including the garment sector, the world’s second-largest exporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first national election to follow the recent under-30, Gen Z-led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1940849/calls-for-restraint-as-nepali-pm-disappears-after-stepping-down&quot;&gt;uprisings &lt;/a&gt;scattered around the world, with Nepal set to hold a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1948843&quot;&gt;vote &lt;/a&gt;next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting began at 4:30pm (3:30pm PKT) at most booths, immediately after polls closed, with clear trends expected around midnight and results likely to be clear by Friday morning, election commission officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#contest-between-former-allies&quot; id=&quot;contest-between-former-allies&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Contest between former allies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The race pits two coalitions led by former allies, BNP and Jamaat, with opinion polls giving the BNP a slight edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP was leading in 50 seats and Jamaat in 18, local TV news stations said. Bangladesh’s parliament, the Jatiya Sangsad, has 300 seats, with 151 required for a simple majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party declared on its official Facebook page that its chief and prime ministerial candidate Tarique Rahman had won one of two seats he contested. Election authorities were yet to announce the result officially, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP members clapped and cheered loudly as they celebrated outside the party office in Dhaka on hearing the news of his victory, visuals on the Facebook page showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turnout appeared on track to exceed the 42 per cent recorded in the last election in 2024. Local media reported that more than 60pc of registered voters were expected to have cast ballots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hasina’s Awami League is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951958/bangladeshs-sheikh-hasina-warns-of-mass-voter-boycott-as-her-party-barred-from-election&quot;&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt;, and she remains in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, opening the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh as Dhaka’s ties with New Delhi fray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elections under Hasina were frequently marred by boycotts and intimidation, critics say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement sent to journalists on WhatsApp, Hasina denounced the election as a “carefully planned farce”, held without her party and without real voter participation. She said Awami League supporters had rejected the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We demand the cancellation of this voterless, illegal, and unconstitutional election … the removal of the suspension imposed on the activities of the Awami League; and the restoration of the people’s voting rights through the arrangement of a free, fair, and inclusive election under a neutral caretaker government,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside the election, a referendum was held on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and a two-term limit for the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, were on the ballot and at least 50 parties contested — a national record. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were no reports of major violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many voters echoed that sentiment, telling &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the atmosphere felt freer and more festive than in previous elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamal Chowdhury, 31, who works as a driver for a company in Dhaka and travelled to his hometown in the eastern district of Brahmanbaria to cast his vote, said: “It feels festive here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside a polling booth in Dhaka, where BNP chief Rahman and head of the interim government Muhammad Yunus voted, policemen were on horses with saddle blankets proclaiming: “Police are here, vote without fear.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-i-Islami were locked in a tight race on Thursday, early counting showed, after tens of millions of Bangladeshis voted in a pivotal national election — the first since the 2024 Gen Z-driven &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;uprising &lt;/a&gt;that toppled long-time premier Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts say a clear outcome is crucial for stability in the nation of 175 million, after months of deadly anti-Hasina protests disrupted everyday life and hit major industries, including the garment sector, the world’s second-largest exporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first national election to follow the recent under-30, Gen Z-led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1940849/calls-for-restraint-as-nepali-pm-disappears-after-stepping-down&quot;&gt;uprisings &lt;/a&gt;scattered around the world, with Nepal set to hold a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1948843&quot;&gt;vote &lt;/a&gt;next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting began at 4:30pm (3:30pm PKT) at most booths, immediately after polls closed, with clear trends expected around midnight and results likely to be clear by Friday morning, election commission officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race pits two coalitions led by former allies, the BNP and Jamaat, with opinion polls giving the BNP a slight edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP was leading in 10 seats and Jamaat in seven of the nearly 20 seats for which early trends were available, local TV news stations said. Bangladesh’s parliament, the Jatiya Sangsad, has 300 seats, with 151 required for a simple majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turnout appeared on track to exceed the 42 per cent recorded in the last election in 2024. Local media reported that more than 60pc of registered voters were expected to have cast ballots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both prime ministerial candidates — the BNP’s Tarique Rahman and Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman said they were confident of winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two men are not related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am confident of winning the election. There is enthusiasm among the people about the vote,” Tarique Rahman told reporters, while the Jamaat’s Shafiqur Rahman called the election a “turning point” for Bangladesh and said the people were eager for change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the election, a referendum was held on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and a two-term limit for the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, were on the ballot and at least 50 parties contested — a national record. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were no reports of major violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many voters echoed that sentiment, telling &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the atmosphere felt freer and more festive than in previous elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamal Chowdhury, 31, who works as a driver for a company in Dhaka and travelled to his hometown in the eastern district of Brahmanbaria to cast his vote, said: “It feels festive here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside a polling booth in Dhaka, where BNP chief Rahman and head of the interim government Muhammad Yunus voted, policemen were on horses with saddle blankets proclaiming: “Police are here, vote without fear.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>DHAKA — Polling for Bangladesh’s 13th national parliamentary elections has concluded, and vote counting has begun across the country. The elections follow an 18-month student-led movement that ended Sheikh Hasina’s two-decade rule. The results will determine control of the 300 directly elected seats in the Jatiya Sangsad. Tough competition is expected between alliances led by [&amp;#8230;]</description>

      <title>Counting under way in landmark Bangladesh elections after Gen Z revolution</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/counting-under-way-in-landmark-bangladesh-elections-after-gen-z-revolution</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Counting was under way on Thursday in Bangladesh’s first election since a deadly 2024 uprising and the subsequent student-led revolution, with powerful political heir &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; bullish about defeating a coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 60-year-old said he was “confident” his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — which was crushed during the 15 years of ousted premier Sheikh Hasina’s autocratic rule — can regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he faces a stiff challenge from a coalition led by Jamaat-i-Islami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commission officials reported “a few minor disruptions” but top party leaders on both sides raised fears of threats, with the BNP’s Rahman calling on people to vote so that “conspiracies will not succeed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign, hoping to form the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat, which has campaigned on a platform of justice and ending corruption, senses its biggest opportunity in decades, with party leader Shafiqur saying it “will do whatever is required” to ensure a fair result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The early results indicate something positive”, the Jamaat chief said, as counting continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP’s Tarique has said he is “confident” of victory, and his adviser said the party would “secure a sweeping victory”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many opinion polls give the BNP the lead, although some suggest a knife-edge race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polls closed at 4:30pm (3:30 PKT), with the first significant results potentially expected overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#polling&quot; id=&quot;polling&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Polling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, voters lined up outside polling stations in Dhaka in the hugely anticipated election, while key party leaders raised fears of threats or “conspiracies” to derail the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But “if people in Bangladesh come out to cast their votes, conspiracies will not succeed”, Tarique said after voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With around 128m people eligible to vote, turnout reached a high 32.88 per cent by noon at about three-fourths of the 42,651 polling centres across the country, Akhtar Ahmed, senior secretary of the Election Commission, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no reports of major violence, but a BNP leader died in a scuffle outside a polling booth in the coastal town of Khulna, and two paramilitary personnel and a 13-year old girl were injured when a home-made bomb exploded outside a polling booth in Hasina’s stronghold of Gopalganj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country on election day, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was my first vote,” said Shithi Goswami, 21, a student at Dhaka City College. “I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UN experts warned ahead of voting of “growing intolerance, threats and attacks”, and a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972525&quot;&gt;tsunami of disinformation&lt;/a&gt;”, especially targeting millions of young first-time voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls vary widely, though most give the BNP the lead — with some suggesting a knife-edge race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During campaigning, political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600, police records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin said the vote was going “smoothly in a free and fair manner”, with “a few minor disruptions” — noting the main threat was a flood of disinformation on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;Muhammad Yunus&lt;/a&gt;, who will step down once the new government takes power, has said the vote “will determine the future direction of the country”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led the South Asian nation since Hasina’s 15-year rule ended with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;her ouster&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His administration has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951958/bangladeshs-sheikh-hasina-warns-of-mass-voter-boycott-as-her-party-barred-from-election&quot;&gt;barred her&lt;/a&gt; Awami League party from contesting the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, 78, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; in absentia for crimes against humanity for the bloody crackdown on protesters during her final months in power, and remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus, speaking after voting, said that the country had “ended the nightmare and begun a new dream”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#spirit-of-the-uprising&quot; id=&quot;spirit-of-the-uprising&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Spirit of the uprising’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 127m voters were also voting in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972702/why-is-bangladesh-holding-a-national-referendum-alongside-its-general-election&quot;&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; on whether to endorse proposals for prime-ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeasin Arafat Emon, 25, said he had backed the charter as it “reflects the spirit of the uprising”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters will elect 300 lawmakers directly, with a further 50 women chosen from party lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several voters were conflicted about participating in the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some are determined to cast their ballots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. “Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next government will inherit a battered economy in the world’s second-largest garment exporter, as well as delicate relations with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s Tarique — whose late parents both led the country — told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; ahead of the vote that his first priority, if elected, would be restoring security and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he warned the challenges ahead were immense, and that “the economy has been destroyed”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PM Shehbaz to attend inaugural Board of Peace meeting in US, confirms FO</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972727/pm-shehbaz-to-attend-inaugural-board-of-peace-meeting-in-us-confirms-fo</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi confirmed on Thursday that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting in the US, saying that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar would also accompany him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrabi’s confirmation follows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972442&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that said PM Shehbaz was expected to visit Washington on February 18 and represent Pakistan at the first meeting of US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace, which is scheduled for Feb 19 at the US Institute of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can confirm that the prime minister will attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting. He will be accompanied by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister,” Andrabi said during a weekly briefing of the FO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that information about other members of Pakistan’s delegation and its engagements would be shared in due course of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked specifically whether Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir would be included in the delegation, the FO spokesperson reiterated: “We will share these details in due course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do not have the details — neither on the itinerary, nor on the composition of the delegation. I can confirm that the prime minister will lead the delegation and that the deputy prime minister and foreign minister will be part of the delegation. This is the extent of information right now. We will, of course, update you in due course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is among the 14 countries that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968339&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; the charter of the Board of Peace on January 22 on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, becoming a founding member of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board was initially proposed in September 2025 and formally established last month. Under its charter, the US government serves as its official depository. President Trump has designated the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington as the board’s headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November 2025 authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to establish an international stabilisation force in Gaza following a ceasefire that began in October under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the ceasefire has remained fragile, with repeated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971789&quot;&gt;violations&lt;/a&gt; by Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Trump’s Gaza plan unveiled late last year, the Board of Peace was originally intended to supervise Gaza’s temporary governance following a ceasefire, before being expanded to address global conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rights experts and scholars have, however,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965054&quot;&gt; criticised the concept&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that a US-led board overseeing the affairs of a foreign territory resembles a colonial structure. The absence of Palestinian representation on the board has further deepened these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A journalist also pointed out during the FO briefing on Thursday that there was no representation from Gaza on the board. Highlighting US support for Israel as well, the journalist asked: “How reliable would this Board of Peace prove to be for the people of Gaza?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his response, Andrabi said, “We have joined the Board of Peace in good faith, as I highlighted in my previous briefing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also pointed that Pakistan had not joined the board in isolation and not as “one voice, but as collective voice of eight Islamic-Arab countries”, which had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1944220&quot;&gt;worked with Trump&lt;/a&gt; on his Gaza plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our collective voice is resonating in the Board of Peace, and we will continue to strive for the rights, peace and prosperity of the people of Palestine, aimed at the long-term solution of the Palestine issue — to create a state of Palestine, in accordance with the pre-1967 border with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, our engagement is both for short-term, medium-term and long-term solution of the plight of the Palestinian people,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972698/israel-has-joined-trumps-board-of-peace-netanyahu-says&quot;&gt;Israel joining the board&lt;/a&gt;, the FO spokesperson said: “It is their decision. We are not obliged to offer any comment. We will engage with the Board of Peace with positivity of intent, and as I said, our prime minister will attend the Board of Peace meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#shot-down-a-number-of-indian-rafale-jets&quot; id=&quot;shot-down-a-number-of-indian-rafale-jets&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Shot down a number of Indian Rafale jets’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrabi was also asked for a clarification following Trump’s recent remarks that 10 aircraft were shot down during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509&quot;&gt;four-day conflict&lt;/a&gt; between India and Pakistan in May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 months, the US president has stated numerous times that aircraft were shot down during the conflict — albeit without specifying whose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially stating that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;five jets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were shot down, Trump gradually raised that number to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951783&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;seven in October&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1953444&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;eight in November&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to the question on Trump’s statement, the FO spokesperson said: “We have stated it previously, and I wish to reiterate it here that Pakistan is appreciative of the role of the United States during our 90-hour war with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The role of the United States was for peace, for prevention of war and prevention of violence. So, in that context, President Trump’s statements, previous statements, and these statements are all obviously welcomed and endorsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As regards the fighter planes: this is a matter of history,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Pakistan shot down “a number of Indian Rafale jets, and the evidence is all over — available internationally, corroborated by international reports, including by the manufacturers of these planes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This demonstrated that Pakistan was able to deter Indian aggression through conventional means. This is also an indicator for the future — any future Indian aggression would be dealt forthrightly and forcefully with all our resources,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#weaponisation-of-cricket-is-regrettable&quot; id=&quot;weaponisation-of-cricket-is-regrettable&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Weaponisation of cricket is regrettable’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the session, the FO spokesperson was asked whether Pakistan’s decision to play the T20 World Cup match against India after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;announcing &lt;/a&gt;an initial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott &lt;/a&gt;was the consequence of back-channel cricket diplomacy between the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Andrabi said: “Cricket is a game that we all love and we all cherish. We grew up playing this game. Weaponisation of cricket, politicisation of cricket is regrettable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that the government’s decision to not play against India “reflected the resolve of the government of Pakistan to not let cricket be weaponised and politicised”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our subsequent decision to play reflected our magnanimity, after the relevant cricket authorities realised that they had weaponised and politicised cricket, particularly weaponised against Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As you are aware, the Bangladesh side and Sri Lankan side (host of this game) were in touch with our government and cricket board,” he highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So the decision to play the game, is reflective of the magnanimity shown by our prime minister as a result of contacts made by the brotherly countries of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as well as by a realisation within the relevant authorities managing cricket internationally and in India, that weaponisation and politicisation of cricket is wrong, is unwarranted, and it defies the spirit of the beloved game of cricket that we all cherish,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Risk of Nipah spread low after cases in India, Bangladesh: WHO</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972723/risk-of-nipah-spread-low-after-cases-in-india-bangladesh-who</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organisation has said the risk of the deadly Nipah virus spreading was low after three cases of infection were recently confirmed in India and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nipah, which spreads from animals to humans, has no vaccine and a fatality rate ranging from 40 to 75 per cent, according to the UN health body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past few weeks, three cases of Nipah — two in India and one in Bangladesh — made headlines and caused concern about a wider outbreak,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO assessed the risk of spread of the Nipah virus regionally and globally and found it low, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two cases of Nipah were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969509&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; last month in India’s West Bengal state, while one patient died in Bangladesh last week after contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two outbreaks were not related, although both occurred along the India-Bangladesh border, and share some of the same ecological and cultural conditions, as well as populations of the species of fruit bat that are known to be the natural reservoir of Nipah virus,” Tedros said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#indian-nurse-infected-with-nipah-virus-dies&quot; id=&quot;indian-nurse-infected-with-nipah-virus-dies&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Indian nurse infected with Nipah virus dies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, an Indian health worker who contracted the Nipah virus in December has died, a senior health official from the eastern state of West Bengal said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman — a nurse — was one of two people in the state who were infected and was being treated at a local hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The woman … who was critical, died due to cardiac arrest,” Health Secretary Narayan Swaroop Nigam told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nipah was first identified in 1998 after it spread among pig farmers in Malaysia. In India, the first Nipah outbreak was reported in West Bengal in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, at least 17 people died from Nipah in Kerala, and in 2023, two people died from the virus in the same southern Indian state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include intense fever, vomiting and a respiratory infection, but severe cases can involve seizures and brain inflammation that results in a coma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh elections: Islamist-led coalition hopes for chance at power</title>
      <link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/focus/20260212-bangladesh-elections-islamist-led-coalition-hopes-for-chance-at-power</link>
      <description>Bangladesh has held its first elections since a student revolution deposed autocratic leader Sheikh Hasina in 2024. Hasina&apos;s main rival, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is now projected to win. Yet the biggest development is the resurgence of the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, which was banned under Hasina. Minorities targeted in recent mob violence and some women now fear for their rights. FRANCE 24&apos;s Navodita Kumari, Alban Alvarez and Muktadir Rashid report.</description>

      <title>Counting begins in landmark Bangladesh elections after Gen Z revolution</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/counting-begins-in-landmark-bangladesh-elections-after-gen-z-revolution</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Counting began on Thursday in Bangladesh’s first election since a deadly 2024 uprising and the subsequent student-led revolution, with powerful political heir &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; bullish about defeating a coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters lined up outside polling stations in Dhaka in the hugely anticipated election, while key party leaders have raised fears of threats or “conspiracies” to derail the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, 60, said he was “confident” his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) could regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he faces a stiff challenge from a coalition led by the Muslim-majority country’s Jamaat-i-Islami party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If people in Bangladesh come out to cast their votes, conspiracies will not succeed,” Tarique said after voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polls closed at 4:30pm (3:30 PKT), with the first significant results potentially expected overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With around 128m people eligible to vote, turnout reached a high 32.88 per cent by noon at about three-fourths of the 42,651 polling centres across the country, Akhtar Ahmed, senior secretary of the Election Commission, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no reports of major violence, but a BNP leader died in a scuffle outside a polling booth in the coastal town of Khulna, and two paramilitary personnel and a 13-year old girl were injured when a home-made bomb exploded outside a polling booth in Hasina’s stronghold of Gopalganj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country on election day, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commission officials reported “a few minor disruptions” but top party leaders on both sides raised fears of threats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was my first vote,” said Shithi Goswami, 21, a student at Dhaka City College. “I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat, who have campaigned on a platform of justice and ending corruption, sense their biggest opportunity in decades, with party leader Rahman saying it “will do whatever is required” to ensure a fair result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UN experts warned ahead of voting of “growing intolerance, threats and attacks”, and a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972525&quot;&gt;tsunami of disinformation&lt;/a&gt;”, especially targeting millions of young first-time voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#ended-the-nightmare&quot; id=&quot;ended-the-nightmare&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Ended the nightmare’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls vary widely, though most give the BNP the lead — with some suggesting a knife-edge race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During campaigning, political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600, police records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin said the vote was going “smoothly in a free and fair manner”, with “a few minor disruptions” — noting the main threat was a flood of disinformation on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;Muhammad Yunus&lt;/a&gt;, who will step down once the new government takes power, has said the vote “will determine the future direction of the country”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led the South Asian nation since Hasina’s 15-year rule ended with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;her ouster&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His administration has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951958/bangladeshs-sheikh-hasina-warns-of-mass-voter-boycott-as-her-party-barred-from-election&quot;&gt;barred her&lt;/a&gt; Awami League party from contesting the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, 78, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; in absentia for crimes against humanity for the bloody crackdown on protesters during her final months in power, and remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus, speaking after voting, said that the country had “ended the nightmare and begun a new dream”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#spirit-of-the-uprising&quot; id=&quot;spirit-of-the-uprising&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Spirit of the uprising’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 127m voters were also voting in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972702/why-is-bangladesh-holding-a-national-referendum-alongside-its-general-election&quot;&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; on whether to endorse proposals for prime-ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeasin Arafat Emon, 25, said he had backed the charter as it “reflects the spirit of the uprising”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters will elect 300 lawmakers directly, with a further 50 women chosen from party lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several voters were conflicted about participating in the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some are determined to cast their ballots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. “Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next government will inherit a battered economy in the world’s second-largest garment exporter, as well as delicate relations with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s Tarique — whose late parents both led the country — told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; ahead of the vote that his first priority, if elected, would be restoring security and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he warned the challenges ahead were immense, and that “the economy has been destroyed”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladesh is holding its first parliamentary elections since the ousting of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024, with voters electing 300 lawmakers directly and 50 women from party lists. The main contenders are the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Islamist-led Jamaat coalition, as Hasina’s Awami Party has been barred from participating.</description>

      <title>High turnout as Bangladeshis vote in landmark election after Gen Z revolution</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/high-turnout-as-bangladeshis-vote-in-landmark-election-after-gen-z-revolution</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh voted on Thursday in its first election since a deadly 2024 uprising, as parties crushed under Sheikh Hasina’s rule return to the fray with a powerful political heir facing a coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters lined up outside polling stations in Dhaka in the hugely anticipated election, while key party leaders have raised fears of threats or “conspiracies” to derail the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With around 128 million people eligible to vote, turnout reached a high 32.88 per cent by noon at about three-fourths of the 42,651 polling centres across the country, Akhtar Ahmed, senior secretary of the Election Commission, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 300,000 soldiers and police are deployed countrywide, with UN experts warning ahead of voting of “growing intolerance, threats and attacks”, and a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972525&quot;&gt;tsunami of disinformation&lt;/a&gt;”, especially targeting millions of young first-time voters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was my first vote,” said Shithi Goswami, 21, a student at Dhaka City College. “I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading prime ministerial hopeful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, 60, said he was “confident” his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) could regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he faces a stiff challenge from a coalition led by the Muslim-majority country’s Jamaat-i-Islami party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If people in Bangladesh come out to cast their votes, conspiracies will not succeed,” Tarique said after voting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat, who have campaigned on a platform of justice and ending corruption, sense their biggest opportunity in decades, with party leader Rahman saying it “will do whatever is required” to ensure a fair result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls vary widely, though most give the BNP the lead — with some suggesting a knife-edge race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During campaigning, political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600, police records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin said the vote was going “smoothly in a free and fair manner”, with “a few minor disruptions” — noting the main threat was a flood of disinformation on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voters will elect 300 lawmakers directly, with a further 50 women chosen from party lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting by hand begins after polls close at 4:30pm (3:30pm PKT), with first significant results expected potentially overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several voters are conflicted about participating in the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next government will inherit a battered economy in the world’s second-largest garment exporter, as well as delicate relations with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s Tarique — whose late parents both led the country — told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; ahead of the vote that his first priority, if elected, would be restoring security and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he warned the challenges ahead were immense, and that “the economy has been destroyed”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A hand grenade exploded at a polling station in Bangladesh’s Gopalganj district, injuring three people during national elections. The attack heightened security concerns as voters cast ballots in a closely contested parliamentary race. Election staff, voters, and local residents were directly affected by the explosion.

      <title>Bangladesh votes in landmark polls after Gen Z revolution</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/bangladesh-votes-in-landmark-polls-after-gen-z-revolution</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh voted on Thursday in its first election since a deadly 2024 uprising, as parties crushed under Sheikh Hasina’s rule return to the fray with a powerful political heir facing a coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters lined up outside polling stations in Dhaka in the hugely anticipated election, while key party leaders have raised fears of threats or “conspiracies” to derail the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 300,000 soldiers and police are deployed countrywide, with UN experts warning ahead of voting of “growing intolerance, threats and attacks”, and a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972525&quot;&gt;tsunami of disinformation&lt;/a&gt;”, especially targeting millions of young first-time voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was my first vote,” said Shithi Goswami, 21, a student at Dhaka City College. “I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading prime ministerial hopeful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, 60, said he was “confident” his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) could regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he faces a stiff challenge from a coalition led by the Muslim-majority country’s Jamaat-i-Islami party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If people in Bangladesh come out to cast their votes, conspiracies will not succeed,” Tarique said after voting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat, who have campaigned on a platform of justice and ending corruption, sense their biggest opportunity in decades, with party leader Rahman saying it “will do whatever is required” to ensure a fair result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#ended-the-nightmare&quot; id=&quot;ended-the-nightmare&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Ended the nightmare’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls vary widely, though most give the BNP the lead — with some suggesting a knife-edge race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During campaigning, political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600, police records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin said the vote was going “smoothly in a free and fair manner”, with “a few minor disruptions” — noting the main threat was a flood of disinformation on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;Muhammad Yunus&lt;/a&gt;, who will step down once the new government takes power, has said the vote “will determine the future direction of the country”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led the South Asian nation since Hasina’s 15-year rule ended with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;her ouster&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His administration has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951958/bangladeshs-sheikh-hasina-warns-of-mass-voter-boycott-as-her-party-barred-from-election&quot;&gt;barred her&lt;/a&gt; Awami League party from contesting the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, 78, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; in absentia for crimes against humanity for the bloody crackdown on protesters during her final months in power, and remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus, speaking after voting, said that the country had “ended the nightmare and begun a new dream”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#spirit-of-the-uprising&quot; id=&quot;spirit-of-the-uprising&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Spirit of the uprising’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 127m voters are also voting in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972702/why-is-bangladesh-holding-a-national-referendum-alongside-its-general-election&quot;&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; on whether to endorse proposals for prime-ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeasin Arafat Emon, 25, said he had backed the charter as it “reflects the spirit of the uprising”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters will elect 300 lawmakers directly, with a further 50 women chosen from party lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting by hand begins after polls close at 4:30pm (3:30pm PKT), with first significant results expected potentially overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several voters are conflicted about participating in the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some are determined to cast their ballots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. “Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh votes in its first election since the 2024 Gen Z uprising that ousted Hasina</title>

      <description>Voters across Bangladesh are casting ballots in a parliamentary election seen as a key test for the country’s democracy after years of political unrest. More than 127 million people are eligible to vote in the first election since former prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s government collapsed in 2024 following mass protests often described as a Gen Z-led uprising. Results are expected on Friday, as FRANCE 24&apos;s Navodita Kumari explains.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshis head to the polls on Thursday, with nearly 128 million people eligible to vote, in a key test of the country’s return to democracy after a popular uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;long-time leader Sheikh Hasina in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent opinion poll by the Dhaka-based Communication Research Foundation and Bangladesh Elections and Public Opinion Studies found corruption to be voters’ top concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh has long ranked among the world’s worst performers in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the frontrunning Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its main rival Jamaat-i-Islami, have made tackling graft central to their campaigns, with Jamaat’s anti-corruption image helping fuel its resurgence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladesh&apos;s upcoming general election marks a historic absence for the Awami League. For the first time in three decades, the party&apos;s boat symbol will not be on the ballot. This follows the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024 after widespread protests. The Awami League&apos;s registration remains suspended, preventing its participation.</description>

      <title>Why is Bangladesh holding a national referendum alongside its general election?</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972702/why-is-bangladesh-holding-a-national-referendum-alongside-its-general-election</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will hold a national referendum on Thursday together with its first parliamentary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/bangladesh-votes-in-landmark-election-after-gen-z-revolution&quot;&gt;election&lt;/a&gt; since violent protests &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ousted&lt;/a&gt; former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referendum will give people a chance to vote on reforms to state institutions. Here is a look at why the referendum is being held, and what it entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#why-is-a-referendum-needed&quot; id=&quot;why-is-a-referendum-needed&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Why is a referendum needed?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referendum focuses on implementing the ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1949661&quot;&gt;July Charter&lt;/a&gt;’ drafted after the 2024 uprising to establish good governance, democracy, and social justice through institutional reforms, and to prevent “recurrence of authoritarian and fascist rule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interim government that took power after Hasina’s ouster approved the charter’s implementation order in November, saying public approval was necessary for key changes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Voters stand in the queue to cast their vote at a polling station during the 13th general election in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 12, 2026. &amp;mdash; Reuters&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/12110642e45c637.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#what-are-people-voting-on&quot; id=&quot;what-are-people-voting-on&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What are people voting on?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters will decide on four major reforms, including the creation of new constitutional bodies and the introduction of a bicameral parliament, whose upper house majority approval shall be needed for constitutional amendments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other questions cover the implementation of 30 charter reforms — including term limits for prime ministers and enhanced presidential powers, along with broader changes in line with political parties’ commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#how-is-the-referendum-being-held&quot; id=&quot;how-is-the-referendum-being-held&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How is the referendum being held?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each person will cast their vote by secret ballot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a majority votes in favour, a Constitutional Reform Council will be formed to complete the reforms within 180 working days from its first session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh held three referendums before the Hasina government abolished the provision in 2011. A High Court reinstated it in 2024 after she was ousted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the 1977 and 1985 referendums asked people if they had confidence in the then-presidents and their policies, the third, in 1991, asked whether Bangladesh should return from a presidential system to parliamentary democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People overwhelmingly voted “yes” in all three referendums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#what-do-critics-say&quot; id=&quot;what-do-critics-say&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What do critics say?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referendum has been criticised for denying voters the chance to decide on reforms individually, instead clubbing together multiple proposals to force a single yes-or-no answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics say this confuses voters by presenting a complicated premise and limits their ability to properly understand and debate the reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interim government and political parties have also drawn criticism for framing a “yes” vote as essential, which critics say shrinks space for dissent by implying voting “no” means rejecting reform altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh votes in landmark election after Gen Z revolution</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/bangladesh-votes-in-landmark-election-after-gen-z-revolution</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshis lined up outside polling booths on Thursday as voting began for what many say is a pivotal election for the South Asian nation, marking a return to democracy after the 2024 ouster of long-time premier Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-driven uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts say a decisive result is crucial for steady governance in the nation of 175 million, as the deadly anti-Hasina protests triggered months of unrest and disrupted key industries, including the garments sector, the worlds second-largest exporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party leader Shafiqur Rahman reacts after casting his vote at a polling station during Bangladesh&amp;rsquo;s general election in Dhaka on February 12, 2026. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/large/2026/02/12093305ef40384.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami party leader Shafiqur Rahman reacts after casting his vote at a polling station during Bangladesh’s general election in Dhaka on February 12, 2026. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contest pits two coalitions led by former allies, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami, with opinion polls giving an edge to the BNP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina’s Awami League is banned, and she remains in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, opening the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh as Dhaka’s ties with New Delhi deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous elections marred by opposition boycotts and intimidation, more than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, are vying for 300 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting in one constituency has been postponed due to the death of a candidate. At least 50 parties are contesting in total, a national record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This election is not just another routine vote, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, head of an interim government installed after Hasinas ouster, said this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public awakening we witnessed against long-standing anger, inequality, deprivation and injustice finds its constitutional expression in this election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, there will be a referendum on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and imposing a two-term limit on the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the crowded field and expectations of a close race, the campaign period remained largely peaceful, barring a few incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucial test for Bangladesh now will be to ensure the election is conducted fairly and impartially, and for all parties to then accept the result, said Thomas Kean, a senior consultant with the International Crisis Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that happens, it will be the strongest evidence yet that Bangladesh has indeed embarked on a period of democratic renewal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On election day, more than 100,000 soldiers from the army, navy and air force will assist nearly 200,000 police in maintaining law and order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#early-start-late-finish&quot; id=&quot;early-start-late-finish&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Early start, late finish&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polling opened at 7:30am (0230 GMT) and closes at 4:30pm. Counting will begin soon after, with early trends expected around midnight and results likely to be clear by Friday morning, Election Commission officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 128 million people are registered to vote, 49% of them women. But only 83 female candidates are contesting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corruption and inflation are the biggest issues among voters, a recent survey found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two prime ministerial candidates are the BNP’s Tarique Rahman and Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman. They are not related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several voters are conflicted about participating in the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some are determined to cast their ballots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. “Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#president-zardari-hopes-for-peaceful-process&quot; id=&quot;president-zardari-hopes-for-peaceful-process&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;President Zardari hopes for peaceful process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COMMENT: After political win, Pakistan team must deliver against India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972637/comment-after-political-win-pakistan-team-must-deliver-against-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;NOTHING is certain in life, wrote Benjamin Franklin, except death and taxes. He was wrong. There is one other certainty in life, and that is a Pakistan-India match at an ICC tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This truism was close to being debunked this year, but the bountiful stars aligned to deliver us a contest that is — to borrow a phrase from a leading Chinese car-maker — beyond your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the match is bigger than ever and a focal point of international attention. Pakistan is resurgent on the field; the progression in performance is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has created a mini-political earthquake off the back of the ‘un-boycott’, as it were. The question is whether Pakistan can back up its political game on the cricket field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country must set out a longer-term strategy that can maximise commercial value of its 200 million population, and turn its erratic team into one of the world’s strongest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘un-boycott’ gave each interested party something to walk away with. Bangladesh will not be punished; on the contrary, it is being rewarded with an ICC tournament of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has secured its cricketing border with Pakistan and satisfied its bankers. Pakistan stood up for Bangladesh, avoided harming its enduring ally Sri Lanka, and extracted some positive rhetoric from the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some argue that the boycott was never a serious one; just a piece of elaborate theatre. Others insist that the PCB has exposed what is rotten in the state of international cricket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India may think itself an emperor of cricket, believe others, but it is now ruler without a Lunghi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#indias-questionable-leadership&quot; id=&quot;indias-questionable-leadership&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India’s ‘questionable leadership’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the euphoria, it also important to examine Pakistan’s concrete gains from the boycott threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that India always held the whip hand, being the most financially powerful cricket board in the world. That power allows it to control international cricket through the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world’s other so-called leading cricket nations, notably England and Australia, all bend the knee to India. Money talks, cricket walks, and integrity is benched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan took the Bangladesh opportunity to draw attention to India’s malign rule of international cricket. Its options were few and it had little support; only holding the trump cards of either withdrawing from the tournament, or refusing to play against India in the $200m contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan spoke openly about India’s unjust domination of international cricket — a reality that everybody knows, but nobody dares to speak up about. Perhaps triggering the conversation is an achievement in itself, but in concrete terms, Pakistan hasn’t gained much here, although it may stand to reap benefits later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking more positively, talks are now promised about fairer distribution of tournament revenue among states. Those talks might also deliver some future concessions — albeit unspecified — in Pakistan’s favour. That would be a good outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another talking point is the restoration of bilateral series between Pakistan and India. This would be a veritable win and India has no credible argument to oppose it, other than its domestic populist politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is clearly in the wrong, and the outcome of those deliberations will deliver a definitive verdict on the credibility of India’s leadership of this international sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#what-pakistan-must-do-next&quot; id=&quot;what-pakistan-must-do-next&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Pakistan must do next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan may have not won this battle outright, but it might yet make advances in the war. However, the country has now restored its financial prospects by fulfilling its commitments in relation to the ICC tournament. It also pays due reverence to co-host Sri Lanka, who have unfailingly stood by Pakistan’s side through decades of struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we also come away confirming is that the strategy for Pakistan, if it seeks real change, remains two-pronged. You can only hold sway in the world of cricket if you sit on a lucrative commercial market, or if your team is one of the most powerful – ideally both. That is the strategy the PCB must pursue, but is one that was never seriously adopted before, because of politics and short-termism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways this scenario ends up well for Pakistan. First, if the ICC does make changes and offers concessions after the tournament — this is, admittedly, a long shot. Negotiations will need to take place, and perhaps by maintaining a firm position against India’s twisted rule of international cricket, momentum and support for genuine change will grow among other nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Pakistan must grit its teeth and do some hard thinking to set out a longer-term strategy that will lead to maximising the commercial value of its 200 million population, and at the same time turn its erratic, and sometimes disappointing, team into one of the world’s strongest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be no compromise on either of these strategic agendas — and Pakistan can begin this new era by defeating India in Sri Lanka on Feb 15. Pakistan needs a big performance to back up its big rhetoric. This is the time; this is the hour — and a victory against India would certainly be an outcome beyond the recent dreams of Pakistan’s supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh heads to pivotal election amid economic strain</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972598/bangladesh-heads-to-pivotal-election-amid-economic-strain</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Jobs, governance and the freedom to speak without fear top the priorities of Bangladesh’s Gen Z voters as the South Asian country heads into a national election called after a student-led uprising in 2024&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt; toppled&lt;/a&gt; longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday’s vote is considered the Muslim-majority nation’s first competitive election since 2009, even though Hasina’s Awami League party has been barred from contesting as the Election Commission has suspended its registration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decisive result is critical for restoring stability in the nation of 175 million after months of unrest that has disrupted major industries, including the garments sector in the worlds second-largest exporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 28pc of Bangladesh’s population is between the ages of 15-29, or from Gen Z, according to government estimates from 2022. After taking a leading role in Hasina’s 2024 ouster, these youngsters are expected to come out in large numbers to vote, and their choices could be crucial in a close contest. But there has been no major reform in the interim, and no viable alternative party has emerged, according to many, leaving the battle for government mostly between frontrunners Bang­ladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Islamist Jamaat-e-Isl­a­mi, both established parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen Z voters hope for job creation and improvement in governance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This election comes from the July (2024) movement,” said Farhan Sadik, 20. “If candidates think they can do politics the old way, that wont work.” A youth-driven party born out of the country’s 2024 uprising has joined Jamaat in a coalition; however most analysts expect BNP to win. Shakil Ahmed, a government and politics professor at Jahangirnagar University, said young voters were “looking for a new political class to take charge”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since the newly formed party has not provided a broad-based political platform, the BNP is expected to be their preferred choice.” Asif Shahan, a professor at the University of Dhaka, however said Gen Z voters were likely to back Jamaat. “It may not be decisive, but it will certainly give Jamaat a significant boost, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Law and order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen Z voters said their main issues were job opportunities and political freedom. “I expect the new government to understand young job seekers like me,” said Monika Akter, 24, from Bogura district who will vote for the first time. “We need a fair and transparent recruitment and exam process. Especially National University graduates — we suffer the most.” Mohammed Muniruzzaman, 21, added: “About 86pc of National University students are unemployed — that’s really painful. We don’t want to finish our studies and remain jobless. We need IT-based education so we can compete globally.” National University is a public institution that runs over 2,200 colleges across Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom of expression — which critics say was sharply curtailed under Hasina — is another defining issue. “We couldn’t speak freely during the fascist period,” said journalist Mohammed Saimum Jahan, 22. “Whoever comes to power, we need freedom of speech even to criticise the government.” In rural areas, Gen Z voters were focused more on bread and butter issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We spend a lot on seeds and fertiliser, but when we sell vegetables, we don’t get a fair rate,” said Farhana Akhter, 21, from a farming family in Bogura. “We don’t expect miracles in one day, but we hope things improve step by step.” Some young voters said they were turning toward parties they believe can deliver locally, rather than the BNP or Jamaat.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pacer Naseem Shah sold for Rs86.5m in highest bid at first-ever PSL player auction</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first-ever player auction for the 11th edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) was held in Lahore on Wednesday, with fast bowler Naseem Shah sold to Rawalpindi for Rs86.5 million — the highest bid of the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction ended after several unsold players were snapped up by the eight franchises. Earlier rounds of bidding saw major players auctioned off, including Fakhar Zaman, David Warner and Muhammad Amir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967839&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The auction began with bidding on all-rounders, starting with Faheem Ashraf at the base price of Rs42m, with Islamabad United putting in the final bid at Rs85m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also scored New Zealand cricketer Mark Chapman after they bid Rs70m against Peshawar Zalmi’s Rs68.5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohammad Waseem Jr joined the team at the winning bid of Rs41m — a marked increase from his base price at 22m — against Quetta Gladiators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team secured Mir Hamza Sajjad as well at a winning bid of Rs7m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamabad United also bagged Sameer Minhas at the bid of Rs19m after back-and-forth bidding against Quetta Gladiators. Sameen Gul also joined the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-rounder Imad Wasim, who was unsold in the prior rounds of bidding, was secured for Rs22m. He was followed by England’s Richard Gleeson, who was snapped up with an Rs11m bid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batter Haider Ali was secured for Rs15m after back-and-forth bidding with Sialkot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hyderabad and Lahore bid for bowler Mohammad Hasnain, before the latter bowed out and Islamabad United joined the fray. Hyderabad dropped out of the race, with Hasnain secured by Islamabad for Rs7.75m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s Nahid Rana and batter Miraz Tahir Baig were snapped up for their base price of Rs6m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the auction ceremony’s conclusion, the franchise made an official announcement that Kashif Ali, from their player development programme, would be part of their squad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#hyderabad-houston-kingsmen&quot; id=&quot;hyderabad-houston-kingsmen&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hyderabad Houston Kingsmen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The newly introduced Hyderabad Houston Kingsmen in a last-minute bid of Rs21.5m bought fast-bowler Mohammad Ali against Rawalpindi’s Rs20.5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also secured Hassan Khan at the winning bid of Rs18.5m after back-and-forth rounds of bidding with Quetta Gladiators and Lahore Qalandars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shayan Jahangir also joined the team. The Kingsmen acquired Ottneil Baartman at Rs11m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian fast bowler Riley Meredith was snapped up for Rs42m after the break, having previously been unsold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The franchise secured several players at their base price of Rs6m, including left-handed batter Sharjeel Khan, all-rounder Asif Mehmood, bowler Hunain Shah and batters Saad Ali, Mohammad Tayyab Arif and Rizwan Mehmood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the team includes Saim Ayub, Marnus Labuschagne, Usman Khan, Maaz Sadaqat, Hassan Khan, Shayan Jahangir, Kusal Perara, Irfan Khan Niazi, Mohammad Ali, Otteneil Baartman, Hammad Azam and Akif Javed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#many-players-unsold&quot; id=&quot;many-players-unsold&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Many players unsold&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the auction began, Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz was auctioned at the base price of Rs11m, however, no bids were made by any of the teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;England’s David Willey remained unsold as well, while batter Shaan Masood also received no bids. All-rounder William Sutherland — at the base price of 42m — received no bids either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Sri Lankan cricketer Dinesh Chandimal, England’s Chris Jordan and Muhammad Hasnain also went unsold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the 90-minute recess, Australia’s Usman Khawaja and New Zealand’s Jimmy Neesham and Bangladesh legend Shakib Al Hasan were among the players still unsold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the ceremony, PSL Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Salman Naseer addressed the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the HBL PSL X ended, and the euphoria died down a little, and we looked ahead at the path in front of us, all commercial contracts had come to an end…monumental challenges lay ahead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PSL and PCB teams have burned midnight oil day in and day out to get us where we are today,” Naseer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCB, in a statement issued today, said that over 800 players have registered for the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the cricket board shared the base prices for players, with the top bracket set at Rs42 million (platinum), followed by Rs22m (diamond), Rs11m (gold), and Rs6m (silver and emerging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1.5m for bid amounts above Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above-mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad will have a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”, while the number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh heads to the polls on February 12, 2026, in its first national election since Sheikh Hasina’s 2024 ouster, marking the end of an 18‑month transition under Muhammad Yunus.  

Nearly 127 million voters will choose a new government and decide on the July Charter, a sweeping set of constitutional reforms.  With the Awami League banned, the contest is led by the BNP and a Jamaat‑NCP bloc, in an election that could redefine Bangladesh’s political future.</description>

      <title>Why playing India is the smartest decision PCB has made in months</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972538/why-playing-india-is-the-smartest-decision-pcb-has-made-in-months</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In international cricket, principle is often loud, emotional and instantly gratifying. Strategy, on the other hand, is quieter, slower, and frequently misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;eventually agree to play India &lt;/a&gt;on February 15 falls squarely in the latter category, and despite the initial optics, it is the right call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic boycott call did what it needed to do early on. It created noise, unsettled the International Cricket Council (ICC), and earned Pakistan something it has been desperately short of in recent years: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970749&quot;&gt;an ally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s open friction with the ICC and India over security, scheduling and governance issues suddenly aligned its interests with Pakistan’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials taking place in Lahore on Feb 8, 2026. &amp;mdash; Screengrab via PCB video&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/1116263346e940a.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alignment may be situational for now, but in a cricketing ecosystem where Pakistan often finds itself isolated, even a temporary ally matters. In what seemed like an emotional and loud drama initially, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has done something that suggests calculation rather than impulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country’s stance carried weight morally as it played its strongest card not for immediate self-benefit, but in visible solidarity with another board, one with far less financial leverage and political capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode also forced a conversation about power imbalance in world cricket and structural marginalisation of smaller boards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The uncomfortable truth of the India-Pakistan clash is that it is not merely a cricket match. It is a financial event, the economic engine that quietly funds the ICC&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/11163031a88a82b.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;standing with Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan positioned itself not as a lone dissenter, but as part of a broader discomfort within the “middle tier” of cricket nations. However, the PCB has bills to pay, and such symbolic gestures, regardless of their strength, are not going to balance the books, which is why deciding to play the India game is a strategic win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking the field on Sunday, Pakistan will avoid the twin disasters a boycott would have triggered: forfeiture of crucial match points and loss of ICC revenue. The former would not have hurt Pakistan competitively as much, given their record against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 16 times the two arch-rivals have faced each other in the shortest format, Pakistan have only won three, while India dominates with 13 victories. Instead, it was the huge potential loss of money that got the governing body quiver at Pakistan’s boycott call.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s players walk back to the pavilion at the end of the Asia Cup 2025 T20 international cricket match against India at the Dubai International Stadium in Dubai, the UAE on September 14. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/1116261263d8542.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncomfortable truth of the India-Pakistan clash is that it is not merely a cricket match. It is a financial event, the economic engine that quietly funds the ICC’s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India receives 38.5 per cent of the ICC’s revenue distribution in the current cycle, which is more than what the next six boards receive combined. Pakistan’s share hovers around five to six per cent. This disparity is not an accident; it reflects market gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian broadcast market alone drives the bulk of ICC media rights, a deal worth billions over a four-year cycle, which is the major source of revenue for the governing body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan celebrates after the dismissal of Netherlands&amp;rsquo; Max O&amp;rsquo;Dowd during the 2026 ICC Men&amp;rsquo;s T20 Cricket World Cup group stage match between Pakistan and the Netherlands at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo on February 7. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/11162547c3c830c.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan celebrates after the dismissal of Netherlands’ Max O’Dowd during the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup group stage match between Pakistan and the Netherlands at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo on February 7. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite receiving the lion’s share, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)’s income doesn’t depend on the ICC, as its revenue is heavily dominated by the Indian Premier League (IPL) and bilateral series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, any financial loss to the ICC would not have impacted BCCI as strongly as it would have Pakistan and other cricket boards, whose incomes are heavily dependent on their ICC revenue share.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reason India-Pakistan contests are manufactured into every ICC tournament. They are the biggest television events in cricket, reportedly accounting for 20-30pc of a tournament’s total broadcast value in a single match. The marquee encounter does not fund India’s cricket at a large scale, but it subsidises the ecosystem in which Pakistan cricket survives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To risk that revenue for a dispute that was not even Pakistan’s own would have been strategically naive. Agreeing to play India also repairs and strengthens the PCB’s working relationship with other boards, particularly Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/in-phone-call-with-pm-sri-lanka-president-urges-pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-clash-against-india&quot;&gt;strongly requested&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to call off its boycott.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are boards that Pakistan has often relied on for neutral venues, logistical cooperation and political support within ICC committees. A unilateral boycott would have made Pakistan appear rigid, pushing it further to the margins at a time when it needs quiet diplomacy, not loud isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, even the ICC has been accommodating towards the PCB, bending significantly by agreeing to a hybrid hosting model to ensure that Pakistan does not have to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing the governing body further, especially when Pakistan lacks the financial muscle to challenge it head-on, would have been a dangerous escalation. The larger context is bleak, as the ICC is effectively run by India. This is not a conspiracy, but an economic reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s billion-plus market dictates broadcast value, sponsorship interest and administrative power. Complaining about reality without a long-term counter strategy is futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While boycotts feel defiant, the harsh reality is that they change nothing. Pakistan currently does not possess the commercial influence or on-field dominance required to force systemic change. That does not mean it should abandon principle altogether, but it must choose its battles wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By taking a firm stance and then agreeing to play, the PCB has extracted narrative value without incurring material loss. It has shown that it can push back, but also that it understands its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sport that is increasingly governed by realpolitik, that balance matters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The eight franchises have started bidding on spinners, following the conclusion of the previous round, which saw wicket-keepers being auctioned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967839&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All-rounders Hussain Talat, Asif Afridi, Danish Aziz, and Muhammad Zeeshan at the base price of Rs11m received no bids as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the ceremony, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) PSL Salman Naseer addressed the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the HBL PSL X ended, and the euphoria died down a little, and we looked ahead at the path in front of us, all commercial contracts had come to an end…monumental challenges lay ahead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PSL and PCB team have burnt out midnight oil day in and day out to get us where we are today,” Naseer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB, in a statement issued today, said that over 800 players have registered for the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the cricket board shared the base prices for players, with the top bracket set at Rs42 million (platinum), followed by Rs22m (diamond), Rs11m (gold), and Rs6m (silver and emerging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1.5m for bid amounts above Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above-mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad will have a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”, while the number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Over half of polling centres are deemed risk-prone, prompting a massive deployment of nearly 9.58 lakh security personnel. For the first time, drones and body-worn cameras will monitor the process, aiming for a peaceful transition after the Hasina era.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh election: Disinformation swarms social media</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972525/bangladesh-election-disinformation-swarms-social-media</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The General Elections are set to take place in Bangladesh tomorrow (February 12), and the social media platform Facebook has become a battleground for disinformation in the country, with fabricated quotes, doctored images and misleading photocards circulating widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False statements attributed to political leaders are seeking to provoke outrage, while unrelated images are being used to create the illusion of foreign backing or geopolitical tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, AI‑generated visuals are being deployed to frame political figures in staged scenarios, including fabricated meetings and conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts have warned that these tactics may fuel partisan hostility and shape public opinion ahead of the February election, as many voters are exposed to fake news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Din M Sumon Rahman, Head of Media Studies and Journalism at the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB), said, “The main intention behind a disinformation campaign is to manipulate voting choice. Disinformation neatly feeds the confirmation bias of a decided voter’s choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key target of disinformation are swing voters, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Voters who don’t know whom to vote for, don’t have a strong opinion, are provided with disinformation that influences them to vote for a certain political party. In this process, they use religion, violence and many other aspects for provocation,” added Sumon, also founding editor of fact-checking organisation FactWatch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one-month from mid-December 2025 to mid-January 2026, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; documented 220 cases of disinformation circulated by various party-aligned actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entities that appear to support Jamaat-i-Islami top the list, with half of the documented instances of disinformation (96) coming from them within this limited dataset. The Awami League-aligned groups follow with 78, and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-aligned actors 38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these 220 posts received over 2 million engagements (likes, comments, and shares) within the first 24 hours after they were published, showing how fast such content can reach voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-aligned entities dominate the engagement share, accounting for more than 1.8 million interactions (90.68 per cent). The AL and the BNP-aligned actors trail far behind with 5.13pc and 3.57pc of the total engagement, respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#targeting-rivals&quot; id=&quot;targeting-rivals&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Targeting rivals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data show that disinformation in the election season is not random noise but a deliberate tactic aimed at political rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings show the Jamaat‑aligned entities directed four of every five (78pc) pieces of disinformation at the BNP, once an ally but now the main political rival. These posts aggressively framed BNP and its leadership as extortionists and criminals, attempting to position Jamaat as the morally superior alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;em&gt;Uttorbongo Television&lt;/em&gt;, which released an AI video featuring a staged interview with an elephant handler who falsely claimed the BNP was the “real extortionist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP‑aligned actors countered in equal measures, targeting Jamaat with 80pc of their disinformation campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These contents frequently questioned Jamaat’s Islamic credentials and portrayed the party as a threat to the Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, pro‑Awami League entities mostly targeted the interim government and student coordinators. Examples include a widely shared claim that Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus was plotting a civil war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the political divides, defamation was the dominant weapon. Of the 220 pieces of documented disinformation, 155 were categorised as defamatory. Nearly 90pc of all defamatory content spread by Jamaat-aligned entities targeted the BNP, while almost all defamatory content from BNP-aligned actors focused on Jamaat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides accused each other of criminality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 21, 2025, a high‑engagement post falsely alleged that BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and his brother ran a multimillion‑taka scheme to smuggle Awami League leaders across the border. But there was no evidence provided against the claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat‑aligned actors also promoted conspiracy narratives, saying the BNP is willing to compromise national interests for Indian favour, including a fabricated story that Tarique Rahman had agreed not to purchase weapons without India’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP‑aligned pages attacked with their own “moral‑corruption” narratives, including a fabricated post accusing Chhatra Shibir activists of partying and drinking after inciting nationwide unrest over Osman Hadi’s killing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro‑Awami League actors, meanwhile, focused on undermining student coordinators, Jamaat, and the interim government. One post falsely claimed that student coordinators attended a DJ party after Osman Hadi’s funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#tactics-employed&quot; id=&quot;tactics-employed&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tactics employed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly 59pc of the analysed posts were manipulative content, which twisted truth into a false narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, on January 5, 2026, BNP‑aligned political analyst Maruf Mallick made one such post, distorting the findings of the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. Although the official report stated that most individuals still missing were from the BNP, Maruf reframed this to allege a “secret understanding” between the Awami League and Jamaat‑Shibir, claiming detainees linked to Jamaat had been quietly released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern was widespread. Of the 62 manipulative posts pushed by Jamaat-aligned entities, 48 targeted the BNP, while pro‑BNP actors produced 18 such posts, almost all aimed at Jamaat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond outright fabrication, political actors also distorted facts by presenting information out of context. Unlike fabrication, which relies on complete falsehoods, decontextualisation manipulates authentic information to construct a misleading narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the content analysed, 27 posts fell into this category, where real statements or events were reframed to serve partisan agendas. For example, one video post claimed to show a scene where a BNP leader harassed a freedom fighter. However, the video appears to show someone asking another person to change his seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entities that appear to support the Awami League mostly pushed narratives of minority persecution, exaggerating isolated incidents into claims of widespread violence, and invoking calls for foreign intervention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#medium-used&quot; id=&quot;medium-used&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Medium used&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While videos remain the dominant vehicle for disinformation, recent patterns show the growing popularity of photocards. Of the 220 disinformation items analysed, 104 were videos and 44 photocards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly one‑third of the disinformation posts relied on forged documents or fabricated quotes, with 75 such instances identified. These were split evenly between pro‑Jamaat and pro‑Awami League pages and users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deepfakes and other AI‑generated content formed the second most common category, totalling 58 documented cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro‑Jamaat entities produced the highest number in this category with 27 instances, followed by pro‑BNP actors with 17, and pro‑Awami League entities with 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#methodology&quot; id=&quot;methodology&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Methodology&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 220 posts analysed were collected by monitoring a watchlist of 615 Facebook pages and profiles known for spreading disinformation and hate speech. The watchlist was compiled through a rigorous, political party-blind selection process involving manual monitoring, targeted keyword searches, and cross-referencing with independent fact-checking resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political alignment was assessed by manually reviewing the most recent 30 posts of each actor before data collection began in mid-December. No official party links were examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the watchlist, 27.4pc appeared AL-aligned, 25.57pc Jamaat-aligned and 14.5 BNP-aligned. The others included National Citizen Party, meme pages, unaffiliated content creators and other foreign entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent US-Bangladesh trade deal, finalized on February 9, 2026, represents an upper hand in economic preservation, securing Dhaka’s US$8 billion export corridor to the US amid an increasingly protectionist global landscape.&amp;#160; While some analysts, including those at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) think tank, have characterized the bilateral pact as a hurried capitulation, [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bidding on batsmen comes to a close at Pakistan Super League 11 auction in Lahore</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972508/bidding-on-batsmen-comes-to-a-close-at-pakistan-super-league-11-auction-in-lahore</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first-ever player auction for the 11th edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) is currently underway in Lahore, with the eight franchises now bidding on fast bowlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967839&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the bidding for fast bowlers, Muhammad Ali was sold off to Hyderabad Houstan Kingsmen in a last-minute bid of Rs21.5m against Rawalpindi’s Rs20.5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was Chris Jordan, who went unsold after receiving zero bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#david-warner-goes-to-karachi-kings&quot; id=&quot;david-warner-goes-to-karachi-kings&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;David Warner goes to Karachi Kings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second round began with Barbadian cricketer Kyle Mayers at the base price of Rs1.1m, who went unsold after no bids were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand’s Colin Munroe went unsold as well. Karachi Kings bagged Australian batsman David Warner at Rs79m after a round of back-and-forth bidding with Peshawar Zalmi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South African batsman Rilee Rossouw was sold off to Quetta Gladiators for Rs55m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#islamabad-united-bags-all-rounder-faheem-ashraf&quot; id=&quot;islamabad-united-bags-all-rounder-faheem-ashraf&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islamabad United bags all-rounder Faheem Ashraf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction began with bidding on all-rounders, starting with Faheem Ashraf at the base price of Rs42m, with Islamabad United putting in the final bid at Rs85m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second all-rounder to be auctioned was Imaad Wasim at Rs42m, followed by Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz at the base price of Rs1.1m; however, no bids were made by any of the teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-rounders Hussain Talat, Asif Afridi, Danish Aziz, and Muhammad Zeeshan at the base price of Rs1.1m received no bids as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the ceremony, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) PSL Salman Naseer addressed the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the HBL PSL X ended, and the euphoria died down a little, and we looked ahead at the path in front of us, all commercial contracts had come to an end…monumental challenges lay ahead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PSL and PCB team have burnt out midnight oil day in and day out to get us where we are today,” Naseer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB, in a statement issued today, said that over 800 players have registered for the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the cricket board shared the base prices for players, with the top bracket set at Rs42 million (platinum), followed by Rs22m (diamond), Rs11m (gold), and Rs6m (silver and emerging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1.5m for bid amounts above Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above-mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad will have a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”, while the number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Since the European Union accounts for nearly two-thirds of Bangladesh’s garment exports and already provides unconditional duty-free access, the incentive to reorganise supply chains mainly to serve the US market remains limited.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh election offers hope to garment sector battered by tariffs and unrest</title>

      <description>Millions in Bangladesh vote for a new government. The nation&apos;s vital garment industry faces a crisis. Falling exports stem from U.S. tariffs and local instability. Factory owners seek policy changes and stable energy costs. A new U.S. trade deal offers some duty-free access. This move aims to revive an industry crucial to Bangladesh&apos;s economy.</description>

      <title>Indian cricketer Abhishek Sharma hospitalised ahead of T20 World Cup game with Namibia</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972514/indian-cricketer-abhishek-sharma-hospitalised-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-game-with-namibia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prolific Indian opener Abhishek Sharma has been hospitalised with an upset stomach ahead of the group match against Namibia at the T20 World Cup, a cricket board official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosive left-hander is key to India’s chances of defending their title at the 20-team tournament and is doubtful for the Group A fixture on Thursday in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 25-year-old was admitted to a Delhi hospital on Tuesday after he missed training with a stomach issue he carried from the opener in Mumbai, the official told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate acknowledged the concern on Tuesday, saying the batsman had “still got a few issues with his tummy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hope that he’ll be available for the game in a few days’ time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abhishek was out for a duck in India’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971699/suryakumars-unbeaten-84-rescues-india-against-usa-in-t20-world-cup&quot;&gt;win over the United States&lt;/a&gt; but has been a strong performer in the lead-up to the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; arch-rivals Pakistan in a blockbuster on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the Pakistani government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it was withdrawing its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;decision to boycott&lt;/a&gt; the match with India, which had been taken previously in the wake of Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replacement&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to tour India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision to move forward with the much-anticipated game came after protracted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;negotiations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between the ICC and the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consultations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among national leaders, and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972508/all-rounders-up-for-grabs-as-pakistan-super-league-11-auction-commences-in-lahore</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first-ever player auction for the 11th edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) has commenced with bidding underway on all-rounders at Lahore’s Expo Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967839&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction began with bidding on all-rounders, starting with Faheem Ashraf at the base price of Rs42m, with Islamabad United putting in the final bid at Rs85m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second all-rounder to be auctioned was Imaad Wasim at Rs42m, followed by Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz at the base price of Rs1.1m; however, no bids were made by any of the teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the ceremony, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) PSL Salman Naseer addressed the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the HBL PSL X ended, and the euphoria died down a little, and we looked ahead at the path in front of us, all commercial contracts had come to an end…monumental challenges lay ahead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PSL and PCB team have burnt out midnight oil day in and day out to get us where we are today,” Naseer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB, in a statement issued today, said that over 800 players have registered for the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the cricket board shared the base prices for players, with the top bracket set at Rs42 million (platinum), followed by Rs22m (diamond), Rs11m (gold), and Rs6m (silver and emerging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1.5m for bid amounts above Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above-mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad will have a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”, while the number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>US trade office removes controversial map of India from social media after Pakistan protests</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972510/us-trade-office-removes-controversial-map-of-india-from-social-media-after-pakistan-protests</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: The United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) office has removed a controversial map of India from its official X (formerly Twitter) account after Pakistan lodged a strong diplomatic protest over the depiction of internationally-recognised disputed territories as part of India, diplomatic sources told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map, which accompanied a USTR press release announcing a framework for an interim US-India trade agreement, showed the entire Jammu and Kashmir region — including Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan — within Indian boundaries. It also depicted China’s Aksai Chin region as part of India, despite the fact that the area is claimed by China and remains &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1772898&quot;&gt;disputed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was posted on the site on Friday evening, but had been removed by Monday evening, which was also the first working day after the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diplomatic sources said Pakistan conveyed its protest both to the US Embassy in Islamabad and to State Department officials in Washington, stressing that the map contradicted the long-standing and stated US position that Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory whose final status must be determined in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials familiar with the matter said the map appeared to have been taken from Google Maps, as was the case with a separate map used by the USTR in a press release on a trade deal with Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps merely showed territorial outlines and did not name any specific areas. However, Pakistani officials pointed out that even an outline map, when issued by an official US government body, carries political and diplomatic weight — particularly on an issue as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971369&quot;&gt;sensitive&lt;/a&gt; as Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern was heightened after Indian media outlets seized upon the map as evidence of an alleged shift in US policy, portraying it as an implicit endorsement of India’s claims over disputed territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials said this narrative made it imperative for Islamabad to immediately remind Washington of its traditional and consistent position on Kashmir, and to ensure that no such misinterpretation gained traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the USTR press release remains available on its website and social media platforms, the specific map of India has since been withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the map attached to the USTR’s press release on a trade arrangement with Bangladesh remains online, reinforcing the view that the India map was posted mistakenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy emerged as Washington and New Delhi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970640&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;, over the weekend, a framework for the first phase of a bilateral trade agreement aimed at boosting two-way commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a joint statement, the US will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent, having already removed an additional 25pc punitive duty. Reciprocal tariffs are also expected to be lowered to similar levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials said the protest was unavoidable, particularly in light of India’s unilateral actions of August 2019, when New Delhi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227&quot;&gt;revoked&lt;/a&gt; the special status of occupied Jammu and Kashmir — a move Pakistan rejects as illegal, unconstitutional and in violation of international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamabad maintains that any official depiction suggesting Indian sovereignty over the disputed region undermines the UN-recognised status of the territory and weakens international commitments to neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of Aksai Chin within Indian territory further compounded concerns, as it misrepresented another unresolved territorial dispute and ran counter to Washington’s stated position of not taking sides in conflicts between India and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US officials have not publicly commented on the removal of the map. Pakistani diplomats say the episode highlights the need for constant vigilance, as even seemingly technical or symbolic representations by influential international actors can have serious diplomatic consequences on an issue as sensitive and consequential as Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh&apos;s recent trade agreement with the United States appears to be a double-edged sword for its garment industry. Although it provides zero-duty access, the stipulation to use US-sourced cotton and fibers undermines their competitive edge, given their current dependence on alternative suppliers. Additionally, the obligation to import US agricultural products and energy adds financial strain.</description>

      <title>Bangladeshi woman moves Lahore High Court against ‘unjustified’ offloading by FIA</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972401/bangladeshi-woman-moves-lahore-high-court-against-unjustified-offloading-by-fia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: An elderly woman, who was allegedly born in Bangladesh and was trafficked and sold in Pakistan some 35 years ago, has approached the Lahore High Court against the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for offloading her from a Dhaka-bound flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Razia Bibi, 58, filed a petition through her counsel, Ali Changezi Sandhu, and also sought imposition of a fine on the FIA for offloading her, allegedly without any reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the petition, the counsel alleged that the petitioner was kidnapped in Bangladesh and illegally brought to Pakistan, where she was sold in Karachi some 35 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the petitioner was forced into marriage with her ‘purchaser’ in Pakistan and later shifted to Kasur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the petitioner, who is now a Pakistani citizen, recently reconnected with her Bangladeshi family through social media and her mother pleaded to meet her one last time in her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyer stated when the petitioner, on Feb 27, 2025, reached the Allama Iqbal International Airport, Lahore, to travel to Bangladesh, the FIA immigration staff offloaded her without providing any justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the petitioner filed an application with the interior ministry for action against the “unlawful” act of the FIA officials, but to no avail so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argued that on the basis of mere suspicion and assumptions regarding illegal travel and human smuggling, thousands of Pakistani youths had been falling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961655&quot;&gt;victim&lt;/a&gt; to the FIA’s “unlawful offloading”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, offloading an elderly woman without any reason clearly indicates that the FIA engages in illegal practices, the counsel alleged, and sought an order for the agency to compensate the petitioner for the amount she spent on her air ticket and visa fee.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The BCCI and BCB both erred in the Mustafizur Rahman IPL release dispute. BCB&apos;s &quot;safety concern&quot; pretext for avoiding India, fueled by social media, allowed PCB to create unnecessary drama. ICC chairman Jay Shah prioritised cricket, ensuring the tournament proceeded despite Bangladesh&apos;s absence, highlighting the distinct economic value of India-Pakistan matches.</description>

      <title>Sensible decision</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972476/sensible-decision</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;AFTER days-long negotiations, Pakistan moved for the greater good of world cricket when its government gave the national cricket team the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;go-ahead&lt;/a&gt; to play their Twenty20 World Cup match against India on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play the blockbuster fixture, which is the revenue generator for the International Cricket Council, after Scotland had been drafted in to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh at the World Cup following the latter country’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to travel to India for their matches due to security concerns. The Pakistan Cricket Board had protested the decision of the India-led ICC. While the team was allowed to travel to the tournament it was instructed to forfeit the match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its finances in danger, the ICC came to the table with its director Imran Khawaja flying to Pakistan over the weekend. Bangladesh Cricket Board chief Aminul Islam also arrived, with Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi at the centre of negotiations. Pakistan had already been requested by Sri Lanka, where the national team is playing their matches of the World Cup, and the UAE to reconsider their decision. The PCB, however, was fighting a bigger battle: to ensure equality in world cricket against the governing body that has for long acted on India’s whims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, it has succeeded. The ICC has not penalised Bangladesh, while also granting it hosting rights for a tournament in the 2028-2031 cycle to mitigate the impact from its ouster from the World Cup. It therefore made sense for Pakistan to change their stance; going ahead with the World Cup match against India means ensuring financial security for the cricket world, especially the associate members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should not be forgotten. It should also mark the start of a new era in cricket governance. The politicisation of the sport has been a menace that has hindered the growth of the game for long. Sports should not be used as a propagation of political messaging and it is high time this practice was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the arrangement between Pakistan and India, which sees both sides play their matches of an event in either country at neutral venues, ends, the ICC should look to ensuring that it normalises bilateral cricketing ties between the two arch-rivals. That would embellish the ICC’s legitimacy as a neutral body that is focused on making sure that the game stays above petty politicking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>India need not be concerned about the new trade agreement between Bangladesh and the United States.

She also notes that Bangladesh&apos;s access to US markets is tied to sourcing materials like yarn and cotton from the USA. India already supplies these competitively and quickly.</description>

      <title>Over 150,000 cops to guard ‘risky’ polling stations in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972439/over-150000-cops-to-guard-risky-polling-stations-in-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s police chief said on Tuesday that more than 150,000 officers will be deployed for this week’s elections, warning that more than half of polling stations were flagged as vulnerable to violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police records show that five people were killed and more than 600 injured in political clashes during the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972185&quot;&gt; campaign&lt;/a&gt; period from Dec 11 to Feb 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 157,000 police officers, backed by 100,000 soldiers and other security forces, will guard Thursday’s vote — the first since a mass uprising toppled the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are 1,000 per cent confident about doing our part,” Inspector General of Police Baharul Alam told reporters in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarique Rahman warns of ‘huge’ challenges ahead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country of 170 million has remained in political turmoil since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;uprising&lt;/a&gt; against Hasina, when police carried out a deadly crackdown during her failed bid to cling to power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alam said police had assessed that “more than 24,000 polling centres have been marked as either high-risk or moderately risky” for possible unrest, violence or ballot stuffing — more than half of the 42,000 centres nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The location of some centres is very remote, and there is intense competition, and hostility among candidates and their supporters,” he said, adding that 1,300 police guns looted during the 2024 unrest have still not been recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In high-risk and moderately risky centres, police will carry out patrol duty with body-worn cameras for the first time,” Alam said. He added that police were determined to ensure the polls were peaceful, but said he accepted that distrust of his force remained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is quite understandable why people do not trust the police,” he said, adding: “Over the last 15 ye­­a­rs, based on what we have delivered — in fact, for the last 150 years, our predecessors mostly beat people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bangla­de­sh’s leading prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman said on Tuesday he faces “huge” challenges if he wins elections this week, vowing to repair a country he said was looted under the previous ousted government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to ensure a normal situation in the country, so that people are safe,” Rahman told &lt;em&gt;AFP.&lt;/em&gt; But he warned the task ahead would be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Younger Bangladesh voters primed for first post-Hasina election</title>

      <description>Millions of young Bangladeshis will vote for the first time on Thursday in a landmark election to determine the country&apos;s leadership following a 2024 student-led uprising that ended former prime minister Sheikh Hasina&apos;s autocratic rule. Young people aged from 18 to 27 make up 44 percent of the country&apos;s 129 million voters, many who say they never voted during Hasina&apos;s 15-year iron-fisted tenure.</description>

      <title>EU parliament adopts twin texts hardening migration policy</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972438/eu-parliament-adopts-twin-texts-hardening-migration-policy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;STRASBOURG: The European Parliament on Tuesday definitively adopted two flagship texts tightening EU migration policy, championed by an alliance of right-wing and far-right lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is seeking to make it easier for its 27 member states to send asylum seekers to countries they did not come from but that Europe deems “safe”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has sought to test the concept with centres in Albania. The migrant centres have, however, largely stood empty since being opened in 2024 because of legal challenges, with many Italian judges viewing the scheme as unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the EU measures adopted on Tuesday is expected to facilitate this approach, to the dismay of human rights advocates and left-wing groups, who warn about the treatment asylum seekers may face in such countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green MEP Melissa Camara called it “another step in the dehumanisation of the European Union’s migration policy,” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;charging that the dignity of asylum seekers was being “trampled” on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission rejects the criticism, insisting that any country receiving migrants under the scheme must respect fundamental rights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key measure approved by parliament is the creation of a list of countries the EU considers “safe” — effectively limiting asylum prospects for their nationals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list, which includes Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco and Tunisia, is intended to speed up the processing of asylum claims and, where appropriate, accelerate returns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Citizens expect us to deliver on our promises regarding migration policy, and that is exactly what we are doing today,” conservative lawmaker Lena Dupont told the assembly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU’s political centre of gravity has shifted firmly right in recent years, and a decline in irregular entries — down around 25 per cent in 2025 compared to 2024 — has not eased the political pressure to act on the hot-button issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly one million people applied for asylum in the EU last year and about 440,000 were granted protection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘Women’s freedoms are at stake’: concern at rise of Islamist party before Bangladesh election</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jamaat e-Islami, oppressed under Sheikh Hasina’s rule, could take unprecedented share of the vote on Thursday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the clock hit midnight, the women held their flame torches aloft and marched into the Dhaka night. “The people have given their blood, now we want equality,” they shouted above the roar of the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many in Bangladesh, the past few weeks have been a cause for jubilation. The first free and fair elections in 17 years have been promised for Thursday, after the toppling of the regime of Sheikh Hasina in a bloody student-led uprising in August 2024 in which more than 1,000 people died.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/11/bangladesh-election-islamist-party-women-freedoms&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh will replace Indian cotton with U.S. cotton: Interim government</title>
      <link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bangladesh-will-replace-indian-cotton-with-us-cotton-interim-government/article70615448.ece</link>
      <description>Information adviser Shafiqul Alam says the U.S.-Bangladesh trade deal inked on Monday is a ‘game changer’ that can further open up the U.S. market for Bangladesh. In April 2025, Bangladesh restricted yarn imports from India through its land ports after bilateral ties soured. In May 2025, India imposed curbs on imports of readymade garments and other items from Bangladesh through land ports.</description>

      <title>Only purpose was to get respect for Bangladesh, says PCB chief Naqvi after talks with ICC</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972277/only-purpose-was-to-get-respect-for-bangladesh-says-pcb-chief-naqvi-after-talks-with-icc</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday said in the context of his recent engagements with Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and International Cricket Council (ICC) officials that the purpose was to “get respect for Bangladesh”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi said this while speaking to the media in Peshawar, a day after the government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it was withdrawing its decision to boycott the group-stage match against India in the T20 World Cup, scheduled for February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development followed protracted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;negotiations&lt;/a&gt; between the ICC, the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;consultations&lt;/a&gt; among national leaders and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The now-withdrawn decision to boycott the match against arch-rival India was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; by the government on February 1 after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter was raised during Naqvi’s media talk in Peshawar on Tuesday, where he was asked about several conditions that were reportedly put forward during his meeting with the ICC and BCB officials on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his response, Naqvi said: “We did not discuss anything apart from Bangladesh; our only purpose was to get Bangladesh respect, to highlight the injustice done to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And you saw that whatever demands Bangladesh made, they were accepted. That’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added, “We had no personal interest in the meeting … our task was purely related to Bangladesh. The government made the decision on that [basis]. When their demands have been accepted, and it has been acknowledged that injustice was done to them, we are playing after that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developments unfolded as the ongoing T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, began on February 7. It was, however, overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refused&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;remained firm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on not taking part in the event after the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969929/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rejected&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;request&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mulling its stance, Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave its cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expressed the hope that the PCB would consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country. Subsequently, it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week that the ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board had also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the BCB chief and ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja landed in Lahore and held a long meeting with Naqvi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day later, Sri Lankan President Dissanayake also urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;phone call&lt;/a&gt; with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Meanwhile, BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government then announced the withdrawal of its earlier decision to boycott the match against India while an ICC statement said “that no financial, sporting or administrative penalty will be imposed on Bangladesh Cricket Board”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement also said that to compensate Dhaka, it was agreed that the country would host an ICC event prior to the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2031.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday said in context of his recent engagements with Bangladesh Cricket Board and International Cricket Council officials that their purpose was to get respect for Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi said this while speaking to the media in Peshawar a day the Pakistani government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it was withdrawing its decision to boycott the group-stage match against India in T20 World Cup, scheduled for February 15.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A 62-year-old Hindu trader was brutally murdered inside his shop in Mymensingh, Bangladesh.

      <description>&lt;span&gt;Bangladesh election reveals a transformed political landscape&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Expert comment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;LToremark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2026-02-10T11:06:55+00:00&quot; title=&quot;Tuesday, 10 February, 2026&quot;&gt;10 February 2026&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s long-awaited election is being shaped by new political forces and intensified information warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class=&quot;media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;img alt=&quot;Students paint a mural in the colours of the Bangladesh national flag.&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2026-02/2026-02-10-bangladesh-election-2165625477.jpg?itok=CBc2-8eR&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Bangladesh is set to hold its long-anticipated national election on 12 February 2026. The election follows 18 months of an interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, after the government of Sheikh Hasina was ousted in 2024 by the Gen Z- led ‘Monsoon Revolution’.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This election is a potential turning point towards democratic transition. It is also consequential due to two broader dynamics at play: the emergence of new political actors and the intensification of information warfare. But with so much at stake, political violence and unrest is rife. Since the election was announced in December, at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2026/1/27/fear-and-hope-in-bangladesh-how-political-violence-is-haunting-elections&quot;&gt;16 political activists&lt;/a&gt; have been killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New political forces and a changing opposition landscape&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant developments in this election is the emergence of new political coalitions that challenge the long-standing dominance of two parties: Hasina’s Awami League party and the main opposition party, the BNP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Awami League has been banned under the Anti-Terrorism Act and will not be taking part in the election. The new chairman of the BNP, Tarique Rahman, has recently returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in exile following the death of his mother and longtime BNP leader, Khaleda Zia. Rahman is one of the frontrunners to be prime minister – if the BNP performs well in the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A notable new political coalition is the 11-party alliance led by Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and the National Citizen Party (NCP). This marks a major reconfiguration of the opposition landscape – one which aims to disrupt Bangladesh’s dynastic political system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NCP was born from the 2024 student uprising. Its unexpected electoral alliance with the more conservative Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami reflects strategic compromise rather than ideological alignment. The decision to join forces followed the murder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/19/who-was-osman-hadi-why-is-bangladesh-on-fire-over-his-death&quot;&gt;Sharif Osman Hadi&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent student leader, independent MP candidate and vocal critic of India and the Awami League. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;align-right embedded-entity embed&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi investigators have charged &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/crime-and-law/825h0mwrl7&quot;&gt;17 people&lt;/a&gt; in connection to Hadi’s murder, some of whom they say have links to the Awami League. Hadi’s supporters allege an Indian connection to the murder – an allegation New Delhi denies. NCP leaders argue the killing highlights threats from ‘hegemonic forces’, making independent political participation risky.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some NCP leaders and founding members have strongly opposed the alliance with Bangladesh Jamaat and even resigned in protest, citing Jamaat’s controversial past and stance on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/f703hmqibu&quot;&gt;women within the party&lt;/a&gt;. The majority, however, view it as a pragmatic step. NCP convener Nahid Islam &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jagonews24.com/en/politics/news/89441&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that the party has not abandoned its reform agenda, emphasizing that the NCP’s separate election manifesto underscores its commitment to democracy and equality. Moreover, although Jamaat is the only party with a strong opposition to women in political leadership roles, all the participating parties have fallen short of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/editorial/402155/there-is-no-new-bangladesh-without-women&quot;&gt;5 per cent pledge&lt;/a&gt; for women’s representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This alliance between two seemingly very different parties has also gained momentum because of their shared opposition to Indian influence. Both parties demand Hasina’s extradition from India and justice for Hadi. By contrast, senior BNP leaders have openly invited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.observerbd.com/news/524646&quot;&gt;‘disillusioned’&lt;/a&gt; Awami League members with ‘clean records’ to join the party, although individuals involved in corruption, extortion or violence will be barred. Their outreach appears to have worked. Opinion polls show nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh-election-2026/voter-interest-above-90-nearly-half-al-voters-shifting-bnp-survey-1351951&quot;&gt;48 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of Awami League voters are shifting to BNP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pre-election survey shows a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/402911/iild-survey-jamaat-led-alliance-bnp-in-close&quot;&gt;tight race&lt;/a&gt; between the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami, with limited support for others. Survey &lt;a href=&quot;https://eng.bangladeshsomoy.com/public/national/6964ec474af98&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; shows clear demographic and motivational differences: Jamaat attracts younger and more educated voters for its perceived discipline and integrity; BNP draws mainly working-age voters, farmers and labourers for its past governance record; while NCP supporters cite its role in the 2024 revolution. Young voters (18–37) make up 44 per cent of the electorate and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/news/young-voters-poised-shape-next-election-4077266&quot;&gt;may decide&lt;/a&gt; the outcome, along with undecided voters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new 11-party coalition has received mixed reactions &amp;nbsp;from citizens – and seems to illustrate of the tension between political survival and ideological principle in Bangladesh’s increasingly volatile political landscape. Although joining the coalition expands the NCP’s reach, it risks weakening its identity as a genuine political alternative if voters become unsure what the party really stands for.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BNP, meanwhile, will benefit from the absence of the Awami League, but the party must deal with internal divisions exposed by the death of Khaleda Zia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Information warfare&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The run-up to this election has been heavily shaped by an information war. As political parties and independent candidates use social media to run their campaigns and simultaneously challenge each other’s narratives, the widespread use of bot-generated comments and emojis to influence voter opinion is evident. Serious concerns have also been raised by misinformation and disinformation campaigns, as well as AI-generated deepfakes. Social media has seen a surge of short, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/out-context-videos-manipulate-religious-sentiment-ahead-polls-4096601&quot;&gt;decontextualized video clips&lt;/a&gt; of political leaders’ remarks on religion, which are being used to provoke outrage and manipulate voter sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a growing wave of disinformation from abroad. In January, Yunus reportedly &amp;nbsp;warned of a ‘flood’ of foreign disinformation in the run up to the election, during a call to the UN. Rumor Scanner Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/y8yewssuhy&quot;&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that last year 73 Indian news outlets, and the ousted Awami League, published 140 reports containing false or misleading information about Bangladesh. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/indian-media-al-spreading-disinformation-about-bangladesh-press-secretary-1350586&quot;&gt;Yunus’s press secretary&lt;/a&gt; also recently claimed that Indian media was responsible for spreading ‘alarming false narratives’ about Bangladesh. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/42037d486c06&quot;&gt;misogynistic post&lt;/a&gt; from Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman’s verified X account sparked widespread outrage and campus protests, with BNP critics saying it demeaned women’s leadership. But Jamaat claims that the accounts of its top leaders, including Rahman, were hacked using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh-election-2026/jamaat-alleges-leaders-x-accounts-hacked-using-india-origin-malware&quot;&gt;India-origin malware&lt;/a&gt; sent via emails linked to the president’s office and the Bangladesh Computer Council as part of a coordinated cyberattack aimed at undermining national sovereignty and the election process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Islamist leader rises from obscurity to challenge for Bangladesh&apos;s top job</title>

      <description>Shafiqur Rahman, Jamaat-e-Islami&apos;s chief, has emerged as a significant contender for Bangladesh&apos;s prime minister after decades on the political fringe. Capitalizing on a post-uprising vacuum, Rahman has revitalized the once-banned party, presenting it as a moral alternative guided by Islamic values, though his views on women have drawn controversy.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s Tarique Rahman: From exile to edge of power</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-from-exile-to-edge-of-power</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Less than two months after&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963315&quot;&gt; returning &lt;/a&gt;from nearly two decades of self-imposed exile in London, Tarique Rahman could win one of Bangladesh’s most pivotal elections and become prime minister, leading the country as his parents once did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If opinion polls hold, Thursday’s election would mark a remarkable reversal of fortune for the soft-spoken 60-year-old, who left the country in 2008, saying he needed medical treatment after his release from detention under a military-backed caretaker administration. He had been held after a crackdown on corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Army personnel patrol the streets ahead of the national election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 10, 2026. &amp;mdash;Reuters&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/101310582212f07.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Army personnel patrol the streets ahead of the national election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 10, 2026. —Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He returned home to a hero’s welcome last Christmas after a youth-driven uprising uprooted his Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s arch-enemy, long-time premier Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League, in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, now in&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt; exile &lt;/a&gt;in New Delhi, and Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, long dominated Bangladeshi politics, while Rahman’s father was a leading Bangladesh independence figure who ruled the country from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman has pledged to recalibrate Bangladesh’s international partnerships to attract investment without tying the country too closely to any single power, in contrast with Hasina, who was seen as aligned with New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman has also highlighted expanding financial aid for poor families, reducing reliance on garment exports by promoting industries such as toys and leather goods, and introducing a two-term, 10-year limit for prime ministers to deter autocratic tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events have unfolded so quickly since Rahman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963085&quot;&gt;landed &lt;/a&gt;in Dhaka with his cardiologist wife and barrister daughter that he said he has scarcely had time to reflect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know how we have passed every minute since we landed,” Rahman said on the sidelines of an interview with &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; in his party office, flanked by his daughter Zaima, who has been trying to drum up support for her father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bespectacled Rahman was born on November 20, 1965, in Dhaka to Khaleda and former president Ziaur Rahman, the founder of the BNP. He studied international relations at the University of Dhaka, dropped out, and later started businesses in textiles and agricultural products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since his return, Rahman has tried to project himself as a statesman ready to look beyond his family’s difficulties under Hasina. Gone is the image of a brash operator from the BNP’s 2001–2006 era, when his mother was prime minister. Although he never held a government post, Rahman was often accused of running a parallel power centre during her tenure, a charge he denies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What does revenge bring to someone? People have to flee from this country because of revenge. This does not bring anything good,” he said. “What we need at the moment in the country is peace and stability.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Hasina’s rule, Rahman became a central target of corruption cases and was convicted in absentia in several of them. In 2018, he was also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1876006&quot;&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to life over a 2004 grenade attack on a rally Hasina was addressing that killed and wounded many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has always denied the allegations, calling them politically motivated, and has since been acquitted in all cases following Hasina’s ouster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From London, he had watched his party marginalised election after election, with senior leaders jailed, workers disappearing, and offices shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since returning, Rahman has adopted a noticeably understated style, avoiding inflammatory rhetoric and calling instead for restraint and reconciliation. He has spoken of restoring people’s ownership of the state and rebuilding institutions — a message that has energised BNP supporters eager for a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further helping to soften his image, the family’s fluffy Siberian cat, Jebu, has gone viral on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She’s 7. She’s half Siberian. We adopted her,” Rahman’s daughter Zaima told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the BNP, Rahman’s grip on the party is strong. Party insiders say he is directly overseeing candidate selection, strategy and alliance talks, roles he once performed remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He may be a product of dynastic politics, but Rahman said restoring and sustaining democracy would be his biggest priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Only by practising democracy can we prosper and rebuild our country. If we practise democracy, we can establish accountability,” he said. “So we want to practise democracy, we want to rebuild our country.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PAF’s participation in Saudi defence expo reinforces Pakistan’s position as ‘emerging hub of aerospace innovation’: ISPR</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972255/pafs-participation-in-saudi-defence-expo-reinforces-pakistans-position-as-emerging-hub-of-aerospace-innovation-ispr</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Air Force’s participation in the ongoing World Defence Show 2026 (WDS-26) in Saudi Arabia highlights the country’s role as an emerging hub for aerospace innovation, operational competence, and reliable defence solutions, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[The] World Defence Show 2026 serves as a premier global platform for defence and security,” the press release said. “PAF’s participation at WDS-2026 reinforces Pakistan’s position as an emerging hub of aerospace innovation, operational competence and reliable defence solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube_short  media__item--relative&quot;&gt;    &lt;div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISPR added that the participation in the show underscored PAF’s commitment to showcasing Pakistan’s “rapidly advancing indigenous aerospace capabilities and its proven operational excellence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military’s media wing added that the force will feature its “cutting-edge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;JF-17&lt;/a&gt; Thunder Block-III multi-role fighter jet and the highly acclaimed Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The JF-17 Block-III, representing the pinnacle of Pakistan’s combat aviation technology, features state-of-the-art avionics, an advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, enhanced electronic warfare suite and beyond-visual-range combat capabilities, making it a formidable 4.5 generation fighter jet addressing the operational needs of modern air forces,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alongside it, the Super Mushshak trainer aircraft highlights Pakistan’s strength in pilot training solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Renowned for its reliability, cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance, the Super Mushshak has been successfully inducted by several friendly countries and continues to serve as a benchmark platform for basic flying training worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the ISPR statement, PAF’s presence at WDS-2026 reflects its leadership’s vision of fostering defence cooperation, promoting defence exports and strengthening strategic partnerships with friendly nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that participation provides an opportunity for international delegations, defence officials and military industry leaders to engage with PAF representatives and “explore avenues for collaboration, training and technology transfer”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in January, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967005&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that several countries were in active talks with Islamabad to procure the JF-17 fighter aircraft, which became a centre of attention following the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia have expressed interest in buying the fighter jets, while Azerbaijan inducted this aircraft into its air force in 2024. Azerbaijan had become the third country to acquire JF-17 fighters after Myanmar and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Sri Lanka played a key mediating role in clearing the deadlock over the India–Pakistan match at the T20 World Cup in Colombo, following diplomatic outreach led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The efforts, supported by Bangladesh, UAE and other nations, helped pave the way for the high-profile fixture. The ICC later confirmed the match would proceed as planned.</description>

      <title>COAS Munir lauds ‘character, courage, competence’ shown by soldiers in ongoing fight against terrorism</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972253/coas-munir-lauds-character-courage-competence-shown-by-soldiers-in-ongoing-fight-against-terrorism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir lauded the “character, courage, and competence” demonstrated by soldiers in the ongoing fight against terrorism, the Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an ISPR &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7615&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, the CDF made these remarks while addressing the closing ceremony of the 9th International Pakistan Army Team Spirit (PATS) Competition as the chief guest on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaffirming the core values of the army, the CDF “underscored the enduring soldierly attributes of ‘character, courage and competence’, which have been consistently demonstrated by Pakistani soldiers, particularly in the ongoing fight against terrorism”, the military’s media wing said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RadioPakistan/status/2021088816489259189&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field Marshal Munir also “commended all participating teams for their exceptional professionalism, physical and mental endurance, operational competence and high morale displayed during the exercise”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He emphasised the importance of such multinational engagements in enhancing collective preparedness and adapting to the evolving character of modern warfare,” the press release added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISPR described PATS Competition as a 60-hour-long patrolling exercise, designed to “enhance professional military skills through the exchange of innovative ideas, tactical experiences and best practices among participating teams”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercise, held from February 5 to 9, was carried out in the semi-mountainous terrain of Punjab, “providing a realistic and challenging operational environment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the years, PATS has evolved into a prestigious and highly competitive military exercise, recognised for promoting professional excellence and mutual learning among participating nations,” the statement noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It affirmed that the forum “continues to strengthen military-to-military cooperation and understanding, while fostering camaraderie and team spirit in a demanding operational setting”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s PATS Competition featured 19 countries — including Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Malaysia, Maldives, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Turkiye, the United States of America, and Uzbekistan — while Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand attended the exercise as observers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 16 domestic teams from the army and the navy, along with observers from the air force, also participated in the event, ISPR stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDF also presented awards to the outstanding participants of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“International observers and defence attachés from participating countries also attended the event and expressed appreciation for high standard of professionalism, organisation, and conduct demonstrated throughout the exercise,” the press release read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the CDF also witnessed miscellaneous training activities at the National Counter Terrorism Centre in Pabbi, including a visit to the newly established Tactical Simulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lauded the efforts of troops and the technical team and emphasised the importance of simulator-based training to complement traditional training methods, ISPR said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PAF’s participation in Saudi defence expo reinforces Pakistan’s position as ‘emerging hub of aerospace innovation’</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972255/pafs-participation-in-saudi-defence-expo-reinforces-pakistans-position-as-emerging-hub-of-aerospace-innovation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Air Force’s participation in the ongoing World Defence Show 2026 (WDS-26) in Saudi Arabia highlights the country’s role as an emerging hub for aerospace innovation, operational competence, and reliable defence solutions, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[The] World Defence Show 2026 serves as a premier global platform for defence and security,” the press release said. “PAF’s participation at WDS-2026 reinforces Pakistan’s position as an emerging hub of aerospace innovation, operational competence and reliable defence solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube_short  media__item--relative&quot;&gt;    &lt;div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISPR added that the participation in the show underscored PAF’s commitment to showcasing Pakistan’s “rapidly advancing indigenous aerospace capabilities and its proven operational excellence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military’s media wing added that the force will feature its “cutting-edge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;JF-17&lt;/a&gt; Thunder Block-III multi-role fighter jet and the highly acclaimed Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The JF-17 Block-III, representing the pinnacle of Pakistan’s combat aviation technology, features state-of-the-art avionics, an advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, enhanced electronic warfare suite and beyond-visual-range combat capabilities, making it a formidable 4.5 generation fighter jet addressing the operational needs of modern air forces,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alongside it, the Super Mushshak trainer aircraft highlights Pakistan’s strength in pilot training solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Renowned for its reliability, cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance, the Super Mushshak has been successfully inducted by several friendly countries and continues to serve as a benchmark platform for basic flying training worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the ISPR statement, PAF’s presence at WDS-2026 reflects its leadership’s vision of fostering defence cooperation, promoting defence exports and strengthening strategic partnerships with friendly nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that participation provides an opportunity for international delegations, defence officials and military industry leaders to engage with PAF representatives and “explore avenues for collaboration, training and technology transfer”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in January, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967005&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that several countries were in active talks with Islamabad to procure the JF-17 fighter aircraft, which became a centre of attention following the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia have expressed interest in buying the fighter jets, while Azerbaijan inducted this aircraft into its air force in 2024. Azerbaijan had become the third country to acquire JF-17 fighters after Myanmar and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Great for competition and cricket’: Reactions pour in to Pakistan’s decision to play India in the T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972249/great-for-competition-and-cricket-reactions-pour-in-to-pakistans-decision-to-play-india-in-the-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cricket commentators, journalists and political figures reacted on Tuesday to the government’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that Pakistan would play the T20 World Cup match against India, scheduled for February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had previously vowed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; the match, in support of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; after the International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected its plea to let it play its matches against India in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Pakistan’s decision to play India was made after an ICC delegation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt; in the country over the weekend and held meetings with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match. Sri Lanka had also urged Pakistan to play India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the decision, Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath thanked PM Shehbaz, as well as Pakistan’s government and Foreign Office (FO), on social media for “positively considering Sri Lanka’s request” to play its T20 clash against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I also appreciate the PCB and Pakistan’s sports authorities for their cooperation. A gesture that reflects sportsmanship, friendship, and the strength of our bilateral ties,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HMVijithaHerath/status/2021032899991175299&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called PM Shehbaz yesterday, had expressed delight at the decision and thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalist Faizan Lakhani reposted the statement, commenting, “When a head of state publicly thanks Pakistan for agreeing to play a match that doesn’t even involve his own team, it’s clear this was bigger than sport.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the statement by the Sri Lankan president highlighted Pakistan’s importance in world cricket and showed that “government-level intervention was needed to resolve a serious standoff” and keep the game on course.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, former cricketer Shahid Afridi praised the decision, saying, “The spirit of cricket has prevailed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the government of Pakistan had “protected the sanctity of the T20 World Cup and ensured the game’s global stability” with their decision to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cricket wins, which means it will continue to play its pivotal role of bridging the widest of divides.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former English cricketer Michael Vaughan termed the decision to play “great for the competition and cricket”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need them to somehow play a Test series soon as well … “[the] UK would be a great place to host a three-match series,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle suggested that the decision to play had been inevitable, saying, “Pakistan were always going to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was clear as daylight. Withdrawal was never even a possibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veteran Indian journalist Pradeep Magazine told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; “good sense has prevailed on all sides”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial considerations would have been taken into account, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“India-Pakistan is not just about cricket revenue — it also means wider commercial revenue,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone realised that losing the revenue from an India-Pakistan match would have been a loss-loss situation for all ICC member nations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also posted on social media on Tuesday morning, “India may be the economic driver behind cricket and generate revenues and huge money for the game but it needs teams to play against to do so. Sports does not exist in a vacuum.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, former India cricketer Madan Lal told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;: “Pakistan did shake up the ICC by repeatedly saying they would not play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eventually, the ICC had to send officials to Pakistan to sort out the issue” and that was ‘good for cricket’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want strong teams to play so that the charm of the World Cup is not lost,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lal also posted on X that “Bangladesh solved the problem for ICC. They told Pakistan to play the game on the 15th. What happened behind closed doors nobody knows.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh poll race heats up on final day of campaigning</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972185/bangladesh-poll-race-heats-up-on-final-day-of-campaigning</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Tens of thousands of supporters attend rival rallies across Dhaka&lt;br /&gt;• Voters will elect lawmakers to a 350-seat parliament&lt;br /&gt;• BNP, led by Khaleda Zia’s son Tarique, widely seen as a frontrunner&lt;br /&gt;• BNP’s main rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, led by Shafiqur Rahman, allied with the student-led National Citizen Party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s election &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968417&quot;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; entered its final day on Monday before this week’s vote, with rival parties invoking the 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters attended a series of rival rallies across the sprawling capital Dhaka, as parties sought to harness the legacy of the mass uprising and pitch competing visions of change for the country of 170 million in Thursday’s election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Asian nation will elect a 350-seat parliament, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — led by Tarique Rahman, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; in December after 17 years in exile — widely tipped as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s key rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party that is led by Shafiqur Rahman and has allied with the National Citizen Party (NCP) that was formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman appeared confident as he bounced on stage to address a crowd of thousands of BNP loyalists who waved flags and the party symbol, a sheaf of rice, and greeted their leader as if at a rock concert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP alone has a plan to run the country and the experience to do so,” he said, referring to his late parents, Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia, who both led the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No other parties have that.” Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP from his mother, Khaleda Zia, who died in December at the age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police ringed the stage as he spoke and watched from the tops of tower blocks surveying the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Justice’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;overthrown&lt;/a&gt; on August 5, 2024, after 15 years in power and her Awami League party was banned by the interim government from running in the elections, a move criticised by rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 78-year-old, known for her iron-fisted rule, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to death in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power and remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-i-Islami chief Shafiqur Rahman, leading a coalition of Islamist parties ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood — under the symbol of weighing scales — also headed packed rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Jamaat comes to power, extortion and violence will reduce,” said Ashikuzzaman Shaon, a 21-year-old student. “They’ll establish justice.” The Jamaat chief has accused the former ruling party of widespread repression, but also warned that new forms of abuse had quickly followed its fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A section of the oppressed turned into oppressors just a day after August 5,” he told a rally on Sunday, alleging extortion and corruption by returning political figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Common people, business owners — even beggars — are now fed up. Justice has been sent into exile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Long live the revolution’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat’s ally, NCP leader Nahid Islam, has also accused major parties of quietly sharing the “businesses of extortion and crime” for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you elect me, I will dedicate myself to the betterment of the area,” Islam said, thanking women supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we lose, August 5 will also lose.” Supporters chanted popular slogans from the uprising, including “Long live the revolution!” “Slavery or freedom?”, they chanted, replying in unison, “Freedom, freedom!” Among the crowds on Monday was Tota Mia, 58, a rickshaw puller who had attended rallies on all sides and took a pragmatic approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen everyone,” he said. “And this time I will vote for Jamaat. It doesn’t matter if I eat more or I eat less, I just want peace.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Feb 10 - China’s influence in Bangladesh, boosted by the 2024 ouster of New Delhi‑aligned leader Sheikh Hasina, is likely to deepen after this week&apos;s election, although politicians and analysts say India is too large a neighbour to be sidelined completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PSL franchise Multan Sultans sold for record Rs2.45bn; new owner says name will be changed to Rawalpindi</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972074/psl-franchise-multan-sultans-sold-for-record-rs245bn-new-owner-says-name-will-be-changed-to-rawalpindi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Super League franchise (PSL) Multan Sultans on Monday was sold to Walee Technologies for a record Rs2.45 billion ahead of the tournament’s 11th edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the auction in Lahore, show host Fakhr-i-Alam informed bidders that the winning bid would also cover the annual fee to maintain ownership of the team for the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MultanSultans/status/2020864897551106059&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the auction ceremony, the new owner of the team announced that they would be changing the name to Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you ready for a surprise? We will be going for Rawalpindi!” announced the company’s chief executive officer, Ahsan Tahir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the ceremony, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi congratulated Walee Technologies on their successful bid and expressed gratitude to former board chairman Najam Sethi for his vision for the Multan Sultans franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Multan Sultans was created by Najam Sethi &lt;em&gt;sahib&lt;/em&gt;; we are so pleased he is with us today,” Naqvi said, inviting Sethi onto the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Sethi said, “I’m obviously delighted to be here; this is the culmination of a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m obviously over the moon that it’s come through under Mohsin Naqvi, who is a dear, dear friend of mine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sethi hailed the winning bid as a “great moment for Pakistan cricket”, adding that Naqvi would give good news “beyond PSL” over the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, at a press conference with representatives from Walee Technologies, Naqvi said that the future of the Multan Sultans brand would have to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot ask the person paying Rs2.45bn to keep the name Multan Sultans,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we discussed auctioning Multan Sultans, we planned to keep it for one or two years. But there was a good environment in the market and we were already auctioning five or six teams,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCB chief noted that there were concerns, given the brand’s age and the possibility of damage to its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, Multan Sultans is very close to my heart, so we will come up with a solution,” Naqvi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about the criteria for setting the opening bid at Rs1.82bn, he replied that it was the second-highest bid for the Sialkot team, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965821&quot;&gt;sold&lt;/a&gt; for Rs1.85bn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a question about ongoing meetings with a delegation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Pakistan’s boycott of the match with India in the T20 World Cup, Naqvi replied, “The issue was Bangladesh’s. We did not want to let their point of view go; they are our brothers and you saw the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things are happening, which is why I won’t say much, but the ICC and the Bangladesh board are in that phase where if I say anything, it won’t be right. We’ll update you once we receive information,” the PCB chief said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi said that “guests need to be respected” when asked about the attitude of the visiting ICC delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walee Technologies is a global company specialising in projects in the media, finance and technology sectors, according to their &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://walee.pk/about-walee/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, which added that the company had also earlier acquired PSL livestreaming rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Multan franchise, started in 2017, competed in eight consecutive editions of the PSL, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1631329&quot;&gt;winning &lt;/a&gt;the league in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, the franchise was left &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957302&quot;&gt;ownerless &lt;/a&gt;after the PCB did not extend a renewal offer to owner Ali Khan Tareen. The PCB then announced it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963738&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;take over&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the franchise for the upcoming tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan to play T20 World Cup match against India, govt announces</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The government announced on Monday that Pakistan would play the T20 World Cup match against India, scheduled for February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to play the match comes after a delegation from the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt; in the country over the weekend and held meetings with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match against India. It also came hours after Sri Lanka urged Pakistan to play India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on X, the government said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was formally briefed by PCB Chairman Naqvi regarding the outcomes of high-level deliberations held between the PCB, representatives of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the BCB, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GovtofPakistan/status/2020922168406835257&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government further noted the statement by BCB President Aminul Islam. The profound gratitude expressed by our brotherly nation is received with great warmth. Pakistan reaffirms that it stands shoulder to shoulder with Bangladesh,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It noted that PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During their warm and friendly conversation, they recalled that Pakistan and Sri Lanka had always stood shoulder to shoulder, especially during challenging times. The Sri Lankan president requested the prime minister to accord serious consideration to amicably resolve the current impasse,” the government said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In view of the outcomes achieved in multilateral discussions, as well as the request of friendly countries, the government of Pakistan hereby directs the Pakistan national cricket team to take the field on February 15, 2026, for its scheduled fixture in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this decision has been taken with the aim of protecting the spirit of cricket, and to support the continuity of this global sport in all participating nations,” the government said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The prime minister and the people of Pakistan extend their best wishes to the Men in Green. We remain confident that our team will carry the spirit of sportsmanship and national pride onto the field as they compete for global glory,” the government said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reacting to the post, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said, “Game &lt;em&gt;on hai&lt;/em&gt; (the game is on)!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole nation stands behind the men in green. Great decision by the PM Shehbaz and great diplomacy by PCB chairman,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called PM Shehbaz earlier in the day, thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As co-host of the tournament, Sri Lanka thanks the ICC and all concerned for their efforts. Sri Lanka hasn’t forgotten the solidarity shown by both India and Pakistan during the 1996 World Cup, when they played in Colombo at a time when others refrained due to security concerns,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Sri Lankan President Dissanayake had urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India. He made the request during a phone call with PM Shehbaz, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan fully supported Sri Lankan cricket during terrorism in Sri Lanka,” he was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan gave priority to its long-standing relations with Sri Lanka above all else, and the Pakistani cricket team continued to tour the country to play cricket despite terrorism,” Dissanayake said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier welcomed the Sri Lankan president’s sentiments and noted how Colombo also stood with Islamabad during difficult times and kept cricket going in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Recently, the Sri Lankan team took an unforgettable step for the Pakistani nation and cricket fans by not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1954722&quot;&gt;cancelling the tour of Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, PM Shehbaz said he would inform the Sri Lankan president about a “final decision” regarding the Pak-India match after consultations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the match against India. In the statement shared by state-run &lt;em&gt;PTV&lt;/em&gt; on X, the BCB expressed gratitude to the PCB and ICC for their “positive roles in trying to overcome recent challenges”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He particularly thanked the PCB, its chairman and cricket fans in Pakistan for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Throughout this period, the PCB has demonstrated exemplary sportsmanship and solidarity,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting BCB President Islam, the statement read, “We are deeply moved by Pakistan’s efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,” Islam added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the ICC said that it would not impose any penalty on the BCB for opting out of the T20 World Cup and also agreed that the country would host an ICC event prior to the 2031 tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the ICC said that it had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; an “open, constructive and congenial dialogue” with PCB and BCB officials, saying that the meeting was not limited to the tournament in India, but the “broader outlook for cricket in South Asia”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While reflecting on the Bangladesh cricket team’s unfortunate absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the global governing body for cricket reaffirmed BCB’s position as a valued full member, with a proud cricketing history and a vital role in the growth of the global game,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ICC/status/2020916613462229482&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement reiterated the ICC’s continued facilitation of growth in one of cricket’s “most vibrant” markets, with more than 200 million passionate fans, to ensure that Bangladesh’s non-participation in the tournament did not have any long-term effects on cricket in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing the highlights of the dialogue with BCB and PCB officials, the statement said that it reflected “a forward-looking alignment reached in good faith” and was “intended to provide clarity on the current position of the stakeholders”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further mentioned that these outcomes did not “alter, qualify or detract from the ICC’s constitutional autonomy, governance framework or established decision-making processes”, all of which remained fully applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governing body added that it was agreed that “no financial, sporting or administrative penalty will be imposed on [the] BCB” in relation to the current matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is acknowledged that BCB retains the right to approach the dispute resolution committee should it choose to do so. This right exists under current ICC regulations and remains intact,” it stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement noted that the ICC’s approach was guided by its principles of neutrality and fairness and reflected the shared objective of facilitative support rather than punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, all the parties reached an agreement that Bangladesh would host an ICC event prior to the Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2031, “subject to the usual ICC hosting processes, timelines and operational requirements”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This reflects confidence in Bangladesh’s capability as a host and reinforces the ICC’s commitment to providing meaningful hosting opportunities across its membership to develop cricket in the country,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that the governing body, the Pakistani and Bangladeshi boards and other members remained committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity,” the statement read&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC Chief Executive Sanjog Gupta was quoted as saying, “Bangladesh’s absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is regrettable but it does not alter the ICC’s enduring commitment to Bangladesh as a core cricketing nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our focus continues to be on working closely with key stakeholders, including BCB, to ensure the sport grows sustainably in the country and that future opportunities for its players and fans are strengthened,” Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further added that Bangladesh remained a priority cricket ecosystem deserving of long-term investment in its development, competitiveness and global integration, and was not defined by short-term disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the government had given &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision had come after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be mentioned that Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan to play T20 World Cup clash against India: state- run media</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-clash-against-india-state-run-media</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has agreed to play the match against India in the T20 World Cup, state-run Pakistan TV reported on Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on the social media platform X, the broadcaster said: “Pakistan has agreed to play the T20 World Cup match against India on February 15, following requests from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, with India accepting Pakistan’s preconditions”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development came shortly after Sri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India. He made the request during a phone call with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan fully supported Sri Lankan cricket during terrorism in Sri Lanka,” he was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan gave priority to its long-standing relations with Sri Lanka above all else, and the Pakistani cricket team continued to tour the country to play cricket despite terrorism,” Dissanayake said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier welcomed the Sri Lankan president’s sentiments and noted how Colombo also stood with Islamabad during difficult times and kept cricket going in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Recently, the Sri Lankan team took an unforgettable step for the Pakistani nation and cricket fans by not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1954722&quot;&gt;cancelling the tour of Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, PM Shehbaz said he would inform the Sri Lankan president about a “final decision” regarding the Pak-India match after consultations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) thanked the PCB for its solidarity, while BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the February 15 match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB expressed gratitude to the PCB and ICC for their “positive roles in trying to overcome recent challenges”, particularly thanking the PCB, its Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and cricket fans in Pakistan for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Throughout this period, the PCB has demonstrated exemplary sportsmanship and solidarity,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting BCB President Islam, the statement read, “We are deeply moved by Pakistan’s efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,” Islam added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government had given &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision had come after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, a delegation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt; in the country and held meetings with PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be mentioned that Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh’s election campaign entered its final day on Monday before this week’s vote, with rival parties invoking the 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.
Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters attended a succession of rival rallies across the sprawling capital Dhaka, as parties sought to harness the legacy of the mass uprising and pitch competing visions of change for the country of 170 million in Thursday’s election.
The South Asian nation will elect a 350-seat...</description>

      <title>Scotland spoil Italy’s T20 World Cup debut with big win</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972064/scotland-spoil-italys-t20-world-cup-debut-with-big-win</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;T20 World Cup debutants Italy had a bruising introduction to cricket’s biggest stage as they suffered a crushing 73-run loss to Scotland on Monday in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland piled up 207-4 with opener George Munsey top-scoring with 84 and in reply, Italy were bowled out for 134 in 16.4 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off-spinner Michael Leask took 4-17 for Scotland, adding to his batting cameo of an unbeaten 22 off five balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nation better known for its football, Italy are the lowest-ranked side in the 20-team tournament and were making a slice of history here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chasing a mammoth 208 for victory, they suffered early blows before a valiant fourth-wicket partnership of 73 between Australia-born brothers Ben and Harry Manenti kept them afloat at Eden Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CricketScotland/status/2020782307871965359&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Harry departed for 37 and Ben got out after his 31-ball 52 as the Italian batting collapsed from 113-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully we’ll sit down at some stage and reflect on that little partnership that we had and it would have been nice to contribute to a win there,” said vice-captain Harry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called playing with his brother “special”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obviously growing up and playing backyard cricket with him, batting together, and as young kids then dreaming of being at a World Cup batting together and we’ve got to live that out today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa-born captain Wayne Madsen could not bat after he dislocated his shoulder while fielding and might miss the rest of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland skipper Richie Berrington said it was vital for them to bounce back after losing their opening match of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Really pleased to get our first win. In the end it was a comprehensive win, but we had to work hard for it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland originally failed to qualify for the World Cup but with only two weeks to go, they replaced Bangladesh, who were kicked out after they refused to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#madsen-heartbreak&quot; id=&quot;madsen-heartbreak&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Madsen heartbreak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy won the toss and bowled in the Group C encounter, where there were a few Italian fans decked out in the country’s blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland rode on a 126-run opening stand between Munsey and Michael Jones, who hit 37, to post the highest total in the tournament so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon McMullen with an unbeaten 18-ball 41 and Leask, who hit two fours and two sixes in the last five balls, took Scotland to their best T20 World Cup total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-handed Munsey started briskly with a flurry of fours to unsettle Italy’s attack in the first six overs of the powerplay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CricketScotland/status/2020766884057190703&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy suffered a blow when Madsen fell awkwardly while trying to stop a boundary in the fourth over and went off the field wincing in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His shoulder has been put back in place by the physio but he will undergo scans and is “doubtful” for the rest of the tournament, Italy coach John Davison said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The captain still completed an unusual World Cup double on Monday — playing in two different sports for two separate countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He played at the field hockey World Cup for his native South Africa, but holds an Italian passport now through his ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munsey, who was dropped on 40 by Anthony Mosca, reached his fifty in 30 balls with a six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munsey missed out on a hundred after he holed out to long-on off pace bowler Grant Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hit 13 fours and two sixes in his 54-ball knock to lead Scotland to their first group win, after they lost their first match to the West Indies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In his grand jury testimony, Nixon described a secret assurance given to Beijing during the war. His full statement reads: “The Russians were supporting India. … Nobody was supporting Pakistan because there was an embargo on the shipment of arms. … But we were giving moral support to them, and also we gave to the Chinese an assurance privately that if India jumped Pakistan and China decided to take on the Indians that we would support them.”</description>

      <title>Bangladesh votes in world&apos;s first Gen Z-inspired election</title>
      <link>https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/bangladesh-votes-in-worlds-first-gen-z-inspired-election</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Feb 9 - For years under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s opposition had little presence on the streets during elections, either boycotting polls or being sidelined by mass arrests of senior leaders. Now, ahead of Thursday’s vote, the roles have reversed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ICC, PCB officials meet in Lahore to discuss Pakistan’s boycotted match with India on Feb 15</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869/icc-pcb-officials-meet-in-lahore-to-discuss-pakistans-boycotted-match-with-india-on-feb-15</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Pakistan and Bangladesh cricket boards was held at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; the T20 World Cup match with India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was still in progress until late Sunday night, while the ICC, as well as the two cricket boards, decided not to speak to the media regarding the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a four-hour meeting, no joint declaration was issued. Per sources, there was a break for a late-night dinner, and a second round of talks was scheduled after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that the main concern of the PCB expressed during the meeting was related to the “politics rampant at a large-scale level across the ICC affairs and India’s excessive involvement in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) influence over the ICC decisions was not acceptable to Pakistan, according to a PCB source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that the ICC had “nothing to offer to Bangladesh as compensation but to ensure it would get a full share from the ICC earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources further said ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja advised the PCB to “move its case before the ICC arbitration committee or bring it up during the ICC board meeting, and end the boycott of the India-Pakistan match forthwith, as it was not good for cricket.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the evening, Khawaja landed in Lahore to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived to partake in some meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Naqvi welcomed Islam at Gaddafi Stadium, where the two held a meeting to discuss the “ongoing crisis”, the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB president thanked Pakistan for its “support” in the T20 World Cup matter.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mir and Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — were also present during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was welcomed earlier at the Lahore airport by Naseer and other officials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-level visits come a day after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;ICC Men’s T20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;remained firm&lt;/a&gt; on not taking part in the event after the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969929/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave its cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which should also be the responsibility of all its member,s including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;edged out the Netherlands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kamindu heroics steer Sri Lanka past Ireland in T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971881/kamindu-heroics-steer-sri-lanka-past-ireland-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s 11th-hour call to draft in Kamindu Mendis proved a masterstroke as the all-rounder produced a match-turning cameo to set up a 20-run win over Ireland in their T20 World Cup opener at Colombo’s R. Premadasa Stadium on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamindu’s blistering 44 off 19 balls with four fours and two sixes gave Sri Lanka the late thrust they badly needed to post 163.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spin trio of Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga and Dunith Wellalage then ran through the Irish middle order, sharing seven wickets to seal a comfortable victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just wanted to score a few boundaries and put a partnership with Kusal Mendis,” said Kamindu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kusal was outstanding today. He deserves a lot of credit. We wanted someone to bat through the innings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They played well during the run chase until the 15th over. We had to keep our calm and we knew they had to take risks and we bowled well towards the end.” Hasaranga claimed three wickets to take his World Cup tally to 40, second only to Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan, who has 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were anxious moments when the leg-spinner, who has a history with hamstring injuries, limped off after his second over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he returned to complete his quota, he moved gingerly, raising questions over his fitness for the rest of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s innings had been stuck in first gear until Kamindu strode in with the scoreboard reading 86 for four in the 14th over, boundaries having dried up against Ireland’s spinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-hander broke a 57-ball boundary drought with a cheeky reverse sweep and then went into overdrive, plundering 21 runs in the 17th over to wrestle back the momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Kusal Mendis playing the sheet anchor role in an unbeaten half-century, Sri Lanka found a competitive total from what had looked like a below-par platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland were marshalled by left-arm spinner George Dockrell, who returned a miserly spell of 2-17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 49-run stand between Lorcan Tucker and Harry Tector for the third wicket kept Ireland in the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a promising 105 for two, Ireland lost their way and folded for 143 in 19.5 overs with Matheesha Pathirana cleaning up with two wickets in the final over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They got 15 runs too many,” said Ireland captain Paul Sterling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bit sloppy in the field and we have plenty of work to do before the next game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were confident with plenty of wickets in hand, but Sri Lanka held their nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Spin is a challenge for us. It wasn’t coming onto the bat as much as we expected. Spin, I believe, is going to play a big role in this tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former champions Sri Lanka are co-hosting the 20-nation showpiece alongside defending champions India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh faces rise in Islamist politics after uprising, says report</title>

      <description>A new report highlights concerns over rising Islamist politics in Bangladesh after the July 2024 uprising. Researchers suggest this shift could negatively affect women and minorities. The analysis indicates a move towards right-wing ideology, with previously suppressed Islamist groups gaining prominence. This transition may introduce formal and informal Islamic governance, posing challenges for women&apos;s rights in the country.</description>

      <title>ICC deputy chair, Bangladesh Cricket Board president land in Lahore; both set to meet Naqvi</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869/icc-deputy-chair-bangladesh-cricket-board-president-land-in-lahore-both-set-to-meet-naqvi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;International Cricket Council (ICC) Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam separately landed in Lahore on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said the guest will hold a meeting with PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who also serves as the interior minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an earlier PCB press release, the BCB president will also meet with Naqvi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was welcomed at the airport by Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — and other officials.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-level visits come a day after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;ICC Men’s T20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;remained firm&lt;/a&gt; on not taking part in the event after the International Cricket Council (ICC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969929/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave its cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC in a statement said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup which should also be the responsibility of all its members including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;edged out the Netherlands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB chief’s visit comes a day after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;ICC Men’s T20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;remained firm&lt;/a&gt; on not taking part in the event after the International Cricket Council (ICC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969929/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave its cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC in a statement said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup which should also be the responsibility of all its members including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;edged out the Netherlands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

We will not give employment to any foreigner.&quot;</description>

      <title>Crunch Point For World Cricket: Power Politics And Double Standards Unfairly Rob Bangladesh Of Participation</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/crunch-point-world-cricket-power-politics-and-double-standards-unfairly-rob-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Bangladesh’s absence from the 10th edition of the T20 World Cup was the result of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/video/game-theory/2026/1/30/aje-onl-bangladesh_v6-1-300126&quot;&gt;the BCCI’s ego and the ICC’s double standards&lt;/a&gt; where power politics and selective decision-making outweighed fairness and sporting integrity. Although many view the Pakistan Cricket Board’s support for Bangladesh positively, in reality it is also a strategic move to counter India for its own strategic benefit. If the match is boycotted, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/cricket/401784/bangladesh-face-heavy-financial-fallout-after-t20&quot;&gt;Bangladesh will suffer even greater financial and administrative losses. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Controversial remarks in Bangladesh by a politician who questioned women’s ability to perform jobs because of their child-bearing role have caused an uproar ahead of the general election in a country where female workers form the spine of its mainstay garment sector.
Shafiqur Rahman, the chief of the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, also ruled out the possibility of a woman assuming the Islamist party’s top post.
In a TV interview, Rahman said women with babies should be given the option of fewer...</description>

      <description>The ICC and PCB have resumed discussions regarding Pakistan&apos;s potential boycott of their T20 World Cup match against India. The PCB invoked &apos;force majeure&apos; after the Pakistan government instructed them not to play, citing solidarity with Bangladesh.

      <title>Bangladesh keen on buying rolling stocks</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971817/bangladesh-keen-on-buying-rolling-stocks</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Bangladesh has expressed keen interest in procuring freight wagons and passenger coaches after Pakistan offered the rolling stock at prices cheaper than those in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-member delegation, headed by a senior Bangladeshi official, has also visited the Pakistan Railways (PR) carriage factory in Islamabad and the Mughalpura Workshop in Lahore to receive a briefing from the railway authorities and to witness the rolling stock manufacturing process, &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; has learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Lahore-based PR authorities, Mr Farhad Islam, Bangladesh’s Secretary for International Organisations and Consular Affairs and Designate D-8 Commissioner and Mohammad Iqbal Hussain Khan, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan, visited the Mughalpura workshop on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Nasir Khalili, Chief Mechanical Engineer (Carriage and Wagons), briefed the delegation on the overall functioning, technical capabilities, and ongoing projects of the PR’s workshops. A short documentary highlighting the workshops’ operational and working strengths was also shown to the guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Railways offers attractive prices to seal export deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Khalili stated that Pakistan and Bangladesh are brotherly countries sharing a common history, culture, and heritage, and that there exists immense potential for cooperation between the two nations, particularly in the railway sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delegation was subsequently given a detailed tour of the Mughalpura Locomotive Workshop, where they were briefed on the various stages of locomotive maintenance, rehabilitation, and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diplomats termed their visit informative, productive, and encouraging, and appreciated the technical expertise and professional competence of Pakistan Railways. “Our visit stands as a clear testament to the strengthening bonds of friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh,” said Mr Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi has expressed his resolve to advance railway-to-railway cooperation between the two countries, emphasising that such collaboration can yield substantial benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PR is currently supplying coaches and wagons to four countries with broad-gauge rail networks — Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chile and Argentina. ““It reflects that we have achieved modern, indigenous manufacturing capability for coaches and wagons,” the minister said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next phase, according to Mr Khalili, the railway experts from Bangladesh will also visit Pakistan for a detailed technical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, Pakistan Railways exported rolling stock to Bangladesh while it provided freight wagons to Sri Lanka in 1999 and 2000 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current regional context, Pakistan is emerging as a suitable and cost-effective alternative to other international suppliers for Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh was dealing with India regarding the provision of wagons and coaches. But now Dhaka has shown its interest in us for this purpose,” Mr Khalili told Dawn when contacted. He said the delegation also visited the Islamabad carriage factory a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>REGION: A RESURGENT JAMAAT IN BANGLADESH</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971510/region-a-resurgent-jamaat-in-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ramesh Chandra, 44, from Gopalganj district in Bangladesh’s southwest, 127 kilometres from the capital Dhaka, has been making sculptures for over two decades. He is a voter in the Gopalganj-3 constituency, from where former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was elected for eight consecutive terms. Chandra has long supported Hasina’s Awami League.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this time, the situation is different. Following the mass student-led uprising on August 5, 2024, Sheikh Hasina fled to India. On May 10, 2025, the interim government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, banned the political activities of the Awami League and all its affiliates, under the Anti-Terrorism Act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh, a domestic judicial body founded by Hasina in 2010, is currently prosecuting Awami League leaders for “genocide” and “crimes against humanity”, related to the 2024 movement. Ironically, the same tribunal sentenced Hasina to death for ordering a crackdown on the 2024 protesters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, the tribunal had awarded death sentences to several Jamaat-i-Islami leaders for ‘war crimes’ during the 1971 war and supporting Pakistan, resulting in the execution of Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mujahid in 2015 and Jamaat chief Motiur Rahman Nizami in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once banned and vilified in Bangladesh, the Jamaat-i-Islami is now polling neck-and-neck with the country’s mainstream opposition. As the country prepares for its first election since the 2024 uprising, voters disillusioned with corruption are turning to an unexpected alternative…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current government has stated that the Awami League will not be able to resume political activities until the trial is completed. As a result, the Awami League will not participate in the upcoming February 12 elections, the first national polls since the mass uprising. Despite being banned, the Awami League is campaigning against the polls on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked if he would be voting this time, Chandra tells Eos, “Why wouldn’t I vote? I will vote and, this time, I will vote for the Jamaat. Everyone has had a chance. This time, Jamaat should be given a chance,” he continues. “Besides, none of them [Jamaat leaders] engage in corruption and extortion,” he claims. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Chandra, many other voters are now also leaning towards the Jamaat-i-Islami, reflecting a broader electoral transformation sweeping Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A SURGING POLITICAL FORCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A December survey by the US-based International Republican Institute (IRI) showed 30 percent of voters backing the party of the late former PM Khaleda Zia, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP); 26 percent supporting the Jamaat-i-Islami; and six percent supporting the National Citizen Party (NCP), formed by student activists involved in the August 2024 popular uprising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mid-January joint poll by Projection BD, IILD, Jagoron Foundation and NarratiV indicates a tighter race, with BNP at 34.7 percent, Jamaat close behind at 33.6 percent and NCP at 7.1 percent. It’s a remarkable turnaround for both the leading parties, whose leaders had been incarcerated and executed and particularly for the Jamaat, which was banned under the Sheikh Hasina regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the Jamaat is competing closely with the BNP due to growing public dissatisfaction with corruption and extortion at the grassroots level, following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. Jamaat has sought to capitalise on this sentiment by presenting itself as a disciplined alternative. Its initiatives, including digital tools to track extortion complaints and monitor government spending, have drawn widespread attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party’s rising popularity among young voters is also evident. According to Election Commission data from November 2025, Bangladesh has around 127.7 million registered voters, including roughly 45 million aged 18 to 35. In recent student union elections at several universities, including Dhaka University, the Jamaat’s student wing, the Islami Chhatra Shibir, won decisively across contested positions, while the BNP-backed Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal failed to secure any significant posts. Many experts believe the student parliament elections could influence the next national polls, though others disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jamaat-i-Islami has formed an 11-party electoral alliance for the upcoming elections, including with the NCP, the student-led party. With the Awami League absent, the BNP and the Jamaat-led coalition are poised to be the main contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nahid Islam, convener of the NCP, tells Eos that the alliance is electoral rather than ideological. “Our political views differ from those of Jamaat-i-Islami, but we align on reform, justice and anti-corruption agendas,” he says. “That is why we formed this alliance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islam is confident that their 11-party coalition will get the votes. “If given the chance to form the government, decisions will be made on common principles and will not be dominated by any single party,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JI chief, or ameer, Dr Shafiqur Rahman tells Eos that his party is receiving “overwhelming support” from across the country, citing independent surveys by, what he termed, credible pollsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman says that, since the official campaign began on January 22, he has travelled to nearly half of Bangladesh, visiting more than two dozen districts and addressing around 100 public rallies. “At each rally, the crowds were overwhelming,” he says, claiming that large numbers of supporters had turned out in favour of Jamaat candidates. “The country has not witnessed such political euphoria in more than two and a half decades,” believes Dr Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to political analysts, the upcoming election, held after the 2024 popular uprising, could be the most important in the party’s history, with it potentially winning more seats than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, The Washington Post reported that US diplomats were seeking closer engagement with the Jamaat, expecting it to perform strongly. The publication said it has audio recordings that reveal a US diplomat describing the Jamaat as a potential “friend” and stating that it cannot impose Sharia-rule in the country due to Western economic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of a Jamaat-led government has raised concerns in India, Bangladesh’s largest neighbour and Sheikh Hasina’s longtime ally. New Delhi views the Jamaat as pro-Pakistan, citing the party’s opposition to Bangladesh’s 1971 war that led to the country’s creation and alleged historical ties to Islamabad. Indian officials worry that the Jamaat coming to power could reorient Bangladesh’s traditionally India-friendly foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE QUESTION OF CAPABILITY&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Dr Rahman is confident that his party is ready to govern. “If Allah wills it and the people give us the mandate on February 12, we are ready,” he tells Eos. “Over the past half-century, Jamaat has built a talented and honest pool of leaders, capable of managing every sector.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He recalled the 2001 BNP-Jamaat alliance government, noting that ministers such as Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mujahid efficiently managed key portfolios, introduced programmes that boosted employment, utilised taxpayers’ money for development, and rooted out corruption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now, after more than 20 years, we are even more confident our leaders will govern effectively across all ministries,” Dr Rahman adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman’s thoughts are echoed by one of his party candidates, lawyer Mohammad Shishir Monir. “I alone am capable of running 10 ministries,” he tells Eos. “We have dozens more in our party like me, who are capable of running the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Dhaka University professor and political analyst Dr Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman Khan says that, while Jamaat had some experience in the BNP government from 2001 to 2006, they lack the experience of administration and running the government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dilara Chowdhury, a former professor and political analyst at Jahangirnagar University, points out that capability and honesty matter more than experience when it comes to running the country. “Currently, Jamaat has more educated and qualified people in its ranks than other parties,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analysis of candidates’ affidavits by Bengali-language daily Prothom Alo shows that, of the 224 candidates contesting under the JI’s scales symbol, 201 are highly educated, including 10 with PhD degrees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the 287 BNP candidates contesting under the rice sheaf symbol, 229 are highly educated, including eight PhDs. The analysis indicates that the percentage of highly educated and PhD-holding candidates among Jamaat’s ranks is slightly higher than that of the BNP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-i-Islami chief Dr Rahman says the party’s goal is to establish a country based on insaaf [justice], where the majority are not ruled by a chosen few, public wealth is not plundered and no one remains above the law. “Is this not the basic tenet of a model Islamic society?,” he asks. “Is this not the demand of Gen Z, who overthrew a corrupt and fascist regime?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman emphasises that Bangladesh’s multicultural and multi-ethnic population would continue to enjoy equal rights as enshrined in the constitution. “We believe in the rule of law, transparency, accountability, democracy and shura [consultation],” he says. “These principles are already embedded in our constitution and we do not view them as contradictory to Islamic values. You may call it ‘Sharia’ or any other name.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman adds that any elements contradicting Islamic principles would be addressed through parliament, not by force. “Our opponents often use scare tactics, suggesting that ‘Sharia law’ would force women into strict dress codes or deny them education or careers,” he continues. “We have repeatedly clarified that no such measures will be enforced. Women will enjoy equity and fairness in all spheres of life,” Dr Rahman asserts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party chief also addresses concerns over a Jamaat-led government’s adherence to national laws and UN human rights standards. “As a democratic party that has participated in every election since its inception, no one can deny that Jamaat-i-Islami is committed to the people’s mandate,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman adds that the party sees democratic nations in the West and East as strategic partners and aims to build a stable, pluralistic society based on freedom of expression, rule of law, equity and justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jamaat chief also points out that, despite attempts by the previous Awami League government to portray the Jamaat as militant, “they were never able to produce a single piece of evidence of Jamaat leaders or workers being involved in terrorism.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FROM PARIAH TO CONTENDER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jamaat-i-Islami was founded in 1941 in Lahore, British India, by Islamist scholar Abul Ala Maududi. The party advocates Islam as the foundation for the state and society. During the 1971 war, JI opposed Bangladesh’s independence, and its leaders were accused of collaborating with the Pakistani army and committing war crimes. The party was banned after independence, but the ban was lifted following political changes in 1975, and it returned to politics in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jamaat won 18 seats in the 1991 elections, three in 1996, 17 in 2001, and two in 2008 — a modest to poor showing in previous elections. A high court cancelled the party’s registration in 2013, while JI also boycotted the 2014 elections. In 2018, with the party still declared illegal, some of its candidates ran under BNP tickets while others contested as independents. The party remained ineligible for the 2024 election, with the ban only overturned after Hasina’s ouster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman, its chief, attributes the party’s growing current support to greater public exposure after the student-led July 2024 revolution and wider social media visibility, following decades of what he called “unfair” media portrayal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman thinks that the party’s suffering under the previous government, including the execution of its leaders and the imprisonment of its members, has earned it public sympathy. Unlike other parties, he claims, the Jamaat has avoided revenge or corruption. Instead, he says, the Jamaat cooperated with the interim government and the judiciary following Hasina’s ouster, demonstrating moral integrity that has won the party public support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts say another key factor is public frustration with corruption and extortion involving BNP leaders and activists, while the Jamaat has relatively avoided such allegations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People are fed up with BNP leaders and activists because of extortion,” says analyst Dilara Chowdhury. She adds that corruption and extortion lie at the root of most crises in Bangladesh and effective curbs could significantly reduce the country’s problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Khan of Dhaka University says that, with the marginalisation of the Awami League, the Jamaat has emerged as an alternative for some voters. “Public sympathy for the Jamaat has increased to some extent due to repression over the past 15 years,” he tells Eos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the Jamaat, the BNP is also campaigning on an anti-corruption platform. Speaking at a rally in Chittagong on January 25, BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman said the party would crack down on corruption if elected. Analyst Dilara Chowdhury points out, however, that the public has greater trust in the Jamaat than the BNP on corruption. “During BNP’s time in power from 2001 to 2006, corruption was not reduced. That is why many people do not trust the BNP,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jamaat has also announced plans to launch a mobile app aimed at tackling extortion. At a recent election rally in Dhaka, Dr Rahman revealed that the app would allow individuals to anonymously file complaints against extortionists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, since August 5, 2024, numerous BNP leaders and activists have been implicated in cases relating to extortion and other allegations. Following media reports, the party expelled several thousand members. On September 18, 2025, BNP chairman Tarique Rahman said organisational action had been taken against more than 7,000 party members in response to various allegations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts also point to internal conflict within BNP, which they say has not been evident within Jamaat. According to an October 2025 report by Dhaka-based Human Rights Support Society (HRSS), at least 85 people were killed and 5,017 were injured in internal BNP clashes between September 2024 and September 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor behind the JI’s growing popularity is the party’s charitable activities, including welfare and social assistance programmes. Through disaster relief, financial support for low-income families, and educational and medical assistance, the party has expanded its engagement at the local level. In addition, institutions associated with the Jamaat, including banks, hospitals, coaching centres, schools and colleges, have helped create employment opportunities for party workers and supporters, while also providing education and healthcare services to the wider public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise, then, that voters such as Gopalganj’s Ramesh Chandra are planning to stamp their vote on the scales symbol in the upcoming elections. But whether the Jamaat can translate polling numbers into actual seats, navigate coalition politics and govern a diverse nation of 170 million remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is certain is that the February 12 elections will reshape Bangladesh’s political landscape in ways unimaginable just 18 months ago — when Hasina still ruled and Jamaat was still fighting for political survival. For a party that opposed the country’s founding, the possibility of now leading it represents perhaps the most dramatic political reversal in Bangladesh’s history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shepherd takes hat-trick as West Indies beat Scotland in T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971704/shepherd-takes-hat-trick-as-west-indies-beat-scotland-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pace bowler Romario Shepherd took the first hat-trick of the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup on Saturday to help the West Indies blow away Scotland’s tail and win by 35 runs in their Group C opener in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shepherd grabbed a sensational four wickets in five balls in the 17th over to put an end to Scotland’s hopes of chasing their target of 183.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimron Hetmyer’s 36-ball 64 at Eden Gardens earlier propelled the West Indies to 182-5 in their 20 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scots, who only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971513/excited-scots-out-to-prove-they-deserve-last-minute-call-up&quot;&gt;received &lt;/a&gt;a call-up two weeks ago to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replace Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, were threatening a famous victory at 114-3 at the end of the 13th over, with big-hitting captain Richie Berrington and Tom Bruce at the crease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 78-run fourth-wicket partnership between Berrington, who made 42, and Tom Bruce (35) had put them back in the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But strikes by Jason Holder and then Shepherd’s burst saw Scotland bowled out for 147.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sheppie, he is one of those guys who is willing to learn and improve,” West Indies captain Shai Hope told reporters. “He is always willing to put his hand up, whatever the team requires of him, whether with bat or ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is kind of versatile for us in the middle overs, and it’s good to see him starting the tournament with a bang, and hopefully he will continue doing the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shepherd removed Matthew Cross, for 11, Michael Leask and Oliver Davidson and celebrated wildly before ending with an impressive 5-20 from his three overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holder finished with figures of 3-30 in 3.5 overs as he wrapped up the Scotland innings in 18.5 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s obviously been great to get a feel for the conditions here,” said Berrington, whose side have a quick turnaround as they face Italy at the same ground on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So I’d say there’s definitely a lot of positives we can take from today. And we need to take that into our next game in a couple of days’ time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#six-hitting-hetmyer&quot; id=&quot;six-hitting-hetmyer&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Six-hitting Hetmyer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scots won the toss and elected to field and initially had the West Indies on the back foot with some disciplined bowling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opener Brandon King made 35 as he cut loose in the seventh over to hit pace bowler Safyaan Sharif for a six and two fours off successive balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland rotated their bowlers and Leask struck the first blow with his off-spin as he bowled Hope for 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King was out next, falling to debutant left-arm spinner Davidson, caught at backward point for his maiden T20 wicket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-handed Hetmyer took on the opposition attack, hitting six sixes in all, and put on a stand of 81 off 37 balls with Rovman Powell, who made 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetmyer, who was named player of the match, reached his fifty off 22 balls with a six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powell was dismissed, but he kept up the attack with fellow left-hander Sherfane Rutherford, who scored a 13-ball 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetmyer fell to Sharif with Brandon McMullen taking a stunning catch at long-on and Rutherford followed him on the first ball of the next over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left-arm pace bowler Brad Currie returned figures of 2-23.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PCB denies approaching ICC over Pakistan-India T20 World Cup match</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971692/pcb-denies-approaching-icc-over-pakistan-india-t20-world-cup-match</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday denied approaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) in connection with the team’s boycott of the match against India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on the social media platform X, the PCB issued a statement attributed to its spokesperson, Amir Mir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I categorically reject the claim by Indian sports journalist Vikrant Gupta that the PCB approached the ICC,” Mir was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, earlier in the day, had posted on X that the PCB had “reached out to the ICC for dialogue”. He had alleged that after the ICC wrote back to the PCB regarding the legal ramifications it could face, the board approached the cricket world body for talks to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As usual, sections of the Indian media are busy circulating fiction. A little patience and time will clearly show who actually went knocking and who didn’t,” PCB spokesperson Mir said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheRealPCB/status/2020171907228996078&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that earlier on Saturday, &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; had reported a source close to the developments as saying that the PCB had reached out to the ICC after a formal communication from the cricket world body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC was seeking a resolution through dialogue and not confrontation, the source added, according to &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968499&quot;&gt;refused &lt;/a&gt;to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replaced &lt;/a&gt;by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a protest, Pakistan refused to face co-hosts India in their Group A fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;edged out Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said this week that his team would travel to Colombo for the clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;asked &lt;/a&gt;Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ICC in talks to revive India-Pakistan T20 World Cup clash</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971692/icc-in-talks-to-revive-india-pakistan-t20-world-cup-clash</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) is in talks with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to resolve the boycott of its T20 World Cup match against India on February 15, &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; learnt on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCB reached out to the ICC after a formal communication from the cricket world body, a source close to the developments told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC was seeking a resolution through dialogue and not confrontation, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968499&quot;&gt;refused &lt;/a&gt;to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replaced &lt;/a&gt;by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a protest, Pakistan refused to face co-hosts India in their Group A fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;edged out Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
