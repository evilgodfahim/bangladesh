      <title>Bangladesh Cricket Board removes director Najmul Islam amid player boycott</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967108/bangladesh-cricket-board-removes-director-najmul-islam-amid-player-boycott</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Thursday removed director Najmul Islam following protests from players ahead of Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) matches over his comments against the country’s cricketers, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first BPL match scheduled for 1pm local time today was delayed as players from Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express did not show up at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium for the game, according to &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/sports-special/bpl-2026/news/thursdays-first-bpl-match-hit-boycott-4081616&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was handed a show-cause notice by the BCB a few hours before the match was set to begin. However, the Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) had called for a nationwide boycott on all forms of cricket unless Islam tenders his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a media release today, the BCB said the decision to remove Islam was taken by president Aminul Islam Bulbul “following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation”, and that it would come into effect immediately, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/cricket/news/bcb-removes-director-najmul-finance-role-amid-player-boycott-4081746&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The decision has been taken in accordance with the authority vested in the BCB President under Article 31 of the BCB Constitution and is aimed at ensuring the continued smooth and effective functioning of the Board’s affairs,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Board remains fully committed to upholding the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this regard, the BCB hopes that all cricketers will continue to display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication to the betterment of Bangladesh cricket, and will do their utmost to ensure continued participation in the Bangladesh Premier League,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until further notice, Bulbul will serve as the acting chairman of the finance committee that Islam was the chair of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam had said on Wednesday night that he believes national cricketers should be asked to return the “crores and crores of taka” that the BCB spends on them, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/bangladesh-cricketers-threaten-boycott-unless-bcb-director-nazmul-islam-resigns-1519512&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESPN Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB officially distanced itself from Islam’s comments and expressed its “sincere regret for remarks that may be deemed inappropriate, offensive, or hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bangladesh Cricket Board also makes it clear that it will take appropriate disciplinary action against any individual whose conduct or comments show disrespect towards cricketers or cause harm to the reputation and integrity of Bangladesh cricket,” the board said in a statement, per &lt;em&gt;Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boycott was proposed by Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB), hours after Islam’s press conference at the BCB’s headquarters in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The remark made by the BCB director [Najmul Islam] has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly, and it’s not acceptable,” Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We demand his resignation. If he doesn’t resign before tomorrow’s match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow (Thursday).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;, Najmul said the board owes no compensation to players if Bangladesh miss the upcoming world cup, arguing that the BCB has never sought refunds from cricketers after poor performances at global events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question [of compensation] does not even arise. We have invested so much [in] them, they haven’t been able to achieve anything, anywhere,” &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; quoted Islam as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have we won a single global trophy till now? Then we could’ve said every time, you have failed to perform, whatever we have spent on you, now we will take it back. Return it to us,” Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam’s comments came amid Bangladesh’s standoff with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966750&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to travel to India for next month’s T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka, which is co-hosting the tournament beginning February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, led by Litton Das, are &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/team-rankings/mens/t20i&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;placed ninth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the ICC T20 rankings. They have played all nine editions of the tournament, but have never qualified for the semi-finals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh cricket took a hit as players boycotted the first Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) match on Thursday and demanded the resignation of Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Director Najmul Islam after he was handed a show-cause notice following controversial comments against the country’s cricketers on Wednesday, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; reported.*&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>US announces suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan, 74 other countries from Jan 21</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966944/us-announces-suspension-of-immigrant-visa-processing-for-pakistan-74-other-countries-from-jan-21</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: The US has announced a suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan and 74 other countries, effective January 21, citing concerns that immigrants from these nations often rely on public welfare programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department said the freeze will remain in place until authorities can ensure that new immigrants will not draw on American taxpayer resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StateDept/status/2011478657680757214?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials described the measure as part of the administration’s “America First” approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused,” an official said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Department spokesperson Tommy Piggott said in a statement that his department “will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Immigration from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassesses immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the countries affected by the freeze are Somalia, Haiti, Iran, Eritrea, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, covering regions in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. All categories of US immigrant visas — including family, employment, and diversity visas — are impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#impact-on-pakistanis&quot; id=&quot;impact-on-pakistanis&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Impact on Pakistanis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suspension could delay travel, study, and work plans for thousands of Pakistanis who annually seek US visas. Pakistani consulates in the US are expected to provide guidance to affected applicants in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#public-charge-rule&quot; id=&quot;public-charge-rule&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Public-charge rule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visa freeze is linked to the US public-charge rule, which evaluates whether immigrants are likely to rely on government assistance. While suspensions of visa services have occurred in the past, officials said the scope of this action is unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No timeline has been given for resuming visa services, but the State Department assured that countries would be notified once the review is complete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ikkis: An Ode To A Valiant Indian Soldier</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/medley/ikkis-ode-valiant-indian-soldier</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story of Arun’s role in the Battle of Basantar did not end on that day, or even after the cease fire of this two weeks war, resulting in the demise of East Pakistan and the announcement of the newly liberated Bangladesh. Major Khwaja  Mohammad Nasir, then a Squadron Commander of 13th Lancers, the regiment pitched against Poona Horse, who came bandaged the next day to collect the dead bodies of his fallen comrades, wanted to know more about “ the officer, who stood like an insurmountable rock” and whose troop of three British World War II vintage Centurion tanks  was responsible for decimation of his entire squadron of  fourteen American Patton tanks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-cutline&quot;&gt;The sign outside the US State Department building in Washington, DC, as seen on 11 July 2025 (Annabelle Gordon/Reuters)&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-wide-photo-video&quot;&gt;Off&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration on Wednesday announced that it will suspend the issuance of immigrant visas to the nationals of 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, Russia, and Somalia, starting on 21 January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates,&quot; the agency said in a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement said that the affected countries, &quot;including Somalia, Haiti, Iran, and&amp;nbsp;Eritrea&quot;, make for immigrants who &quot;often become public charges on the United States upon arrival&quot;, meaning they apply for and use government benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused,&quot; the State Department said. &quot;The Trump Administration will always put America First.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has long been routine for asylum-seekers and refugees to the US, in particular, to access social welfare benefits via systems in each state designed to get them on their feet and ease them into the community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with immigration to the US now at a nearly 50-year low because of the Trump administration&apos;s aggressive crackdown, it&apos;s likely those services will be significantly scaled back.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the full list of impacted countries was not announced by the government, a Fox News report citing an internal memo from the State Department named the following:&amp;nbsp;Afghanistan; Albania; Algeria; Antigua and Barbuda; Armenia; Azerbaijan; Bahamas; Bangladesh; Barbados; Belarus; Belize; Bhutan; Bosnia; Brazil; Burma; Cambodia; Cameroon; Cape Verde; Colombia; Cote d’Ivoire; Cuba; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Dominica; Egypt; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Fiji; Gambia; Georgia; Ghana; Grenada; Guatemala; Guinea; Haiti; Iran; Iraq; Jamaica; Jordan; Kazakhstan; Kosovo; Kuwait; Kyrgyzstan; Laos; Lebanon; Liberia; Libya; Macedonia; Moldova; Mongolia; Montenegro; Morocco; Nepal; Nicaragua; Nigeria; Pakistan; Republic of the Congo; Russia; Rwanda; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Senegal; Sierra Leone; Somalia; South Sudan; Sudan; Syria; Tanzania; Thailand; Togo; Tunisia; Uganda; Uruguay; Uzbekistan; and Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-immigrant visas, business visas, and tourist visas will not be impacted, the AP reported, but everyone coming to the US will face a heightened screening process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is now five months away from hosting the Fifa 2026 World Cup along with Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Administration officials have previously said they expect some five million people or more to come to the US for the event, but independent analysts have put that number at below one million, given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/world-cup-2026-us-gives-no-assurances-immigration-officers-wont-raid-stadiums&quot;&gt;more aggressive vetting&lt;/a&gt; procedures that could include searches of phones and social media accounts, as well as the risk of lengthy detentions without due process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;At least 100,000 visas revoked&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has posited itself as the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all-55-million-us-visa-holders-open-revocations-and-deportations-trump-administration-says&quot;&gt;anti-immigrant&lt;/a&gt; government yet, having so far &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/trump-has-revoked-100000-visas-foreign-nationals-since-trump-took-office&quot;&gt;revoked at least 100,000 visas&lt;/a&gt;, deported some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/27/dhs-removes-more-half-million-illegal-aliens-us&quot;&gt;half a million&lt;/a&gt; immigrants, and put some 70,000 others in immigration detention centres that have been criticised for overcrowding, lack of hygiene, and poisoned food.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US asylum programme has effectively been terminated, and temporary protected status (TPS) for those unable to return to unsafe countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/trump-administration-end-legal-protections-some-somalis-mid-march&quot;&gt;has been cancelled&lt;/a&gt; for Afghans, Syrians, Somalis, and Venezuelans, among others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security has been on a massive recruitment drive for agents who can act as bounty hunters and meet daily quotas for arresting suspected undocumented immigrants and even legal immigrants whose records contain encounters with law enforcement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos have gone viral of masked and heavily armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents violently dragging people out of their cars and away from their children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of those arrested have not been seen since, prompting widespread fear among immigrant communities as well as naturalised US citizens, especially those who are visibly non-white or are overheard speaking languages other than English.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has said he is considering revoking citizenship, and he has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on banning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-supreme-court-limits-judges-block-trump-order-birthright-citizenship&quot;&gt;birthright citizenship&lt;/a&gt; for non-American parents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>US to suspend immigrant visa processing from 75 countries over public assistance concerns</title>

                                        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department said Wednesday it will suspend the processing of immigrant visas for citizens of 75 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Russia and Somalia, whose nationals the Trump administration has deemed likely to require public assistance while living in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department, led by &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-cabinet-marco-rubio-secretary-of-state-nominee-39c378e19d0327a7f091f302daf8ca3e&quot;&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, said it had instructed consular officers to halt immigrant visa applications from the countries affected in accordance with &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/immigration-public-charge-trump-benefits-visas-0929b2c8f635479173929300cb683a27&quot;&gt;a broader order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; issued in November that tightened rules around potential immigrants who might become “public charges” in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspension, which will begin Jan. 21, will not apply to applicants seeking non-immigrant visas, or temporary tourist or business visas, who make up the vast majority of visa seekers. Demand for non-immigrant visas is expected to rise dramatically in the coming months and years due to the upcoming 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics both of which the U.S. will host or co-host.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt; “The Trump administration is bringing an end to the abuse of America’s immigration system by those who would extract wealth from the American people,” the department said in a statement. “Immigrant visa processing from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;


    
        




    


&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump’s administration has already severely restricted immigrant and non-immigrant visa processing for citizens of dozens of countries, many of them in Africa, Asia and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
        
            
                
    
    &lt;a id=&quot;html-embed-module-e30000&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


    
    &lt;p&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;

            
        
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The November guidance on which Wednesday’s decision is based directed U.S. embassy and consulate officials to comprehensively and thoroughly vet visa applicants to demonstrate that they will not need to rely on public benefits from the government any time after their admission in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;While federal law already required those seeking permanent residency or legal status to prove they wouldn’t be a public charge, Trump in his first term widened the range of benefit programs that could disqualify applicants, and the guidelines in the cable appear to go further in scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigrants seeking entry into the U.S. already undergo a medical exam by a physician who’s been approved by a U.S. Embassy. They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions or violence. They’re also required to have a number of vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new directive expanded those with more specific requirements. It said consular officials must consider a range of specific details about people seeking visas, including their age, health, family status, finances, education, skills and any past use of public assistance regardless of the country. It also said they should assess applicants’ English proficiency and can do so by conducting interviews in English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said at the time it could further limit who gets to enter the country at a time when the Republican administration is already &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/refugees-admissions-cap-immigration-trump-administration-197a8ef1c9c219ce6167da4aba3f5a6e&quot;&gt;tightening those rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;The countries affected by the suspension announced on Wednesday are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bosnia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Congo, Cuba, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Republic of the Congo, Russia, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan and Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Several countries ‘actively’ engaged in talks with Pakistan for its fighter jets, confirms PM Shehbaz</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966927/several-countries-actively-engaged-in-talks-with-pakistan-for-its-fighter-jets-confirms-pm-shehbaz</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif confirmed on Wednesday that several countries were “actively” engaged in talks with Pakistan for its fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, reports had surfaced of Pakistan being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966192/iraqi-air-chief-praises-pafs-professionalism-expresses-keen-interest-in-jf-17-thunder-jets&quot;&gt;in talks&lt;/a&gt; with several friendly countries for a deal on the JF-17, a light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing a federal cabinet meeting, PM Shehbaz recalled Pakistan’s victory in a war last year — ostensibly a reference to the four-day military conflict with India in May 2025 — and said the demand for Pakistan’s fighter jets had increased since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are several countries that are actively engaged in talks with Pakistan on this, and this will boost our defence production and benefit our economy,” the premier added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Defence Production Minister Raza Hayat Harraj also told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt; that Pakistan is engaged in discussions with “multiple” countries for the sale of &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pac.org.pk/jf-17&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JF-17 Thunder&lt;/a&gt; fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These negotiations are taking place and they take some time. Many countries have shown interest in these aircraft,” the minister was quoted as saying in an interview with &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/urdu/articles/cq6v9q1lmeqo&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot take the name of any country. Neither can I tell on what level our negotiations are with any country,” he told the British broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When these jets are exported, then the world will know which countries have bought them,” the report quoted him as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stressed that such matters were a country’s “jealously guarded secrets”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harraj further said, “Firstly, we must ensure that we only sell [JF-17s] to those who are our friendly countries. So they are not used against us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that China is on board whenever Pakistan signs such a deal with any country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defence production minister highlighted that the jets were battle-tested during the four-day conflict with India last year: “The entire world’s air forces saw these jets’ performance during that time and praised it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minister termed the price of the jet “an important” aspect, detailing that while the average value of such planes around the world was $250-350 million, the JF-17 Thunder was cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the exact value, he told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;, “Its value is around $40-50m; this depends on the jet’s features, and the price can also be higher than this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When enquired about whether China also received a share from the sale, Harraj was quoted as saying, “A lot of matters are discussed on the table. China is definitely included in them; it should be and it is their right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#production-capacity-a-secret&quot; id=&quot;production-capacity-a-secret&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Production capacity a secret’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a question about Pakistan’s production capacity, especially considering the interest of several countries, the minister told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;, “This is a question related to our national defence. These are our secrets, let them remain secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stressed that producing such “state-of-the-art” jets was a time-consuming task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the minister, “some portion of the jet is readied in Pakistan, and some portion is readied in China”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at China’s Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt; that “technology” involved in the jet was likely controlled by China. Therefore, any sale pact would be a joint agreement, with Beijing being a “senior partner”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“China might even increase Pakistan’s defence production, but all this will be in Beijing’s control,” the expert was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the air chiefs of Pakistan and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452/procurement-of-jf-17-aircraft-comes-under-discussion-during-meeting-between-air-chief-bangladeshi-counterpart&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; held detailed discussions on the “potential procurement” of JF-17s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966192/iraqi-air-chief-praises-pafs-professionalism-expresses-keen-interest-in-jf-17-thunder-jets&quot;&gt;visited Iraq&lt;/a&gt; this week, where he met with the air chief, who expressed a “keen interest” in the fighter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, citing two Pakistani sources, reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965650&quot;&gt;Islamabad and Riyadh&lt;/a&gt; were in talks to convert about $2 billion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959240&quot;&gt;Saudi loans&lt;/a&gt; into a JF-17 deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin also visited Pakistan last week, holding meetings with the army chief and ACM Sindhu. The military’s media wing said that the minister expressed Jakarta’s desire to further expand defence ties with Islamabad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#defence-cooperation-with-ksa-turkiye&quot; id=&quot;defence-cooperation-with-ksa-turkiye&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Defence cooperation with KSA, Turkiye&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;, Harraj refrained from disclosing details about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942611&quot;&gt;Pak-Saudi defence pact&lt;/a&gt; signed in September 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a defence agreement between the field marshal, the prime minister and the Saudi government. I cannot tell any more than this,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966014&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Turkiye was seeking to join the pact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From a strategic point of view, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan are close friendly countries of Pakistan, and there is a close relationship with them in terms of strategic policy.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan in talks with ‘multiple’ countries for sale of JF-17 jets, confirms defence production minister</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966927/pakistan-in-talks-with-multiple-countries-for-sale-of-jf-17-jets-confirms-defence-production-minister</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Defence Production Minister Raza Hayat Harraj has confirmed that Pakistan is engaged in discussions with “multiple” countries for the sale of &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pac.org.pk/jf-17&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JF-17 Thunder&lt;/a&gt; fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, Pakistan has reportedly been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966192/iraqi-air-chief-praises-pafs-professionalism-expresses-keen-interest-in-jf-17-thunder-jets&quot;&gt;in talks&lt;/a&gt; with several friendly countries for a deal on the JF-17, a light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These negotiations are taking place and they take some time. Many countries have shown interest in these aircraft,” the minister was quoted as saying in an interview with &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/urdu/articles/cq6v9q1lmeqo&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot take the name of any country. Neither can I tell on what level our negotiations are with any country,” he told the British broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When these jets are exported, then the world will know which countries have bought them,” the report quoted him as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stressed that such matters were a country’s “jealously guarded secrets”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harraj further said, “Firstly, we must ensure that we only sell [JF-17s] to those who are our friendly countries. So they are not used against us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that China is on board whenever Pakistan signs such a deal with any country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defence production minister highlighted that the jets were battle-tested during the four-day conflict with India last year: “The entire world’s air forces saw these jets’ performance during that time and praised it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minister termed the price of the jet “an important” aspect, detailing that while the average value of such planes around the world was $250-350 million, the JF-17 Thunder was cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the exact value, he told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;, “Its value is around $40-50m; this depends on the jet’s features, and the price can also be higher than this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When enquired about whether China also received a share from the sale, Harraj was quoted as saying, “A lot of matters are discussed on the table. China is definitely included in them; it should be and it is their right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#production-capacity-a-secret&quot; id=&quot;production-capacity-a-secret&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Production capacity a secret’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a question about Pakistan’s production capacity, especially considering the interest of several countries, the minister told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;, “This is a question related to our national defence. These are our secrets, let them remain secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stressed that producing such “state-of-the-art” jets was a time-consuming task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the minister, “some portion of the jet is readied in Pakistan, and some portion is readied in China”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at China’s Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt; that “technology” involved in the jet was likely controlled by China. Therefore, any sale pact would be a joint agreement, with Beijing being a “senior partner”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“China might even increase Pakistan’s defence production, but all this will be in Beijing’s control,” the expert was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the air chiefs of Pakistan and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452/procurement-of-jf-17-aircraft-comes-under-discussion-during-meeting-between-air-chief-bangladeshi-counterpart&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; held detailed discussions on the “potential procurement” of JF-17s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966192/iraqi-air-chief-praises-pafs-professionalism-expresses-keen-interest-in-jf-17-thunder-jets&quot;&gt;visited Iraq&lt;/a&gt; this week, where he met with the air chief, who expressed a “keen interest” in the fighter aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, citing two Pakistani sources, reported that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965650&quot;&gt;Islamabad and Riyadh&lt;/a&gt; were in talks to convert about $2 billion of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959240&quot;&gt;Saudi loans&lt;/a&gt; into a JF-17 deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin also visited Pakistan last week, holding meetings with the army chief and ACM Sindhu. The military’s media wing said that the minister expressed Jakarta’s desire to further expand defence ties with Islamabad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#defence-cooperation-with-ksa-turkiye&quot; id=&quot;defence-cooperation-with-ksa-turkiye&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Defence cooperation with KSA, Turkiye&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;, Harraj refrained from disclosing details about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942611&quot;&gt;Pak-Saudi defence pact&lt;/a&gt; signed in September 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a defence agreement between the field marshal, the prime minister and the Saudi government. I cannot tell any more than this,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966014&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Turkiye was seeking to join the pact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From a strategic point of view, Turkiye, China, Saudi Arabia and Azerbaijan are close friendly countries of Pakistan, and there is a close relationship with them in terms of strategic policy.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh summons Myanmar envoy after border clashes</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966858/bangladesh-summons-myanmar-envoy-after-border-clashes</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh on Tuesday summoned the ambassador of Myanmar after civil war gun battles in the neighbouring country spilled over the border, wounding a Bangladeshi girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy fighting in Myanmar’s Rakhine state this month has involved junta soldiers, Arakan Army fighters and Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) militia guerrillas. Authorities said around a dozen villages in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar district have been affected by the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve-year-old Huzaifa Afnan was struck by a bullet, while a Bangladeshi fisherman had his leg ripped off after stepping on a landmine near the frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh reminded that the unprovoked firing towards Bangladesh is a blatant violation of international law and a hindrance to good neighbourly relations,” a foreign ministry press statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myanmar’s ambassador to Bangladesh, U Kyaw Soe Moe, was summoned to the foreign ministry on Tuesday, where he expressed sincere sympathy to the injured victims and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My daughter was supposed to go to school, but she is on a ventilator,” Afnan’s father Jasim Uddin said. “My heart is bleeding for my baby girl.” More than a million Rohingya have fled their homes in Myanmar, many after a 2017 military crackdown, and now eke out a living in sprawling refugee camps just across the border in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARSA, a Rohingya armed group formed to defend the persecuted Muslim minority, has been fighting the Myanmar military, as well as rival Arakan Army guerrillas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Bangladeshi border forces detained 53 ARSA fighters who had crossed the frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladesh is experiencing a surge in political violence and killings as its 13th parliamentary election approaches. Rights groups report a significant increase in deaths linked to political rivalry and dominance struggles.

      <title>In meeting with ICC, Bangladesh reiterates its refusal to travel to India for T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966750/in-meeting-with-icc-bangladesh-reiterates-its-refusal-to-travel-to-india-for-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s cricket board said on Tuesday it had repeated its refusal to travel to India for next month’s T20 World Cup during talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Cup begins on February 7, with Bangladesh scheduled to play their four group matches in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, during a video conference with the ICC, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said it had “reiterated its request for the ICC to consider relocating Bangladesh’s matches outside India”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BCB reaffirmed its position regarding the decision not to travel to India, citing security concerns,” the board said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the ICC highlighted that the tournament itinerary has already been announced and requested the BCB to reconsider its stance, the Board’s position remains unchanged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC has not commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB said discussions with the ICC continue to “explore possible solutions”, it added, but that it “remains committed to safeguarding the well-being of its players, officials and staff”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, led by Litton Das, are &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/team-rankings/mens/t20i&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;placed ninth&lt;/a&gt; in the ICC T20 rankings. They have played all nine editions of the tournament, but have never qualified for the semi-finals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political ties between India and Bangladesh soured after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1847298&quot;&gt;mass uprising&lt;/a&gt; in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh&apos;s sports advisor claimed the nation would boycott the 2026 T20 World Cup in India, citing security concerns and an alleged ICC assessment. However, the ICC has firmly refuted these claims, stating their independent risk assessments found no specific threats and did not recommend squad changes or election postponements. Bangladesh&apos;s matches remain scheduled in India.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh standoff exposes ICC’s governance crisis ahead of T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966651/bangladesh-standoff-exposes-iccs-governance-crisis-ahead-of-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WITH less than three weeks to go before the T20 World Cup starts, the cricketing world looks on as the sport’s global governing body deals with yet another crisis. The latest, too, involves India — the country from where the International Cricket Council’s chairman and the CEO come from — naturally as the co-hosts of the 20-team showpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh don’t want to play their matches in India and want them to be shifted to co-hosts Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things have come to this point after worsening political relations between the two countries over the last 12 months saw Bangladesh’s star pacer Mustafizur Rahman being withdrawn from Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders’ squad on the directives of the country’s cricket board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia cited “recent developments” as the reason for Mustafizur’s ouster. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) responded strongly, deciding not to play in India with security having become a major concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the BCB said on Wednesday that the “ICC has conveyed its willingness to work closely” with the board to resolve the issue, the latter itself has chosen to not comment on the issue with reports emerging on Monday that Chennai and Thirivananthapuram have been put forward as venue to host Bangladesh’s matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also remains a possibility of Bangladesh not participating in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC, while trying to negotiate with the BCB, has not been able to show any kind of muscle as a governing body, especially against the host nation’s board for letting cricket be affected by politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises question marks over the ICC’s standing as a governing body in the face of India’s dominance via producing the major chunk of revenue that runs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body is led by Bharatiya Janata Party leader and India’s Home Minister Amit Shah’s son Jay, while ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta is also Indian. As former ICC president and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ehsan Mani views it, “the BCCI follows the political agenda of the BJP”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC should have a clear policy of not allowing member countries’ politics to interfere with the game,” he told Dawn last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying the involvement of politics in the making of the decisions that run the sport as the most important concern, Mani claimed other strong cricket boards were not serious about taking it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, ECB [England and Wales Cricket Board] and CA [Cricket Australia] together with BCCI are not prepared to address this and other serious governance issues and together they have prevented ICC from carrying out a governance review which I was pushing for as chairman of PCB,” he said. “The ICC board is terribly conflicted, with each director looking after his country’s interest before considering what is good for the game as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mani said he expected the Bangladesh situation to be resolved through “a fudged solution, which will be engineered without addressing the governance failings of the ICC”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) chairman Dave Cameron, who served in the ICC’s Finance and Com­mercial Affairs committee between 2013-19, echoed Mani’s views, saying that the ICC needed to switch from being “a group of members” to becoming a proper governing body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Part of the challenge is that the ICC is not a governing council but is rather made up of countries that sit together as a members’ group, and this is unfortunate,” Cameron told Dawn. “As a governing council, there are some requirements, it’s not being used in that way, which is the detriment at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAKISTAN’S OPPORTUNITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not the first time that security concerns triggered by political tensions between India and another country have come to put a tournament at risk. When India hosted the 50-over Cricket World Cup in 2023, the PCB was convinced days before the event to send the national team across the border. A stronger deadlock emerged ahead of last year’s Champions Trophy — of which the official hosts were Pakis­tan — with India refusing to return their neighbours’ 2023 gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC had to come up with a “hybrid model” to resolve the Champions Trophy matter and decided that Pakistan and India will play at neutral venues if the global tournament is being hosted by either of the two nations. That decision was hailed as Pakistan’s psychological win in the backdrop of the Indian financial and administrative muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the recent political shift in Bangladesh triggered by Sheikh Hasina’s ouster as the country’s prime minister and a consequential change of regime in the BCB, the PCB, led by Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, has got closer to the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi — also the Asian Cricket Council chief currently — and BCB president Aminul Islam were also reportedly at the forefront in making the 2025 Asia Cup happen amid calls for a boycott coming from India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former PCB chairman Najam Sethi, who himself has been in the midst of the Pakistan-India cricket issues during his previous tenure, the ongoing tensions are an opportunity for the PCB to form a pressure bloc within the ICC along with the BCB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Earlier, on any issue, Pakistan could not count on support from any ICC member if its stance differed from India’s, now it will have Bangladesh on its side,” Sethi told Dawn. “Their joint clout will be greater than the sum of their parts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan cricket leadership seemed to have sensed the opportunity after Mustafizur was snubbed by the BCCI as it the PCB announced zealously days after the fast bowler’s registration for the Pakistan Super League’s players’ draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media feeds on Sunday, meanwhile, carried unconfirmed reports of the PCB offering to host Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup matches in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PCB and BCB should scratch each other’s shoulders in their respective leagues to cobble a common front against the rest of the Boards,” Sethi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Monday evening, BCCI secretary Saikia, as per reports, confirmed no communication was made by the ICC over a potential change of venues for the Bangladesh matches. Henceforth, as the clock ticked and the T20 World Cup neared, uncertainty prevailed and so did the ICC’s deafening silence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>With the sleeves rolled up</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966713/with-the-sleeves-rolled-up</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE world is in ferment as the US lurches dangerously to the extreme right. Europe too has discarded a long cultivated democratic pretence and is eyeing its chance in the melee. Hungary, Poland, Austria and Italy have been singled out by Donald Trump’s strategists, according to their leaked documents, to subvert democracy for a right-wing takeover in Trump’s footsteps. British, French and German establishments are nudging their countries also towards militarism. EU is targeting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961041&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, Palestine and Iran even as Nato looks poised to implode in the chaos of Trump’s claims over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966583/greenland-rejects-us-takeover-under-any-circumstance&quot;&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;. The EU seeks to humour Trump over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964877&quot;&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; while retaining a different yardstick to judge Vladimir Putin’s advances in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966294/unsc-calls-emergency-session-on-ukraine-tomorrow&quot;&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the masses are retaliating. Venezuela and Mexico are staging massive rallies with sleeves rolled up to combat Trump’s threat to them. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, sensing enough was enough of his neighbour, is mending his country’s ties with China. He could be visiting Beijing shortly to counter the ultimatums to Canada’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, this is the time for the left to be initiating and, where possible, spearheading mass movements against the rightward slide. Jeremy Corbyn recently unfurled the flag with a separate party to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1926419&quot;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; the British establishment, which includes his former Labour Party colleagues who he watched with dismay removing the last stitch of morality by abetting Benjamin Netanyahu’s genocide in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon is leading a mass upsurge against Emmanuel Macron and the EU, accusing European leaders of “prostrate servility” to Trump. Mélenchon homed in on President Emmanuel Macron’s ideas on sending troops and long-range weapons to Ukraine. He demanded referendums in Donbass, Crimea and all contested regions because “it’s the people who decide” rather than warmongering elites who “don’t give a damn about people’s lives”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the time for the left to be initiating and, where possible, spearheading mass movements against the rightward slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left in the US is punching above its weight to hold its ground, using every chink in Trump’s armour to put up a promising fight for democracy. In the absence of trustworthy support from the mainstream media, YouTube channels are abuzz with analysts and activists keeping Trump in their crosshairs. A white woman activist raging against MAGA’s nativism was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965792&quot;&gt;murdered&lt;/a&gt; by Trump’s hired guns from ICE. The killing in Minneapolis has set off a prairie fire across states. In the absence of vocal criticism of Trump from the Congress, the left, increasingly joined by Jewish students and senior scholars, is intervening strategically to ensure that Trump gets his comeuppance in the November mid-term polls and thereby can be reined in from doing further damage. Regardless of the outcome the left won’t be accused of sitting on its hands when America was dismembering democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil and Colombia have slammed Trump’s abduction of a fellow Latin American president from his home in Caracas. Trump’s toolkit for Iran is different. A colour revolution is being quelled, says Pepe Escobar, a well-regarded Brazilian observer of the Middle East. Regardless of the images posted in Western media, Escobar says the Iranian leadership is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966486&quot;&gt;braced&lt;/a&gt; for another round of war with US and Israel, only this time better prepared. It is a testament to the feckless ways of the left that a group like Mujahideen-i-Khalq, which was instrumental in deposing the Shah of Iran, has become a catspaw for Israeli and US intrusion in its own country. Veteran Iran watchers are sanguine that without the organisational skills and a well-oiled machinery of the deeply camouflaged Mujahideen-i-Khalq, Reza Pahlavi, the former crown prince would have no standing with the rioters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf has also been jolted by the events in Venezuela. “We are entering an era where international guarantees are fragile, institutions are weakened and power speaks louder than principle. Awareness today is not a luxury; it is a requirement for survival,” &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.arabnews.com/node/2628571&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cautioned&lt;/a&gt; Saudi Arabia’s &lt;em&gt;Arab News&lt;/em&gt;. It stressed that the seizure of Russian funds in Western banks was a betrayal of crucial trust that the world took for granted. “The lesson is clear. The time to act is now.” Interestingly, the writer in the Saudi paper is prominent UAE businessman Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor. It says something for the thread that still unifies the two countries despite their recent aloofness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Asia is inevitably deeply affected by the turn of events unfolding at breakneck speed in the Middle East and in Latin America. Pakistan, currently in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962789&quot;&gt;good books&lt;/a&gt; of Trump (for no palpable reason), has spoken out boldly on the heist in Venezuela, with its defence minister reportedly calling for the abduction of Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu by the US (instead of Nicolás Maduro who should be freed). Bangladesh has witnessed street protests for Nicolás Maduro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, India, once a champion of lost causes in the Global South has been slow poisoned into becoming a basket case by its leaders seeking anchor in the West. When George W. Bush was in bad odour right across the world, a PEW survey said India was the rare country where Bush was popular. What does that say about the current leadership? Pulverised as a stag caught in the headlights of an approaching truck, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has left his foreign policy to the tender care of hope and prayer. What excites him, however, is any lurking campaign to win another state election, or even a municipal poll, preferably by communally polarising voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi’s calendar this year perhaps captures the essence of his preferences and fears. To cheer him, assembly polls are due in opposition-ruled West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in May. On the other hand, he is to host the BRICS summit around August, which comes with the terror of having to take an unequivocal stand on Trump’s thuggery and India’s one-sided love with the US. In the meantime, China, Russia and Iran began a week of joint naval exercises in South Africa’s waters on Saturday. The ‘BRICS Plus operation’ would “ensure the safety of shipping and maritime economic activities”. The sleeves have been rolled up, mostly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BD standoff exposes ICC’s governance crisis ahead of T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966651/bd-standoff-exposes-iccs-governance-crisis-ahead-of-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WITH less than three weeks to go before the T20 World Cup starts, the cricketing world looks on as the sport’s global governing body deals with yet another crisis. The latest, too, involves India — the country from where the International Cricket Council’s chairman and the CEO come from — naturally as the co-hosts of the 20-team showpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh don’t want to play their matches in India and want them to be shifted to co-hosts Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have come to this point after worsening political relations between the two countries over the last 12 months saw Bangladesh’s star pacer Mustafizur Rahman being withdrawn from Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders’ squad on the directives of the country’s cricket board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia cited “recent developments” as the reason for Mustafizur’s ouster. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) responded strongly, deciding not to play in India with security having become a major concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the BCB said on Wednesday that the “ICC has conveyed its willingness to work closely” with the board to resolve the issue, the latter itself has chosen to not comment on the issue with reports emerging on Monday that Chennai and Thirivananthapuram have been put forward as venue to host Bangladesh’s matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also remains a possibility of Bangladesh not participating in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICC, while trying to negotiate with the BCB, has not been able to show any kind of muscle as a governing body, especially against the host nation’s board for letting cricket be affected by politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises question marks over the ICC’s standing as a governing body in the face of India’s dominance via producing the major chunk of revenue that runs it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body is led by Bharatiya Janata Party leader and India’s Home Minister Amit Shah’s son Jay, while ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta is also Indian. As former ICC president and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ehsan Mani views it, “the BCCI follows the political agenda of the BJP”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The ICC should have a clear policy of not allowing member countries’ politics to interfere with the game,” he told Dawn last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the involvement of politics in the making of the decisions that run the sport as the most important concern, Mani claimed other strong cricket boards were not serious about taking it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, ECB [England and Wales Cricket Board] and CA [Cricket Australia] together with BCCI are not prepared to address this and other serious governance issues and together they have prevented ICC from carrying out a governance review which I was pushing for as chairman of PCB,” he said. “The ICC board is terribly conflicted, with each director looking after his country’s interest before considering what is good for the game as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mani said he expected the Bangladesh situation to be resolved through “a fudged solution, which will be engineered without addressing the governance failings of the ICC”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) chairman Dave Cameron, who served in the ICC’s Finance and Com­mercial Affairs committee between 2013-19, echoed Mani’s views, saying that the ICC needed to switch from being “a group of members” to becoming a proper governing body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Part of the challenge is that the ICC is not a governing council but is rather made up of countries that sit together as a members’ group, and this is unfortunate,” Cameron told Dawn. “As a governing council, there are some requirements, it’s not being used in that way, which is the detriment at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PAKISTAN’S OPPORTUNITY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not the first time that security concerns triggered by political tensions between India and another country have come to put a tournament at risk. When India hosted the 50-over Cricket World Cup in 2023, the PCB was convinced days before the event to send the national team across the border. A stronger deadlock emerged ahead of last year’s Champions Trophy — of which the official hosts were Pakis­tan — with India refusing to return their neighbours’ 2023 gesture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICC had to come up with a “hybrid model” to resolve the Champions Trophy matter and decided that Pakistan and India will play at neutral venues if the global tournament is being hosted by either of the two nations. That decision was hailed as Pakistan’s psychological win in the backdrop of the Indian financial and administrative muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent political shift in Bangladesh triggered by Sheikh Hasina’s ouster as the country’s prime minister and a consequential change of regime in the BCB, the PCB, led by Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, has got closer to the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naqvi — also the Asian Cricket Council chief currently — and BCB president Aminul Islam were also reportedly at the forefront in making the 2025 Asia Cup happen amid calls for a boycott coming from India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former PCB chairman Najam Sethi, who himself has been in the midst of the Pakistan-India cricket issues during his previous tenure, the ongoing tensions are an opportunity for the PCB to form a pressure bloc within the ICC along with the BCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Earlier, on any issue, Pakistan could not count on support from any ICC member if its stance differed from India’s, now it will have Bangladesh on its side,” Sethi told Dawn. “Their joint clout will be greater than the sum of their parts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan cricket leadership seemed to have sensed the opportunity after Mustafizur was snubbed by the BCCI as it the PCB announced zealously days after the fast bowler’s registration for the Pakistan Super League’s players’ draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media feeds on Sunday, meanwhile, carried unconfirmed reports of the PCB offering to host Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup matches in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“PCB and BCB should scratch each other’s shoulders in their respective leagues to cobble a common front against the rest of the Boards,” Sethi said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Monday evening, BCCI secretary Saikia, as per reports, confirmed no communication was made by the ICC over a potential change of venues for the Bangladesh matches. Henceforth, as the clock ticked and the T20 World Cup neared, uncertainty prevailed and so did the ICC’s deafening silence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In 2024, following a movement led by the students in Bangladesh, and after the Awami League president and then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina went into exile in India, a wave of arrests of Awami League leaders and activists began across the country. During that very crackdown, Proloy was arrested, and several cases were filed against him.</description>

      <title>Alternate venues in India floated for Bangladesh’s World Cup matches: report</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966566/alternate-venues-in-india-floated-for-bangladeshs-world-cup-matches-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram have been floated as potential alternate venues for Bangladesh to play their matches in the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup 2026, which is being hosted by India, according to &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/137229/chennai-thiruvananthapuram-emerge-as-options-for-bangladeshs-world-cup-matches&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cricbuzz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/a&gt; the International Cricket Council (ICC) shift its games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a report by &lt;em&gt;Cricbuzz&lt;/em&gt; published on Sunday, there is no resolution on whether Bangladesh will travel to India to play its scheduled matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reported that alternative venues are being explored by the ICC and “it is unlikely they will be in Sri Lanka where Bangladesh insist on playing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been learnt that Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) and Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) have been sounded out by the ICC and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the co-hosts of the World Cup and the option of moving Bangladesh’s games to Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram are being explored,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It noted that neither TNCA nor KCA officials could be reached for comment, but that “it is learnt that they have expressed willingness to host the games”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“TNCA officials are believed to have told the ICC and BCCI that they will have no problem as they have eight pitches,” the report added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://sports.ndtv.com/t20-world-cup-2026/bcci-reacts-to-iccs-2-venue-solution-to-bangladesh-t20-world-cup-row-10720805&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;NDTV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia as saying on Monday that the BCCI had not recieved any update from the ICC regarding a reported shift in venue for Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup matches, stating that it was a matter of discussion between the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BCCI has not received any communication regarding the matter of shifting Bangladesh matches to Chennai or anywhere else, and it is beyond our control,“ he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a matter of communication between the BCB and the ICC, as the ICC is the governing body. If the ICC conveys any decision to us regarding a change of venue, the BCCI, as the host, will take the necessary steps. At present, we are not privy to any such information,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The United Nations&apos; top court will begin hearing a landmark genocide case against Myanmar on January 12, 2026. Gambia brought the case against the Southeast Asian country, accusing it of genocide of its Muslim Rohingya minority in the western Rakhine region in 2017. At least 730,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh after the violence. Myanmar has denied the accusation of genocide, saying at a preliminary hearing in 2019 that the accusations were misleading.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Australia has tightened checks for student visa applicants from India, moving it to the ‘highest risk’ category along with Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan, according to Australian and Indian media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times of India&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://t.co/S3HcITkPAu&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday that the re-rating of the countries was out of cycle, quoting Australian media, while the administration said this was triggered by “emerging integrity risks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;TOI&lt;/em&gt; report, the administration did not cite any specific reason for which India had been assigned to a new category. However, it added that the move came after reports of “fake degree busts” in India which had reached international media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Assessment levels influence not only the documentary burden but also how easily prospective students can plan to study in Australia, according to &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theaustraliatoday.com.au/australia-tightens-international-student-integrity-checks-puts-india-nepal-and-bangladesh-into-highest-risk-countries/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Australia Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Higher levels typically require more extensive proof of finances, English proficiency and genuine temporary entrant intentions, among other criteria. These changes can slow processing times, increase applicant costs and discourage applicants if perceived as overly burdensome,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that international education stakeholder groups had stressed that clarity and predictability are essential, especially for countries that contribute significant student numbers and economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India, in particular, is one of Australia’s largest source markets for international students, it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Australian outlet, experts say the latest changes may lead to closer scrutiny of applications from South Asia, but also stress that genuine students still have pathways to study in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Department of Education and Home Affairs is expected to publish detailed guidance for providers and agents explaining the basis for the updates and how documentation requirements will be implemented in practice, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The sector will be watching closely for official documents that could explain whether the Assessment Level changes are temporary or if they signal a longer-term shift in how Australia manages risk across major international student source markets,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#fraudulent-applications&quot; id=&quot;fraudulent-applications&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fraudulent applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Authorities have seen evidence of a rise in suspected fraudulent documentation — both financial and academic — from certain source countries during recent visits to South Asia,” &lt;em&gt;The Australia Today&lt;/em&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia’s Minister for International Education Julian Hill, reportedly described Australia as having become “the least worst country of choice amongst the Big Four” destinations for international students — referring to global competitors such as the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hill said that this had prompted a stronger emphasis on documentary evidence and risk filtering to protect visa integrity, the Australian outlet reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;The Times of India&lt;/em&gt; said that according to experts, Australia now remained the only option among these destinations, as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1937854&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959178&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1952938&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; were shutting their doors to foreign students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It recently became obvious that student applicants who couldn’t get into those other three countries are increasingly applying to come to Australia, and in many cases we’ve seen an increase in fraudulent financial and academic documents,” &lt;em&gt;TOI&lt;/em&gt; quoted Phil Honeywood, chief executive officer of the International Education Association of Australia (IEAA), as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By placing a number of these countries into the highest risk rating level, it automatically enhances any filtering of the student visa applicants to ensure bona fide study motivation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#concerns-over-ambiguity&quot; id=&quot;concerns-over-ambiguity&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Concerns over ambiguity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some in the sector acknowledge the importance of maintaining rigour against fraud, the sudden jump in assessment levels — particularly the broad move of multiple large source countries such as India and Bangladesh to AL3 — has prompted questions about how risk is being measured and communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Australia Today&lt;/em&gt; reported that Honeywood had raised concerns about the timing and frequency of assessment level changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that ambiguity around shifting risk categories was affecting education providers at a critical point in the academic calendar during the first intake of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the outlet, he said that he had had a “long discussion” with Minister Hill about the sector’s concerns, “primarily with two aspects of the assessment level changes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First and foremost, the frequency of change is causing confusion among providers here and agents offshore. Secondly, at the very time we are trying to ensure a good start to the year intake, we appear again as though we are not quite sure which countries we seek to recruit from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honeywood added that educational institutions needed stability and clear policy signals to properly plan recruitment efforts, liaise with agents and support prospective students trying to understand evolving visa requirements, the outlet added.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan’s struggle to scale its exports</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966540/pakistans-struggle-to-scale-its-exports</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For nearly two decades, Pakistan’s exports have remained stuck between $25–30 billion, despite repeated declarations that export-led growth is central to economic revival. Over the same period, Bangladesh has crossed $50bn, while Vietnam now exceeds $350bn. This widening gap is not the result of global shocks or bad luck. It reflects domestic policy choices that have made exporting costly, uncertain, and unrewarding — while protecting inefficiency at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macroeconomic instability as a built-in disadvantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful exporters require stable costs and predictable policy. Pakistan offers neither. Recurrent balance-of-payments crises trigger abrupt stabilisation programmes, policy reversals, and stop-start incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchange-rate management has been particularly damaging. Periodic overvaluation to contain inflation acts as a hidden tax on exports, eroding competitiveness. When corrections eventually occur, they are sharp and disruptive, driving up input costs and debt servicing. Exporters are forced to operate in an environment where profitability can disappear overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exporters taxed as revenue sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s export sector faces one of the most punitive tax regimes in the region. Exporters pay advance income tax, minimum turnover tax, super tax, and multiple withholding taxes across supply chains, while sales tax and duty drawback refunds are routinely delayed. This effectively turns exporters into involuntary lenders to the state, tying up working capital and raising borrowing costs. Smaller and mid-sized exporters — essential for diversification — are hit hardest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In competing economies, exports are genuinely zero-rated, with automated refunds and minimal compliance burdens. In Pakistan, exporters are taxed first and refunded later — if at all — despite already having to self-provide basic infrastructure, security, and logistics. This fiscal approach treats exports as a short-term revenue stream rather than a long-term growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy costs that destroy competitiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High and unpredictable energy prices further undermine export viability. Industry cross-subsidises domestic consumers, absorbs losses from theft and inefficiency, and pays capacity charges for unused generation. Penalising captive power to force grid usage has reduced industrial flexibility while merely shifting circular debt from electricity to gas. Given Pakistan’s concentration in low value-added exports, where energy is a large cost component, this disadvantage is decisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low value-added exports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s export base remains narrow and low value. Textiles dominate, but largely at the yarn, fabric, and basic garment level — segments with thin margins and intense competition. Some firms have exited higher value-added apparel altogether, whilst others are contemplating relocating production abroad. By contrast, Bangladesh invested in scale, compliance, and female labour participation to move up the garment value chain, while Vietnam diversified into electronics, engineering, and services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global demand is also shifting away from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955933&quot;&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt; toward man-made fibres, weakening Pakistan’s traditional advantage. Without deliberate upgrading, innovation, and branding, export diversification will remain elusive — even as Pakistan’s land, water, and human capital offer opportunities in horticulture, livestock, dairy, seafood, minerals, information technology, and professional services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak standards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food and agricultural exports face persistent quality and hygiene challenges. Inadequate domestic testing facilities force exporters to rely on foreign laboratories, raising costs and delays. Training and certification infrastructure remain underdeveloped. While exporters are allowed to open overseas marketing offices, funding limits are too low to support brand development or to secure shelf space. As a result, Pakistani brands have minimal global presence outside diaspora markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protectionism that rewards inefficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High tariffs and ad-hoc import restrictions raise input costs and disrupt supply chains. Recent changes under the Export Facilitation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1914843&quot;&gt;Scheme&lt;/a&gt; — denying refunds on certain imported inputs — further penalise exporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protection has encouraged firms to prioritise secure domestic margins over global competitiveness. Medium-sized exporters, lacking inventory buffers, suffer most. Domestic consumers pay higher prices for lower-quality goods, while protected firms rarely evolve into serious exporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity and skills gaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No incentive can compensate for low productivity. Pakistani firms face unreliable energy, inefficient logistics, and shortages of technical, managerial, and digital skills. While Vietnam benefits from a disciplined workforce and Bangladesh from broad labour participation, Pakistan continues to underinvest in human capital limiting its ability to upgrade exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy inconsistency and weak credibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most damaging constraint is policy credibility. Export policies are announced without consultation, applied unevenly, and reversed under fiscal pressure. Temporary incentives and shifting rules discourage long-term investment. Export growth requires confidence that policies will endure beyond the next crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both the government and businesses must change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While policy failures dominate, the private sector also bears responsibility. Too many firms focus on lobbying for protection rather than investing in competitiveness, innovation, and new markets. Despite duty-free access to the European Union and UK, Pakistan’s textile market share has stagnated, while China and Vietnam, despite tariffs, have expanded through superior cost, quality, and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will not scale exports through episodic devaluations, temporary incentives, or punitive taxation disguised as reform. What is needed is macroeconomic stability, a predictable and competitive exchange rate, affordable energy, rationalised tariffs, a truly zero-rated export regime with automatic refunds, and sustained investment in skills. Until exports are treated as central to economic survival rather than a revenue afterthought, ambitious targets — such as $63bn — will remain out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Violence Against Hindus: Is Bangladesh Burying Its Founding Ideals Of Secularism And Pluralism?</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/violence-against-hindus-bangladesh-burying-its-founding-ideals-secularism-and-pluralism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For Bangladesh’s Hindus, each funeral deepens the message that their lives are negotiable and their suffering invisible. If this trajectory continues unchecked, the country risks normalizing a culture of impunity that will ultimately consume more than one community. Violence ignored does not fade; it spreads. And the price of silence, as history repeatedly shows, is always paid in lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SMOKERS’ CORNER: RELEASING THE PRESSURE</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966347/smokers-corner-releasing-the-pressure</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; Illustration by Abro &quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/69631f7eeca8a.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Illustration by Abro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentiment that ‘revolution was just around the corner’ serves as a poignant distillation of the 1960s ‘counterculture’ zeitgeist. It was a unique historical moment, where global currents of youthful middle-class dissent converged to create a sense of inevitability that the old order was about to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a distinct sense of melancholy attached to this sentiment today, stemming from the fact that the revolution never actually materialised. The capitalist structures and political hierarchies that drew the fire of youthful protestors proved resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survival of the status quo was largely due to the durability of the modern state. When pushed hard, governments effectively reinforced their ‘law and order’ platforms, a strategy that successfully appealed to a more cautious general public. They prioritised stability over radical change, allowing the state to reassert control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capitalism demonstrated a remarkable capacity to co-opt the rebellion. Instead of being dismantled by the ‘rebellion’, the market absorbed it, rapidly transforming the potent symbols of revolution into mass-produced commodities. This allowed individuals to buy the aesthetic of a revolutionary without ever actually threatening the financial institutions that issued them loans and credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite the political failures of the era’s uprisings, they did usher in some social shifts. As noted by the American sociologist Todd Gitlin, while the movements of the 1960s failed to topple governments, a “cultural revolution” effectively took root, fundamentally altering how society perceives authority, gender roles, racial dynamics and environmental stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the counterculture of the 1960s to today’s ‘Gen Z revolutions’, mass uprisings have repeatedly failed to dismantle power because the modern state has learned how to absorb dissent, co-opt its language and rebrand itself without changing its core&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is also true that the state gained a sophisticated understanding of how to manage dissent energised by middle-class youth. In the decades that followed, governments learned to neutralise modern, youth-led uprisings by absorbing their energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the American political scientist Christian Davenport, the evolution of state power since the 1970s has seen a sophisticated shift toward the “professionalisation of state survival”, moving away from blunt, reactive force in favour of nuanced containment. Modern states now prioritise strategies of co-optation and absorption, expertly identifying the leaders and aesthetic language of youth movements to bring them into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way of doing this is by inviting activists into ‘advisory’ committees. This aids the state to effectively dissipate radical energy through institutionalisation. The state then allows for symbolic concessions, such as the resignation of a single unpopular official. This satisfies the activists’ immediate hunger for change but without threatening the underlying power structure. The most recent example in this regard is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1928259&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/695984db0630f.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This management of dissent extends into the digital realm as well. The initial advantage held by youth activists in this area has been increasingly eclipsed by state-directed information management. And anyway, the digital landscape often gets flooded with a clutter of noises, so much so that a movement’s core message becomes diluted or misunderstood by the wider public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most post-1970s movements have taken on a bourgeoisie character. Therefore, the state strategically exploits the socio-economic stakes that the activists have in the existing system. Dissent has become the specialised vocation of the bourgeoisie. This is why it fails to achieve the critical mass necessary for systemic change. This is why, in most cases now, the state often treats dissent as a pressure valve to be managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1974 ‘Carnation Revolution’ against a fascist regime in Portugal is remembered as a popular uprising. It really wasn’t. According to the American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, it was a ‘top-down’ transition initiated by the military. It was a coup d’etat. By leading the change from within, the rebel officers ensured that the transition remained institutional and controlled, effectively neutralising the more revolutionary working class elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern, what Harvard University political scientist Tarek Masoud calls “decapitation without dismantling”, defines the subsequent ‘revolutions’ of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. In these instances, high-visibility, youth-led middle class protests succeeded in removing unpopular leaders, yet the underlying state machinery and power structures remained largely untouched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These uprisings functioned as pressure valves. Examples include 2003’s ‘Rose Revolution’ in Georgia, 2004’s ‘Orange Revolution’ in Ukraine, 2011’s ‘Arab Spring’ (2011), 2022’s ‘Sri Lankan Aragalaya’ and last year’s uprisings in Bangladesh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1941374&quot;&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1948680&quot;&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;. The newest trend in this regard are the so-called ‘Gen Z Revolutions.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases prove that, unless an uprising targets the entire administrative and economic infrastructure, the state will simply rebrand itself while maintaining the old power dynamics. Targeting the entire infrastructure hasn’t happened since the revolutions in France (1789), Russia (1917), China (1949), Cuba (1958), Nicaragua (1979) and Iran (1979).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American historian Crane Brinton established a rigorous “fever chart” for true revolutions, requiring a progression from the collapse of the old regime to a “Thermidor”, or the consolidation of an entirely new order. In contrast, most modern uprisings fail to reach this final stage. Learning from the upheavals of the 1960s, the state no longer tries to simply crush dissent. It manages it. By allowing an unpopular figurehead to be removed, the state provides a psychological victory to the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uprisings in this regard are better described as pressure valves than revolutions. When the media labels these events as ‘revolutions’, it misses the fact that the underlying power structure is often stronger the day after the uprising than it was the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is an excellent example of this. The power structure actually grew stronger after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279&quot;&gt;May 9, 2023&lt;/a&gt; uprising staged by the supporters of the now jailed populist Imran Khan. Such events function as pressure valves because they provide an outlet for the energy of middle-class youth. But this energy fails to crystallise into an actual revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called ‘Gen Z Revolutions’ will also eventually be absorbed back into the systems they ‘fought’. The old machinery will re-assert itself, often rebranding the same power under the new, popular language of the ‘revolution’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, while the term ‘pressure valve’ might suggest a failure to achieve total victory, this mechanism is arguably more vital to the long term health of a nation than a ‘Thermidorian’ revolution. The true danger of a systemic overthrow is the almost inevitable descent into a reign of terror or a vacuum of power that invites civil war, economic collapse, and permanent instability. Therefore, the preservation of certain deep-rooted instruments of the state are necessary for the survival of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By allowing pressure valves, these instruments allow for a change without destroying the hardware of the state. A society can move towards reform more effectively through incremental institutional change than through a total rupture that risks leaving the society in a state of permanent chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cricket concerns</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966327/cricket-concerns</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SCHEDULE uncertainty persists at yet another multilateral cricket tournament to be held in South Asia. Once again, it involves India, which has been intent on throwing its weight around. This time, though, it is getting a taste of its own medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a month before the Twenty20 World Cup is set to be played in India and Sri Lanka, Bangladesh have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;cited security reservations&lt;/a&gt; over travelling to India. The Bangladesh Cricket Board is, instead, in a discussion with the International Cricket Council about playing its matches in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its concerns have been triggered on account of worsening Dhaka-New Delhi ties and the recent events related to its fast bowler Mustafizur Rehman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur had been signed by the Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders, only for the Board of Control for Cricket in India to&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872&quot;&gt; ask the team to release him&lt;/a&gt; due to “recent developments”. The move sparked a furore in Dhaka, which banned the broadcast of the IPL in the country and asked the ICC to shift its World Cup matches from India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its argument is that when India cannot ensure Mustafizur’s safety, the only Bangladeshi played snapped up in the IPL auction, how can it guarantee the security of the entire team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Cup, beginning on Feb 7, is set for geopolitical strains again after Pakistan-India tensions eased with an arrangement which sees both teams play their matches at neutral venues during tournaments held in either country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will play their World Cup games in Sri Lanka, just like India played their Champions Trophy matches in the UAE last year. India has cited security concerns for not sending its team to Pakistan. Now, it has to address Bangladesh’s similar concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is imperative for the ICC, led by former Indian cricket supremo Jay Shah, to make an impartial decision instead of forcing Bangladesh to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘Battle-tested’: Pakistan arms exports surge after May conflict with India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966203/battle-tested-pakistan-arms-exports-surge-after-may-conflict-with-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the four-day conflict with India in May last year, Pakistan demonstrated not only the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910987&quot;&gt;effectiveness &lt;/a&gt;of Chinese military hardware, but also its own indigenously produced equipment, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1226734&quot;&gt;JF-17 Thunder&lt;/a&gt; fighter jet, the Al-Khalid main battle tank and the Fatah series guided multiple launch rocket system (G-MLRS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the JF-17‘s role in the May conflict and in the skirmish with India in 2019 proved the jet’s capabilities in battle. During last year’s war with India, the Thunder was credited with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909984&quot;&gt;destroying&lt;/a&gt; the state-of-the-art S-400 surface-to-missile system deployed by India at Adampur. The jet also made a strong showing at last year’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1956309&quot;&gt;Dubai Airshow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965472/absolutely-we-are-ready-asif-says-pakistan-can-confront-aggression-on-eastern-western-borders-simultaneously&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geo News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a brief timeline of arms deals that Pakistan has finalised or is currently discussing with friendly countries since May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#january-10-2026-iraqi-air-chief-expresses-keen-interest-in-jf-17&quot; id=&quot;january-10-2026-iraqi-air-chief-expresses-keen-interest-in-jf-17&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;January 10, 2026: Iraqi Air Chief expresses ‘keen interest’ in JF-17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 10, Iraqi Air Force Commander Lt Gen Staff Pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi praised the Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF) professionalism during the May conflict and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966192/iraqi-air-chief-praises-pafs-professionalism-expresses-keen-interest-in-jf-17-thunder-jets&quot;&gt;expressed interest&lt;/a&gt; in acquiring the battle-proven jets during a visit by PAF Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu to Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Lt Gen Al-Asadi expressed “interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed a keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets [and] Super Mushshak trainer aircraft”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was reported earlier this week that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert around $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942611/?utm_source=newskit_ai&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;mutual defence pact&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and that the total deal was worth $4 billion, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#january-6-bangladesh-expresses-interest-in-buying-jf-17s&quot; id=&quot;january-6-bangladesh-expresses-interest-in-buying-jf-17s&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;January 6: Bangladesh expresses interest in buying JF-17s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and Bangladesh’s air chiefs held detailed discussions on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;potential procurement&lt;/a&gt;” of JF-17 Thunder aircraft, ISPR said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Chief Marshal Sidhu briefed his Bangladeshi counterpart on the PAF’s recent advancements and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to supporting the Bangladesh Air Force through a comprehensive training framework from basic to advanced flying and specialised courses across PAF institutions, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He also assured fast-tracked delivery of Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, along with a complete training and long-term support ecosystem,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan signed a multi-billion-dollar deal to sell conventional military equipment to the Libyan army last month, entering a select club of countries that export conventional arms and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of the deal, which was seen by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; before it was finalised, listed the purchase of several JF-17 fighter jets and Super Mushak trainer aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Pakistani official told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the deal included the sale of equipment for land, sea and air, spread over two-and-a-half years, adding it could also include the JF-17 fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tarique Rahman&amp;#039;s Past Will Shadow His Nation&amp;#039;s Future:  Is Bangladesh Headed For Post-Election Conflict?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keen observers of international and regional politics will not have missed the tacit presence of the invisible hand of the US in determining the democratic transition in Bangladesh.  Obviously, TarIque had been &lt;em&gt;tutored&lt;/em&gt; by the Americans about the best way forward for the transition towards democratic rule and delivering on the promises of cooperation on regional security. The intelligentsia inside the country could have hoped for Tarique referring to ‘’historical’’ figures from the Indian subcontinent, the Muslim world, and Bangladesh’s past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JI emir warns against ‘blocking democratic pathways’</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966025/ji-emir-warns-against-blocking-democratic-pathways</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Jamaat-i-Islami Emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has warned the rulers that blocking democratic pathways and branding political dissent as treason will not resolve the country’s deepening crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The powerful must abandon manipulation through ‘RTS’ and ‘Form-47 tactics’ and stop imposing restrictions on the youth,” he said while addressing the participants of a training camp at Mansoora on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Pakistan is being held hostage by a class that thrives on corruption, oppression, falsehood and injustice. The “imposed elite”, he added, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/608164&quot;&gt;deprived&lt;/a&gt; the nation of basic rights such as education, healthcare and justice. Resisting the obsolete system and its protectors is a fundamental religious obligation, said Mr Rehman, asserting that his part will bring change through the strength of public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the rulers are fearful of the new generation, particularly Generation Z, and are systematically closing the doors of education and employment on them. He warned that widespread despair among the youth is pushing them toward &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1741126&quot;&gt;drug abuse&lt;/a&gt;. To counter this, he said, Alkhidmat Foundation and JI have expanded the “Bano Qabil” initiative into a comprehensive youth development project called ‘Z-Connect’, aimed at providing education, skills and moral training. “We will not allow our youth to become victims of systemic oppression,” he said, expressing confidence that genuine change would come through public support, especially the younger generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to Bangladesh, Rehman said the JI there faced decades of brutal repression, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1257512&quot;&gt;senior leaders executed&lt;/a&gt; and thousands of workers imprisoned under the rule of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s daughter, Sheikh Hasina. He said that Sheikh Mujib, along with Gen Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, played a central role in the breakup of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rehman said that public resentment against India has grown in Bangladesh. He said Bangladeshi people have set ablaze statues of Sheikh Mujib while Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, through patience and steadfast struggle, has emerged as a major political force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JI chief urged the participants to avoid sectarianism and cautioned against adopting traditions and customs that contradict the spirit of Islam, calling such practices a form of idolatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlighting social injustices, he said denial of women’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955572&quot;&gt;inheritance rights&lt;/a&gt; has become a norm in Pakistan, vowing that the JI would ensure women receive their rightful share.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>BCCI officials met in Mumbai to discuss the Centre of Excellence&apos;s operations and future India U-19 and India A tours. Regarding Bangladesh&apos;s T20 World Cup match venue request, the board stated it&apos;s not their domain, as the ICC holds the final decision.

      <title>FM Dar to head to Saudi Arabia for extraordinary meeting of OIC Council of Foreign Ministers</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966008/fm-dar-to-head-to-saudi-arabia-for-extraordinary-meeting-of-oic-council-of-foreign-ministers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will leave on Friday night for Saudi Arabia to attend an extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Council of Foreign Ministers, scheduled for Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting will discuss the implications of Israel’s recognition of Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The session will address the implications of Israel’s recognition of the so-called Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” read a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiserdeputy-prime-ministerforeign-minister-to-attend-extraordinary-session-of-oic-council-of-foreign-ministers-in-jeddah9-11-january-2026&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt;issued by the Foreign Office (FO) on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said the deputy prime minister will share Pakistan’s position on the issue of Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the sidelines, Dar will also hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from OIC member states to discuss further cooperation on regional and international issues, added the FO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somaliland enjoys a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1802522&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;strategic position&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Gulf of Aden and has its own currency, passport and army, but has struggled to win international recognition, amid fears of provoking Somalia and encouraging other separatist movements in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel became the first country to formally recognise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1878375/somalia-ethiopia-reach-deal-to-end-dispute-over-breakaway-region&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Somaliland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an independent and sovereign state, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965469&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;arrived &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in Somaliland for a high-profile visit, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”, after Israel recognised the breakaway region in the Horn of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and a wide selection of Muslim countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965837&quot;&gt;issued &lt;/a&gt;a joint statement on Thursday condemning the visit by the Israeli diplomat to Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement, issued by the FO, was issued on behalf of the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Gambia, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Türkiye and Yemen, as well as the OIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Pakistan joined 20 other nations and the OIC in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963725&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rejecting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Israel’s recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement underscored their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Mamdani penned the letter in early December after meeting Khalid&apos;s parents, who were visiting the United States in December last year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khalid’s parents shared the letter a few days ago, which has been circulating on social media platforms such as X and Instagram.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randhir Jaiswal from the external affairs ministry said in a public statement that Mamdani should focus on his own affairs rather than wading into another country&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“On the issue of comments made by the Mayor of New York [City], we expect public representatives to be respectful of the independence of judiciaries in other democracies,” Jaiswal said. “Expressing personal prejudices does not behoove those in office,&quot; he added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Instead of such comments, it would be better to focus on the responsibilities entrusted to them.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student activist Khalid has been held in prison without trial since September 2020, and is accused of being behind the New Delhi riots that took place in February 2020. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) considers Khalid as being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uscirf.gov/religious-prisoners-conscience/forb-victims-database/umar-khalid&quot;&gt;persecuted&lt;/a&gt; for &quot;protesting religious freedom conditions&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USCIRF &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uscirf.gov/news-room/releases-statements/indias-political-system-facilitates-intolerance-towards-religious&quot;&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; designating India as a &quot;Country of Particular Concern&quot; for its intolerance towards religious minorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khalid was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1967-37.pdf&quot;&gt;UAPA&lt;/a&gt;, a law that allows for prolonged detention and makes bail exceptionally difficult.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, India&apos;s Supreme Court rejected Khalid’s bail application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mamdani’s letter to Khalid reads, &quot;Dear Umar, I think of your words on bitterness often and the importance of not letting it consume one&apos;s self. It was a pleasure to meet your parents. We are all thinking of you,&quot; the letter reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight US lawmakers also wrote a letter to Indian ambassador Vinay Mohan Kwatra, dated 30 December, urging India to grant Khalid bail and a free trial “in accordance to international law”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democratic Congressman Jim McGovern, who is co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, shared the letter, which was also signed by Democratic Representatives Jamie Raskin, Pramila Jayapal, Jan Schakowsky, Lloyd Doggett and Rashida Tlaib; and Democratic Senators Chris Van Hollen and Peter Welch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McGovern and some of the others had also met Khalid&apos;s parents during their December visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;New Delhi riots&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Modi government changed the citizenship law to expedite citizenship for persecuted Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims in India protested against their exclusion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hindu right-wing mobs attacked peaceful sit-ins in New Delhi, which precipitated a deadly riot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 50 people, largely Muslims, were killed. It is perceived to be the most violent episode in New Delhi since the anti-Sikh riots of 1984.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian police arrested more than 2,000 people. The New Delhi Police, accused of bias against Muslims, arrested activists and students, many of them Muslim, accusing them of orchestrating the violence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least 18 student leaders and activists were arrested, including Khalid. Over the past five years, Khalid’s bail applications have been rejected repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International human rights organisations have repeatedly called for his release&lt;a href=&quot;http://release.on&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;On 5 January, some of the accused were released on bail, but not Khalid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Amnesty International said, “While we welcome the court’s decision to grant bail to their co-accused, it is shameful that Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam continue to be denied bail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Neither of these individuals should be in detention in the first place. They have been detained for more than five years without trial on politically motivated allegations - the charges against them should be dropped and their release should be unconditional.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FM Dar to leave for Saudi Arabia tonight to attend extraordinary meeting of OIC Council of Foreign Ministers</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966008/fm-dar-to-leave-for-saudi-arabia-tonight-to-attend-extraordinary-meeting-of-oic-council-of-foreign-ministers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will leave on Friday night for Saudi Arabia to attend an extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Council of Foreign Ministers, scheduled for Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting will discuss the implications of Israel’s recognition of Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The session will address the implications of Israel’s recognition of the so-called Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” read a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiserdeputy-prime-ministerforeign-minister-to-attend-extraordinary-session-of-oic-council-of-foreign-ministers-in-jeddah9-11-january-2026&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt;issued by the Foreign Office (FO) on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said the deputy prime minister will share Pakistan’s position on the issue of Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the sidelines, Dar will also hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from OIC member states to discuss further cooperation on regional and international issues, added the FO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somaliland enjoys a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1802522&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;strategic position&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Gulf of Aden and has its own currency, passport and army, but has struggled to win international recognition, amid fears of provoking Somalia and encouraging other separatist movements in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel became the first country to formally recognise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1878375/somalia-ethiopia-reach-deal-to-end-dispute-over-breakaway-region&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Somaliland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an independent and sovereign state, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965469&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;arrived &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in Somaliland for a high-profile visit, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”, after Israel recognised the breakaway region in the Horn of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and a wide selection of Muslim countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965837&quot;&gt;issued &lt;/a&gt;a joint statement on Thursday condemning the visit by the Israeli diplomat to Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement, issued by the FO, was issued on behalf of the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Gambia, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Türkiye and Yemen, as well as the OIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Pakistan joined 20 other nations and the OIC in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963725&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rejecting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Israel’s recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement underscored their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;span&gt;The lines between India’s foreign policy, domestic politics and economy will become increasingly blurred in 2026 &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Expert comment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;LToremark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2026-01-09T10:43:15+00:00&quot; title=&quot;Friday, 9 January, 2026&quot;&gt;9 January 2026&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It will become increasingly hard for the Modi government to offset foreign policy setbacks with domestic successes as the full impact of US tariffs starts to bite.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class=&quot;media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;img alt=&quot;India&apos;s Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrives to address the nation from the ramparts of the Red Fort in New Delhi.&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2026-01/2026-01-09-india-in-2026-2229378086.jpg?itok=ptDuQdkZ&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;2025 was arguably India’s most challenging foreign policy year. The four-day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/05/india-pakistan-ceasefire-remains-shaky-relations-unlikely-return-status-quo&quot; title=&quot;India–Pakistan ceasefire remains shaky, with relations unlikely to return to status quo&quot;&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; with Pakistan in May was followed by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/08/trumps-tariffs-put-strain-us-india-ties-relations-will-endure-long-run&quot; title=&quot;Trump’s tariffs put strain on US–India ties, but relations will endure in the long run &quot;&gt;downturn&lt;/a&gt; in India–US relations. The Trump administration imposed 50 per cent tariffs on India over its purchase of Russian crude and the failure to secure a trade deal by the agreed deadline. Adding insult to injury, Washington increased its outreach to Islamabad. There was also instability in India’s neighbourhood, including the so-called Gen Z protests in Nepal and a downturn in relations with Bangladesh after Sheikh Hasina was removed from power and fled to India in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Modi government sought to downplay these setbacks by pointing to successes on the domestic front, including electoral successes for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party in state elections, economic reforms – including reforms to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-2-0-is-here-what-the-new-tax-reforms-mean-for-you-10-things-to-know/articleshow/124038295.cms&quot;&gt;goods and services tax&lt;/a&gt; and new &lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/india-implements-four-labour-codes-replacing-29-laws-in-biggest-reform-since-independence/articleshow/125482920.cms&quot;&gt;labour codes&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;– and free trade deals with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/07/modi-visit-marks-elevation-india-uk-relationship-risks-and-ambiguities-remain&quot; title=&quot; Modi visit marks elevation of India–UK relationship, but risks and ambiguities remain&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, Oman and New Zealand. Despite the challenges of US tariffs, India remained the world’s fastest growing major economy, recording &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2209412&amp;amp;reg=3&amp;amp;lang=2&quot;&gt;8.2 per cent&lt;/a&gt; growth between July and September thanks in part to its large domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;align-right embedded-entity embed&quot;&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  


                          
                          
      &lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;h5 teaser__title&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trump’s tariffs put strain on US–India ties, but relations will endure in the long run &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        
      &lt;/header&gt;

                    
      
              
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in 2026 the lines between foreign policy, domestic politics and the economy are likely to become increasingly blurred. The latest GDP growth data was before the full force of Trump’s tariffs came into effect, so they will begin to have a more sustained impact on the economy the longer they remain in place. Washington is also considering additional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-president-trump-backs-russian-sanctions-bill-threatening-500-tariff-on-india-for-russian-oil-10507365&quot;&gt;sanctions&lt;/a&gt; on countries doing business with Russia. This economic impact could have a knock-on effect on the country’s politics as India will hold elections in four states and one Union Territory in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Modi government will be hoping that trade diversion efforts help alleviate some of these pressures. A key watchpoint will be the conclusion of a trade deal with the European Union, India’s leading trade partner. However, the negotiations have been on and off since 2007 and a deadline to conclude a trade deal by the end of last year was missed. Both sides will be seeking to conclude the deal ahead of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s visit to India later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Summit year&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;India will host a string of summits in 2026, including the AI Impact Summit in February, the BRICS summit and possibly the Quad summit, which was scheduled to take place last year but postponed amid the downturn in India–US relations. India will also be hosting several key world leaders. Following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/12/putins-india-visit-aims-reaffirm-new-delhi-moscow-relations-just-trump-applies-pressure&quot; title=&quot;Putin’s India visit aims to reaffirm New Delhi–Moscow relations – just as Trump applies pressure to downgrade them&quot;&gt;visit to India&lt;/a&gt; in December, Ursula Von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa will be chief guests at India’s Republic Day parade later this month. Chinese President Xi Jinping may visit India for the BRICS summit, and US President Donald Trump could visit India if the Quad summit goes ahead – and New Delhi and Washington are able to resolve their differences and secure a trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While New Delhi will argue these developments vindicate its multi-aligned foreign policy, the cracks in India’s longstanding commitment to strategic autonomy are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. India’s exclusion from the inaugural &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/12/pax-silica-initiative/&quot;&gt;summit &lt;/a&gt;of the Trump administration’s Pax Silica initiative in December was telling. India has long been touted as a beneficiary of the push to de-risk or diversify supply chains away from China but its exclusion from a key initiative on critical and emerging technologies signalled a weakening of this narrative.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India’s absence from the Pax Silica summit partially reflects the bad blood in the India–US relationship and Washington’s aversion to the vagaries of India’s strategic autonomy as it prefers to do business with more reliable partners. But it also shows that India is increasingly viewed as a secondary player in the development of critical and emerging technologies. Although US tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft have announced investment &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3w79pgn8peo&quot;&gt;commitments&lt;/a&gt; in India, much of this is in data centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This points to several structural challenges facing India in its ambition to become a global manufacturing hub. An example of this can be seen in the semiconductor space. India is an important player in terms of chip design and last year Modi &lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/made-in-india-chips-to-hit-market-by-2025-end-for-first-time-says-pm-modi/articleshow/123316826.cms&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that India would deliver its first domestically produced chips. However, this will largely focus on less advanced (trailing-edge) chips. Chip production also requires water and electricity – areas where India faces acute shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strategic autonomy under increasing scrutiny&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;India’s careful international balancing act was clear in its response to the US attack on Venezuela. Among BRICS members, India was the least vocal in its response to the attack and the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. Its Ministry of External Affairs issued a brief statement that expressed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/40566/Press_Release_on_recent_developments_in_Venezuela&quot;&gt;‘deep concern’&lt;/a&gt; about recent developments, while the government’s main focus has been to support and safeguard Indian nationals in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;align-left embedded-entity embed&quot;&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s muted response partially reflects its limited interests in Venezuela; India has reduced its import of Venezuelan crude in response to Western sanctions on the country. It also reflects a desire to stay on good terms with Washington and secure a trade deal. This echoes New Delhi’s muted response to other global flashpoints, including the conflicts in Gaza (to stay on good terms with Israel) and Ukraine (to stay on good terms with Russia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Indian foreign policy can often come across as &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/11/26/india-end-strategic-autonomy/?utm_content=gifting&amp;amp;tpcc=gifting_article&amp;amp;gifting_article=aW5kaWEtZW5kLXN0cmF0ZWdpYy1hdXRvbm9teQ%3D%3D&quot;&gt;aloof&lt;/a&gt;. It professes a commitment to the rules-based international order, including principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and the equality of states, but it is often quiet when it comes to upholding these principles. India claims to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38161/The_3rd_Voice_of_Global_South_Summit_2024&quot;&gt;‘voice’&lt;/a&gt; of the Global South, but when Venezuela is attacked, its response is slow and silent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>India and Bangladesh have begun the process to renew a landmark agreement on sharing the waters of the Ganges, as analysts warn political disputes and uncertainty over Dhaka’s general election could complicate talks between the two neighbours.
Officials from both sides have started joint measurements of water levels in the Ganges, or Padma as the river is known in Bangladesh, as part of preparations to renew the agreement signed in 1996 and due to expire in December this year, according to...</description>

      <title>Bangladesh: Where Blasphemy Is A Trigger To Weaponize Religion</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/bangladesh-where-blasphemy-trigger-weaponize-religion</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ruling governments in Bangladesh often seek to use these laws in various ways. Critical expression, especially criticism of the government or raising questions about religion, can be met with swift arrest and harassment through laws such as the Digital Security Act (DSA). In addition, allegations of religious blasphemy are used to pressure and marginalize political opponents, opposition parties, and dissenting voices. Religious extremist groups use these laws to promote their ideology or to intimidate people of different faiths or those who hold non-religious views.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Visa sections of 3 Bangladesh missions in India closed on security grounds</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965986/visa-sections-of-3-bangladesh-missions-in-india-closed-on-security-grounds</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The visa sections of three Bangladesh missions in India have been closed temporarily on security grounds, Foreign Affairs Adviser Touhid Hossain said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I have done is that I have asked our three missions to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It’s a security issue,” he told reporters at the foreign ministry, responding to a question on whether Bangladesh missions in India had restricted tourist visas for Indians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not name the missions. However, diplomatic sources said the visa sections of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, the Deputy High Commission in Kolkata, and the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visa sections at Bangladesh missions in Chennai and Mumbai, however, remain operational, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, protests have taken place near Bangladesh missions in India.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the ouster of the Awami League regime, the Indian High Commission restricted tourist visas to Bangladeshis, citing security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touhid was also asked about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964965&quot;&gt;dropping &lt;/a&gt;of Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman from the Indian Premier League amid anti-Bangladesh protests in India, and Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965735/bangladesh-says-icc-considering-request-to-move-their-world-cup-games-from-india&quot;&gt;decision &lt;/a&gt;not to send the national cricket team to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adviser said he fully supported Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul’s stance on not sending the team to India for safety reasons and demanding that Bangladesh’s matches be relocated to co-host Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will certainly play outside India,” Touhid said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that both players and supporters would have to travel to India and said the government must consider their security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the impact on bilateral relations, Touhid said such issues arise from time to time and each has some impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Bangladesh would take decisions based on its national interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have an interest in our players’ safety in not sending them to India. If we have interest in buying rice from India, we will buy it,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>T20 WC: &apos;Ball in Bangladesh&apos;s court&apos; - Indian govt assures warm welcome to all nations</title>

      <description>The Indian government is monitoring the Bangladesh situation regarding the T20 World Cup and will follow its sports policy of welcoming all participating nations. Bangladesh&apos;s decision to withdraw or relocate matches remains solely theirs, with India awaiting their final stance. Unlike Pakistan, where a specific sports policy exists, Bangladesh will receive full security if they choose to participate.</description>

      <title>Hafiz Naeem warns of simmering public anger</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965885/hafiz-naeem-warns-of-simmering-public-anger</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Jamaat-i-Islami Emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has warned that if the ruling elite continue to sustain the oppressive system and deny people their democratic right, public anger will erupt with consequences the powerful will be unable to contain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to the media after addressing the concluding ceremony of Bukhari Sharif at Jamia Markaz Uloom-e-Islamia on Thursday, Rehman demanded the establishment of a genuinely empowered local government system and the removal of all restrictions on democratic freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the country’s youth were being pushed into despair as access to education and employment continued to shrink, while electricity, gas and fuel prices were rising relentlessly. He criticised what he termed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1278512&quot;&gt;decaying judicial system&lt;/a&gt;, further weakened by amendments that had tightened the elite’s control, and said the economy remained trapped in an interest-based framework that benefitted only a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to the newly-introduced local government law in Punjab, he called it a black law imposed at a time when people were already struggling to survive. He said JI considered resistance against this unjust and exploitative system a national and moral obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Rehman cautioned rulers to read the situation carefully and address people’s grievances, warning that once public frustration turns into open revolt, force and weapons would not be able to suppress it. “When lawful avenues are blocked, people are pushed towards unlawful means,” he said, urging authorities to respect public opinion and restore people’s rightful voice in governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also criticised Pakistan’s ruling circles for their eagerness to seek the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963690&quot;&gt;favour &lt;/a&gt;of US President Donald Trump, despite his role in advancing a new colonial order, providing blanket protection to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu despite international court rulings, and actions against Venezuela’s leadership. He said Pakistan’s rulers must represent the aspirations of their own people instead of seeking foreign approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JI chief, earlier, urged religious scholars and students to rise above sectarian differences and unite the Ummah on common principles. He emphasised that spreading knowledge, strengthening outreach to ordinary people and accelerating the struggle for the establishment of Deen were among the most noble traditions of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaffirming JI’s commitment to peaceful political resistance, Mr Rehman cited the example of JI Bangladesh, saying that despite severe repression under Sheikh Hasina’s rule, steadfast and patient struggle ultimately forced the dictator to flee. He also referred to the resistance of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood as examples of resilience against oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan stands firmly with the people and will continue to raise its voice for their rights,” he said, adding that the struggle for the supremacy of a just and rightful system would be intensified.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan, Muslim countries ‘express strong condemnation’ of Israeli FM’s visit to Somaliland</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965837/pakistan-muslim-countries-express-strong-condemnation-of-israeli-fms-visit-to-somaliland</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and a wide selection of Muslim countries issued a joint statement on Thursday condemning a visit by Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar to Somaliland earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Saar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965469&quot;&gt;arrived &lt;/a&gt;in Somaliland for a high-profile visit, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”, after Israel recognised the breakaway region in the Horn of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement, issued by the Foreign Office (FO) today, was issued on behalf of the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Gambia, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Türkiye and Yemen, as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It recalled the earlier statement condemning Israeli recognition and “expressed strong condemnation” of the Israeli FM’s visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The said visit constitutes a clear violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and undermines established international norms and the United Nations Charter,” the joint statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/2009308304904712666&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reaffirmed the 22 countries’ unwavering support for the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Somalia and highlighted that “encouraging secessionist agendas are unacceptable and risk exacerbating tensions in an already fragile region”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Respect for international law, non-interference in [the] internal affairs of sovereign states, and adherence to diplomatic norms are essential for regional and international stability,” the joint statement added, commending Somalia’s commitment to peaceful international engagement, constructive diplomacy and international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement expressed the 22 countries’ commitment “in continuing to support diplomatic and legal measures taken by Somalia to safeguard its sovereignty, territorial integrity and stability in line with international law”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further stressed that Israel should respect Somalia’s sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity and honour its obligations in compliance with international law, further demanding that Tel Aviv immediately revoke its recognition of Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somaliland enjoys a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1802522&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;strategic position&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Gulf of Aden and has its own currency, passport and army, but has struggled to win international recognition, amid fears of provoking Somalia and encouraging other separatist movements in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel became the first country to formally recognise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1878375/somalia-ethiopia-reach-deal-to-end-dispute-over-breakaway-region&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Somaliland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an independent and sovereign state, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Pakistan joined 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963725&quot;&gt;rejecting&lt;/a&gt; Israel‘s recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement underscored their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh&apos;s interim government has temporarily suspended visa services at its key diplomatic missions in India, including New Delhi, citing &quot;security concerns.&quot; This move follows similar restrictions by India on Bangladeshi nationals. Dhaka is also seeking a reversal of United States visa bond requirement, deeming it &quot;certainly unfortunate and painful for them.&quot;</description>

      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965824/bangladesh-air-chief-discusses-enhancing-defence-cooperation-in-meetings-with-cdf-munir-naval-chief</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The air chief of Bangladesh on Thursday discussed avenues for enhancing defence cooperation with Pakistan in separate meetings with Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, and Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh Air Force Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Hasan Mahmood Khan called on CDF Munir at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7579&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the meeting, matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics and avenues for enhancing bilateral defence and military cooperation were discussed,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Both sides underscored the importance of strengthening professional collaboration, training exchanges and defence ties between the Armed Forces of Pakistan and Bangladesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the ISPR, ACM Khan lauded the “professionalism of Pakistan Armed Forces and appreciated their contributions towards regional peace and stability”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDF Munir reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to fostering enduring defence relations with Bangladesh. The ISPR said the meeting reflected the “longstanding and strong bonds between the two brotherly countries”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, ACM Khan called on Admiral Ashraf at the Naval Headquarters in Islamabad, the ISPR &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7578&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“​During the meeting, matters of mutual professional interest, evolving regional security paradigm, and avenues for further strengthening bilateral defence cooperation were discussed,” the ISPR said about their meeting as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​ACM Khan “acknowledged the high professional standards of Pakistan Navy and expressed his desire to enhance collaboration between the two brotherly nations’ armed forces”, the ISPR said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The dignitaries agreed on the importance of increasing the frequency of high-level exchanges and joint training exercises to foster greater synergy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naval chief highlighted the Pakistan Navy’s commitment to regional maritime peace and stability through its various initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bangladeshi air chief is leading a high-level defence delegation during his visit to Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He met with his Pakistani counterpart on Tuesday, wherein both air chiefs held detailed discussions on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;potential procurement&lt;/a&gt;” of JF-17 Thunder aircraft, ISPR said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​The ISPR highlighted that ACM Khan’s visit underscored the “deepening defence ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh, following the significant” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1954868/navy-chief-concludes-milestone-visit-to-bangladesh-meets-senior-military-leadership&quot;&gt;visit of Admiral Ashraf&lt;/a&gt; to Dhaka in November 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his visit to Bangladesh, Admiral Ashraf had met with Dhaka’s senior military leadership and discussed avenues to bolster defence cooperation, the Navy had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had termed his trip, which also encompassed visits to the National Defence College and the Bangladesh Naval Academy, a “milestone”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The defining feature of her public life, however, was one of the world’s longest-running and most bitter political feuds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than three decades Zia and her rival, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina&quot;&gt;Sheikh Hasina&lt;/a&gt; – now exiled in India following her resignation after a violent uprising in mid-2024 – contested the leadership of the south Asian nation, and sought to eclipse the other when in office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/08/khaleda-zia-obituary&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Direct Bangladesh-Pakistan flights to resume after 14 years</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965805/direct-bangladesh-pakistan-flights-to-resume-after-14-years</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh and Pakistan are to resume direct flights after more than a decade, Dhaka’s national airline said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biman Bangladesh Airlines is scheduled to fly its first Dhaka-Karachi flight on January 29 and will be operated twice weekly, the first regular flights since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are relaunching the Dhaka-Karachi route with two weekly flights,” airline manager Bosra Islam told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The resumption of direct flights will significantly improve connectivity between Bangladesh and Pakistan, supporting business travel, tourism, and family reunions,” Biman Bangladesh Airlines said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Travellers between Bangladesh and Pakistan must currently use connecting flights through Gulf hubs such as Dubai and Doha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargo ships had resumed sailing from Karachi to Bangladesh’s key port of Chittagong in November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963937&quot;&gt;expressed &lt;/a&gt;the hope that direct flights between Karachi and Dhaka would start in January, during a meeting with the Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during the rule of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, relations between the two countries improved markedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq travelled to Dhaka for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964271&quot;&gt;funeral &lt;/a&gt;of the country’s first female prime minister Khaleda Zia in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2025, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had also visitd Dhaka and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1936871/fm-dar-meets-bangladeshs-yunus-during-historic-visit-as-revitalising-saarc-comes-under-focus&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;met&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yunus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Pakistan&apos;s defence minister claims a surge in aircraft orders, potentially ending IMF reliance within six months. This follows a military standoff with India and discussions with Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia for JF-17 fighter jet deals. The Pak minister expressed strong confidence in these orders materializing, suggesting a significant boost to Pakistan&apos;s economy.</description>

States will always seek to secure their interests by exerting influence over their neighbors, and the more powerful the state, the greater the influence that it will seek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, sphere of influence strategies vary greatly, on spectrums between relative moderation and excess, humanity and cruelty, discreet pressure and open intimidation, and intelligence and stupidity; and the present policies of the Trump administration in the Western Hemisphere show disturbing signs of inclining towards the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/december-2-1823-seventh-annual-message-monroe-doctrine&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Monroe Doctrine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; too has varied greatly in the two centuries since it was first announced as core to U.S. foreign and security policy. Originally, it was no more than the stated determination to prevent Spain from re-establishing its imperial rule over its former colonies, or Britain and France taking them over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, the previous determination to exclude foreign empires morphed into a determination to prevent states in the Western Hemisphere from joining hostile military and political alliances; or if Washington was forced to concede this (as in the case of Cuba), to cripple the states concerned through economic sanctions and subversion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This longstanding U.S. strategy renders absurd the NATO and European line concerning Ukraine that “every country has the right to choose its international alliances,” and that no other country has a veto over this. And of course, this rule extends far beyond the U.S. and Latin America, or Russia and Ukraine. Whatever its legal or moral “right,” Vietnam would be very ill-advised to join a military alliance with the U.S. against China, as would Bangladesh if it joined a Chinese alliance against India. Or as one Kazakh official once told me when the U.S. was seeking a security relationship with his country, “Every sensible Kazakh has a map in his head; and what that map shows is that Russia is there, and China is there, and Kazakhstan is in the middle. And the U.S. is not on that map.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implacable U.S. goal of preventing a hostile military presence in the Americas has been pursued by both Republican and Democratic administrations; and though the result for populations in the region was often monstrous oppression and suffering, this strategy did succeed in excluding potential military adversaries from America’s neighborhood. No Latin American government today is dreaming of inviting the Chinese or Russians to establish bases on their territories. Nor would Beijing and Moscow accept such an invitation. For they all know very well how ferocious and overwhelming would be the U.S. response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has not prevented actors in the U.S. from repeatedly using an alleged Soviet/Russian/Chinese threat to argue U.S. policies that they have in fact sought for quite different reasons. The single most dreadful example of this was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=32372#:~:text=Examines%20the%20impact%20and%20role,land%20held%20by%20United%20Fruit.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;role&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the United Fruit Company and its allies in the Eisenhower administration in creating the 1954 coup in Guatemala in order to block a moderate land reform, leading to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Guatemala/Civil-war-years&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;civil war&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which tens of thousands of indigenous Maya people were &lt;a href=&quot;https://hmh.org/library/research/genocide-in-guatemala-guide/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;slaughtered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S.-backed military regime in what would today undoubtedly be called a “genocide.” The parallel with Trump’s desire that U.S. corporations should develop Venezuela’s oil is all too obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, a non-existent “alliance” between the Venezuelan regime and China is being used as an excuse for the overthrow of that regime; and the feral hostility of the Cuba emigre lobby and its representatives in the U.S. administration to the existing Cuban state has nothing to do with any real security threat from Cuba, and everything with their own inherited hatreds and ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much further will the Trump administration go? The “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/06/world/video/what-is-the-donroe-doctrine-digvid-vrtc&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Donroe Doctrine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” explicitly returns to the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/roosevelt-corollary-to-monroe-doctrine/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Roosevelt Corollary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” of 1904 that expanded the Monroe Doctrine to assert the U.S. right to exercise “international police power” to intervene in the internal affairs of Latin American states if they show “chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far however, while Trump has declared that the U.S. will “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9enjeey3go&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;run Venezuela&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” he has stopped short of previous U.S. administrations of the first half of the 20th century in that he has not sought to invade and occupy Venezuela. Instead, the kidnapping of President Maduro seems intended to frighten the existing Venezuelan regime into submitting to Trump’s will, especially when it comes to U.S. control of Venezuela’s oil; not just for profit, but for leverage against Russia and China. By cutting off much of Cuba’s oil imports, it might also enable the U.S. to starve Cuba into surrender, allowing Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s relatives to return “home” and regain the property that they lost in the Cuban Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem about trying to run client regimes in this way is: What do you do if they threaten to collapse? This is the dilemma that the U.S. faced in Vietnam, in Iran in 1979, and in Afghanistan by 2020, and the Soviet Union faced in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan, and Russia faced in Ukraine in 2014. Double down or quit? That is to say, allow your clients to collapse, with the resulting damage to your interests and your “credibility,” or send in your own troops to try to ensure their survival?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the great majority of cases where the U.S. has chosen the latter course, the results have been disastrous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one critical instance, the official statements of the Trump administration go much further than the Roosevelt Corollary, which begins with “It is not true that the United States feels any land hunger…as regards the other nations of the Western Hemisphere” (though this would have come as a surprise to the Spanish and Panamanians). Trump and senior Trump officials by contrast have repeatedly emphasised their desire to annex &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0zg974v1o&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greenland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and (less seriously) &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/7282450/trump-annex-canada-economy-recession-upholding-the-constitution/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Canada&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And Canada and Denmark are neither enemies nor dysfunctional dictatorships, but successful democracies and the closest of U.S. allies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump and his team should take note of the Danish prime minister’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/post/204933/donald-trump-greenland-nato-danish-prime-minister&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;warning&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that a seizure of Greenland would “end NATO.” They should also look at how the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 destroyed any chance of continued Russian influence over Ukraine; and how China’s demand for the whole of the South China Sea frightened all of its neighbors, including ones previously well-disposed towards China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China drove its neighbors into Washington’s arms. Trump risks driving America’s neighbors into the arms of China. The Trump administration also needs to remember that U.S. economic influence in Latin America is vastly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-influence-latin-america-argentina-brazil-venezuela-security-energy-bri&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reduced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. was by far the greatest trading partner and investor in South America. Now it is China, which has also greatly increased its role in Central America. This gives countries significant opportunities to resist U.S. economic pressure; and if the U.S. tries to destroy their increasingly vital economic ties with China, it will create a backlash that will undermine or even destroy its sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is an issue of diplomatic tone. It has often been said, and rightly, that Russia weakened its influence over its neighbors by the bullying tone in which its officials often stated Russian demands. Even Russian officials at their worst however would be hard put to match the coarse, smirking &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/atrupar/status/2008318519142686860?s=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;arrogance of Stephen Miller&lt;/a&gt; on the subject of the U.S. demand for Greenland. Miller clearly sees himself as an old-style imperialist. He should read a real old imperialist, Rudyard Kipling:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If, drunk with sight of power, we loose&lt;br /&gt;Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,&lt;br /&gt;Such boastings as the Gentiles use,&lt;br /&gt;Or lesser breeds without the Law—&lt;br /&gt;Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,&lt;br /&gt;Lest we forget—lest we forget!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Kipling, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46780/recessional&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Recessional&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/06/world/video/what-is-the-donroe-doctrine-digvid-vrtc&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Donroe Doctrine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” explicitly returns to the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/roosevelt-corollary-to-monroe-doctrine/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Roosevelt Corollary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” of 1904 that expanded the Monroe Doctrine to assert the U.S. right to exercise “international police power” to intervene in the internal affairs of Latin American states if they show “chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far however, while Trump has declared that the U.S. will “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9enjeey3go&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;run Venezuela&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” he has stopped short of previous U.S. administrations of the first half of the 20th century in that he has not sought to invade and occupy Venezuela. Instead, the kidnapping of President Maduro seems intended to frighten the existing Venezuelan regime into submitting to Trump’s will, especially when it comes to U.S. control of Venezuela’s oil; not just for profit, but for leverage against Russia and China. By cutting off much of Cuba’s oil imports, it might also enable the U.S. to starve Cuba into surrender, allowing Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s relatives to return “home” and regain the property that they lost in the Cuban Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem about trying to run client regimes in this way is: What do you do if they threaten to collapse? This is the dilemma that the U.S. faced in Vietnam, in Iran in 1979, and in Afghanistan by 2020, and the Soviet Union faced in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan, and Russia faced in Ukraine in 2014. Double down or quit? That is to say, allow your clients to collapse, with the resulting damage to your interests and your “credibility,” or send in your own troops to try to ensure their survival?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the great majority of cases where the U.S. has chosen the latter course, the results have been disastrous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one critical instance, the official statements of the Trump administration go much further than the Roosevelt Corollary, which begins with “It is not true that the United States feels any land hunger…as regards the other nations of the Western Hemisphere” (though this would have come as a surprise to the Spanish and Panamanians). Trump and senior Trump officials by contrast have repeatedly emphasised their desire to annex &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0zg974v1o&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greenland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and (less seriously) &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/7282450/trump-annex-canada-economy-recession-upholding-the-constitution/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Canada&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And Canada and Denmark are neither enemies nor dysfunctional dictatorships, but successful democracies and the closest of U.S. allies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump and his team should take note of the Danish prime minister’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/post/204933/donald-trump-greenland-nato-danish-prime-minister&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;warning&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that a seizure of Greenland would “end NATO.” They should also look at how the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 destroyed any chance of continued Russian influence over Ukraine; and how China’s demand for the whole of the South China Sea frightened all of its neighbors, including ones previously well-disposed towards China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China drove its neighbors into Washington’s arms. Trump risks driving America’s neighbors into the arms of China. The Trump administration also needs to remember that U.S. economic influence in Latin America is vastly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-influence-latin-america-argentina-brazil-venezuela-security-energy-bri&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reduced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. was by far the greatest trading partner and investor in South America. Now it is China, which has also greatly increased its role in Central America. This gives countries significant opportunities to resist U.S. economic pressure; and if the U.S. tries to destroy their increasingly vital economic ties with China, it will create a backlash that will undermine or even destroy its sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is an issue of diplomatic tone. It has often been said, and rightly, that Russia weakened its influence over its neighbors by the bullying tone in which its officials often stated Russian demands. Even Russian officials at their worst however would be hard put to match the coarse, smirking &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/atrupar/status/2008318519142686860?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;arrogance of Stephen &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Miller on the subject of the U.S. demand for Greenland. Miller clearly sees himself as an old-style imperialist. He should read a real old imperialist, Rudyard Kipling:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If, drunk with sight of power, we loose&lt;br /&gt;Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,&lt;br /&gt;Such boastings as the Gentiles use,&lt;br /&gt;Or lesser breeds without the Law—&lt;br /&gt;Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,&lt;br /&gt;Lest we forget—lest we forget!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Kipling, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46780/recessional&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Recessional&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Remittances: boon or bane?</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965744/remittances-boon-or-bane</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CONCERNS are often expressed about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1960238&quot;&gt;expanding&lt;/a&gt; role of workers’ remittances in the ec­­onomy. They typically focus on the perceived risks of brain drain, excessive consumption, imp­ort leakage, exchange-rate overvaluation and the possibility of Dutch Disease. In contrast, empirical evidence shows that remittances contribute substantially to socioeconomic development. A stable source of external inflows, they help build foreign-exchange buffers, reduce dependence on external borrowing, support financial sector deepening and enhance macroeconomic stability by easing pressure on the current account. They play a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963602&quot;&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; role in poverty reduction, narrowing income inequalities and strengthening human capital by financing education, healthcare and housing. In times of economic stress, they are vital lifelines for households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also evidence of skill upgrading among those preparing to migrate and among returnees, resulting in brain gain effects. Studies show that overseas job opportunities have encouraged the Philippines to train more nurses and India to produce more computer scientists, actually increasing the stock of skilled workers at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misconceptions about remittances largely stem from the way workers’ remittances are treated statistically and methodologically under WTO’s General Agreement on Trade in Services and IMF’s Balance of Payments (BOP) framework. GATS classifies services according to the service provider’s nationality. Under Mode 4, a service supplier is considered foreign, irrespective of the duration of stay abroad. But the IMF defines workers’ services on a residency basis. If an individual lives abroad for over a year, he/she is treated as the host country’s resident, and transactions between residents are excluded from exports of services in the current account, being recorded, instead, under secondary income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOP treatment also creates inconsistencies with System of National Accounts, under which gross national savings consist of: a) gross domestic savings — household, corporate and public-sector savings; b) net transfers from abroad. In FY2025, Pakistan’s gross national savings amounted to 14.1 per cent of GDP, and gross domestic savings only 6.3pc. With net foreign savings positive, reflected in a current-account surplus of 0.5pc of GDP, a substantial share of domestic investment was effectively financed by savings of overseas Pakistanis. Recognising this gap, a UN technical subgroup on the movement of persons is working to integrate BOP services accounts with remittances for a more complete representation of workers’ services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absorbing new labour force entrants domestically is increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, Pakistan’s labour market can be segmented in the same way as goods markets — one serving international and the other domestic demand. If labour services exports are added to other service exports using the GATS framework, our total export of goods and services would amount to around $79 billion rather than $41bn under the IMF’s definition, without altering the overall current-account balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is useful to examine the main concerns regarding remittances more closely. First, the issue of brain drain. Pakistan adds nearly two million new entrants to its labour force each year; around half migrate. Available data indicates that only 2.6pc of the 832,000 migrants are highly qualified and 5.3pc highly skilled. Despite this outflow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957383&quot;&gt;unemployment&lt;/a&gt; and underemployment continue to rise. Graduate unemployment is estimated to range between 23 and 33pc. If labour supply were genuinely shrinking, real wages should have increased. Instead, studies over the past decade show a decline in real wages across all categories, with the sharpest among degree holders. Notably, during Covid, when migration slowed, real wages showed upward movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Pakistan’s large youth population, absorbing new labour force entrants domestically is increasingly difficult under current growth trends. In contrast, aging economies such as Japan, Korea and Germany face rising dependency ratios and labour shortages. So, it’s natural for labour-surplus countries to supply manpower to labour-deficient economies. Our policy response should focus on negotiating country-specific labour agreements and aligning training programmes with overseas demand. This requires investment in technical, vocational, language, and lifestyle skills besides work discipline and ethics. International accreditation from recognised institutions such as City &amp;amp; Guilds should be pursued and professionals encouraged to qualify through international exams in engineering, medicine, IT, accountancy and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, evidence doesn’t support concerns that remittance-receiving households indulge in excessive consumption and stimulate imports. Surveys and field observations show that recipients invest in better education for their children, improved nutrition, immunisation, and healthcare; switch to cleaner cooking fuels; upgrade housing conditions; and improve access to electricity and potable water. These changes lead to better social indicators, reduced poverty, and narrower income differentials. Districts such as Jhe­lum, Chakwal, and Rawalpindi — major sources of overseas workers — now rank high in literacy, school enrolment, and poverty reduction. Food expenditure accounts for about 40pc of total household spending, while a significant share of remittances goes towards housing improvements, farmland, real estate and consumer durables. Many returnees from GCC countries use their capital and skills to establish small businesses, contributing to domestic economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, remittances are often blamed for exchange-rate appreciation through the Dutch Disease effect. However, Dutch Disease arises from unearned rents or windfall gains from natural resources rather than incomes earned through labour services’ export. Evidence doesn’t support this concern. In FY2025, remittances increased by 22pc, yet the exchange rate was stable and foreign-exchange reserves increased. Similarly, Bangladesh has not experienced a sustained loss of export competitiveness despite rising remittance inflows. Exchange-rate appreciation occurs primarily when reserve accumulation is not sterilised, leading to the monetary base’s expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, studies indicate that remittances do not have a significant or sustained impact on domestic inflation. The outcome depends largely on country-specific economic structures. Gains in small-scale agriculture and livestock can expand supply and offset demand pressures. As households rise above the poverty line, increased consumption is directed primarily at domestically produced goods — meat, milk, poultry, fruit, vegetables — rather than imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, import demand is driven mainly by structural and policy-induced constraints rather than remittance inflows. These include deindustrialisation; failure to develop base industries that supply raw materials to downstream sectors; inefficient allocation of natural gas towards domestic consumption instead of industrial use; excessive protection through high tariffs; inability to save nearly $10bn annually by substituting imports of food and cotton; overregulation and excessive taxation; and underinvestment in agricultural research and development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan, Saudi in talks on JF-17 jets-for-loans deal: Reuters report</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965650/pakistan-saudi-in-talks-on-jf-17-jets-for-loans-deal-reuters-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources said, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942611/?utm_source=newskit_ai&quot;&gt;mutual defence pact&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks underscore how the two allies are moving to operationalise defence cooperation at a time of acute financial strain and as Saudi Arabia is reshaping its security partnerships to hedge against uncertainty about US commitments in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mutual defence deal was signed following Israel’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1940759&quot;&gt;strikes &lt;/a&gt;on what it said were Hamas targets in Doha, an attack that shook the Gulf region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan, while the second said the jets were the primary option among others under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first source said the total deal was worth $4bn, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources close to the military with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu was in Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks, including on “military cooperation between the two sides”, Saudi media outlet &lt;em&gt;SaudiNews50&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/SaudiNews50/status/2008608443943518656&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;on social media platform X on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#tested-in-combat&quot; id=&quot;tested-in-combat&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tested in combat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amir Masood, a retired air marshal and analyst, said Pakistan was in talks about or had finalised deals with six countries to provide equipment, including JF-17s and electronic and weapons systems for the jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said those countries included Saudi Arabia, but could not confirm any details about the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JF-17’s marketability has been increased because “it is tested and has been used in combat,” he told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, adding that it’s also cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aircraft was deployed during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials&quot;&gt;conflict with India&lt;/a&gt; last May, the heaviest fighting between the neighbours in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military or finance and defence ministries did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;Reuters’&lt;/em&gt; requests for comment. Saudi Arabia’s government media office also did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mutual defence pact, signed in September, committed both sides to treat any aggression against either country as an attack on both, significantly deepening a decades-old security partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has long provided military support to the kingdom, including training and advisory deployments, while Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stepped in to support Pakistan financially during periods of economic stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Riyadh announced a $6bn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1440974&quot;&gt;support package&lt;/a&gt; for Pakistan, including a $3bn deposit at the central bank and $3bn worth of oil supplies on deferred payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959240&quot;&gt;rolled over&lt;/a&gt; deposits multiple times, including a $1.2bn deferment last year, helping Islamabad stabilise its foreign exchange reserves amid chronic balance-of-payments pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#arms-sales-outreach&quot; id=&quot;arms-sales-outreach&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Arms sales outreach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has in recent months stepped up defence outreach as it seeks to expand arms exports and monetise its domestic defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Islamabad &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962754&quot;&gt;struck &lt;/a&gt;a weapons deal worth more than $4bn with Libya’s eastern-based Libyan National Army, officials said, one of the country’s largest-ever arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;held talks&lt;/a&gt; with Bangladesh on the possible sale of JF-17s, as it widens its arms supply ambitions beyond South Asia and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965472/absolutely-we-are-ready-asif-says-pakistan-can-confront-aggression-on-eastern-western-borders-simultaneously&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geo News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is currently under a $7bn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1860850&quot;&gt;IMF programme&lt;/a&gt;, its 24th, which followed a short-term &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1762360&quot;&gt;$3bn deal &lt;/a&gt;that helped avert a sovereign default in 2023. It secured the Fund’s support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Former Bangladesh batter Rajin Saleh recalled receiving crucial batting advice from Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly during a difficult 2004 series against India. Tendulkar advised him to mentally reset after each innings, while Ganguly urged him to play fearlessly. Saleh then scored in the 80s in the next match, crediting their support.</description>

      <title>Pakistan, Saudi in talks on JF-17 jets-for-loans deal, sources say</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965650/pakistan-saudi-in-talks-on-jf-17-jets-for-loans-deal-sources-say</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources said, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942611/?utm_source=newskit_ai&quot;&gt;mutual defence pact&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks underscore how the two allies are moving to operationalise defence cooperation at a time of acute financial strain and as Saudi Arabia is reshaping its security partnerships to hedge against uncertainty about US commitments in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mutual defence deal was signed following Israel’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1940759&quot;&gt;strikes &lt;/a&gt;on what it said were Hamas targets in Doha, an attack that shook the Gulf region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan, while the second said the jets were the primary option among others under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first source said the total deal was worth $4bn, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources close to the military with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu was in Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks, including on “military cooperation between the two sides”, Saudi media outlet SaudiNews50 &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/SaudiNews50/status/2008608443943518656&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;on social media platform X on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#tested-in-combat&quot; id=&quot;tested-in-combat&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tested in combat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amir Masood, a retired air marshal and analyst, said Pakistan was in talks about or had finalised deals with six countries to provide equipment, including JF-17s and electronic and weapons systems for the jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said those countries included Saudi Arabia, but could not confirm any details about the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JF-17’s marketability has been increased because “it is tested and has been used in combat,” he told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, adding that it’s also cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aircraft was deployed during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials&quot;&gt;conflict with India&lt;/a&gt; last May, the heaviest fighting between the neighbours in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military or finance and defence ministries did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;Reuters’&lt;/em&gt; requests for comment. Saudi Arabia’s government media office also did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mutual defence pact, signed in September, committed both sides to treat any aggression against either country as an attack on both, significantly deepening a decades-old security partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has long provided military support to the kingdom, including training and advisory deployments, while Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stepped in to support Pakistan financially during periods of economic stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Riyadh announced a $6bn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1440974&quot;&gt;support package&lt;/a&gt; for Pakistan, including a $3bn deposit at the central bank and $3bn worth of oil supplies on deferred payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959240&quot;&gt;rolled over&lt;/a&gt; deposits multiple times, including a $1.2bn deferment last year, helping Islamabad stabilise its foreign exchange reserves amid chronic balance-of-payments pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#arms-sales-outreach&quot; id=&quot;arms-sales-outreach&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Arms sales outreach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has in recent months stepped up defence outreach as it seeks to expand arms exports and monetise its domestic defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Islamabad &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962754&quot;&gt;struck &lt;/a&gt;a weapons deal worth more than $4bn with Libya’s eastern-based Libyan National Army, officials said, one of the country’s largest-ever arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;held talks&lt;/a&gt; with Bangladesh on the possible sale of JF-17s, as it widens its arms supply ambitions beyond South Asia and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965472/absolutely-we-are-ready-asif-says-pakistan-can-confront-aggression-on-eastern-western-borders-simultaneously&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geo News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Shikhar Dhawan condemned the brutal assault on a Hindu widow in Bangladesh, calling the violence unacceptable.

      <title>Bangladesh in talks with ICC over fate of T20 World Cup games</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965634/bangladesh-in-talks-with-icc-over-fate-of-t20-world-cup-games</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh cricket said on Wednesday it was in talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC) for a “practical” solution to its request to move its T20 World Cup matches out of India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872&quot;&gt;forced&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman to quit the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Saturday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965259&quot;&gt;prompting anger&lt;/a&gt; in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ties tense between the two countries, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;Bangladesh wants&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their World Cup games from India to co-hosts Sri Lanka, citing security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Cup begins on February 7 and Bangladesh are scheduled to play their four group matches in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official Nazmul Abedeen Fahim told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; today that talks were ongoing with the ICC “regarding security issues”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BCB statement said it would “continue constructive engagement with the ICC and relevant event authorities”, seeking an “affable and practical solution that ensures the smooth and successful participation of the team”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB said it was “firmly committed to placing the highest priority on the safety, security and well-being” of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC has not commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh international Mustafizur was snapped up at the IPL auction in December by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964862&quot;&gt;Kolkata Knight Riders&lt;/a&gt; for more than $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he was let go on the Indian cricket board’s “advice” after what it called “recent developments”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations between India and Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957625&quot;&gt;soured&lt;/a&gt; after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mea.gov.in/media-briefings.htm?dtl/40559/Transcript+of+Weekly+Media+Briefing+by+the+Official+Spokesperson+December+26+2025&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;condemned&lt;/a&gt; what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh police say ex-councillor was behind Hadi’s murder</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965562/bangladesh-police-say-ex-councillor-was-behind-hadis-murder</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Inqilab Moncho spokesperson Sharif Osman Hadi was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928&quot;&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; on the instructions of Taijul Islam Chowdhury Bappi, a former councillor of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) Ward-6, said Shafikul Islam, additional commissioner of the Detective Branch (DB) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bappi is also the organising secretary of the Dhaka City North unit of Jubo League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafikul disclosed the information at a press conference held at the DMP Media Centre this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the DB has submitted a charge sheet against 17 people, including prime accused Faisal Karim Masud, in connection with Hadi’s murder. Of the accused, 12 have already been arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DB official said the investigation revealed that Faisal is a member of the banned Bangladesh Chhatra League and that Hadi was killed in an act of political vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to a question, Shafikul said Faisal and his associate Alamgir Sheikh carried out the killing on Bappi’s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi, an aspiring candidate for Dhaka-8 and a prominent youth leader during last year’s July uprising, was shot in the Paltan area on December 12. He died on December 18 while undergoing treatment in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 14, Inqilab Moncho Member Secretary Abdullah Al Jaber filed an attempted murder case with Paltan Model Police Station against Faisal and several unnamed individuals, which later turned into a murder case. The case was subsequently transferred to the DB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman has registered for the Pakistan Super League (PSL) draft following his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964965&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the Indian Premier League (IPL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old left-arm pacer, known for his variations and death-over bowling, was acquired by Kolkata for INR 9.20 crore in the IPL mini-auction held in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was the only Bangladesh player signed for the season. On Saturday, Kolkata announced his release after receiving instructions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia cited “recent developments” as the reason, without providing further details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision comes amid strained relations between India and Bangladesh, linked to reports of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Bangladesh has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965259&quot;&gt;banned IPL broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; in the country and the Bangladesh Cricket Board has requested the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965099&quot;&gt;ICC to shift&lt;/a&gt; its T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has played in multiple IPL seasons since 2016 and taken over 60 wickets in the league, previously featured in the PSL for Lahore Qalandars. The PSL has confirmed his registration for the upcoming edition, with the draft expected soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter was jointly developed by China and Pakistan. The fighter has proved its combat capabilities during two military conflicts with India in 2019 and 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press release issued by ISPR said Bangladesh Air Force Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan called on Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu in Islamabad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bangladeshi air chief led a high-level defence delegation during the visit, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The meeting focused on strengthening operational cooperation and institutional synergy, with emphasis on training, capacity building, and collaboration in aerospace advancements,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the press release, the visiting air chief was accorded a guard of honour.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Chief Marshal Sidhu briefed his Bangladeshi counterpart on PAF’s recent advancements and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to supporting Bangladesh Air Force through a comprehensive training framework from basic to advanced flying and specialised courses across PAF institutions, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He also assured fast-tracked delivery of Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, along with a complete training and long-term support ecosystem,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bangladeshi air chief praised PAF’s combat record and expressed interest in benefiting from its operational expertise, seeking assistance in maintenance support for Bangladesh Air Force’s aging fleet and integration of air defence radar systems to enhance air surveillance,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Detailed discussions were also held on the potential procurement of JF-17 Thunder aircraft,” it said, adding that the delegation also visited key PAF facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The visit underscored the strong historical ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh and reflected a shared resolve to deepen defence cooperation and build a long-term strategic partnership,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rs 9.20 cr at stake? Mustafizur set to walk away empty-handed after KKR release</title>

      <description>Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman is unlikely to get paid by Kolkata Knight Riders after his IPL contract termination. Despite being a high-value signing, his release, not due to injury or misconduct, leaves him unprotected by insurance and contractual clauses. This situation highlights player rights issues and potential legal avenues for the bowler.</description>

      <title>Trump’s overplayed hand</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965423/trumps-overplayed-hand</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;IT’S useful to know the lay of the land that Donald Trump sought to breach with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964860&quot;&gt;kidnapping&lt;/a&gt; of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. Is there a power vacuum after Maduro’s exit? Evidently not. Will the Bolivarian republic crumble before the firepower of America? Unlikely, in view of the fact that too much Russian, Chinese and Iranian investment has gone into buttressing Bolivarian rule for it to be easily scuttled. Remember that Hugo Chávez was also kidnapped in a coup staged by the CIA. But his people rallied and Chávez returned to lead the country until his mysterious early death. Tariq Ali, in his memoirs, &lt;em&gt;You Can’t Please All&lt;/em&gt; has a chapter on his meetings with Chávez and Maduro. It’s titled “Was Hugo Chávez murdered?” There’s a distinct possibility his cancer was induced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story, however, is about Donald Trump’s fear of Brics and his suspicion of the Bolivarian revolution Chávez launched after his electoral victory in Venezuela in 1998. This has irked the West. In this sense, the story hasn’t really moved forward since the Anglo-American Operation Ajax toppled Mohammad Mosaddegh’s elected government in Iran in 1953. That was about oil. Last week’s kidnapping of Maduro is also about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965198&quot;&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; even if the Trump administration is rowing back from its claim of running Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What role is Brics playing to worry Trump, so much so that two key Brics members, Iran and Venezuela, are in America’s constant crosshairs? They are both heavily sanctioned countries. With Brics becoming a cohesive financial and economic platform, the hold of sanctions as a tool of US coercion would most likely be rendered ineffective, a key worry for the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chávez’s Bolivarian revolution needs to be understood nicely for a good reason. Chávez leaned heavily on Simón Bolívar’s ideals of Latin American unity, sovereignty, and anti-imperialism. Simón Bolívar was the 19th-century liberator who led South America’s independence from Spain. However, dozens of roads and landmarks in the US and other Western countries are named after Bolívar. Chávez plotted something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know how many Venezuelans were killed. But there was resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nehru inaugurated a Simón Bolívar Road in Delhi’s diplomatic enclave in 1955. Bolívar inspired Nehru’s Non-aligned Movement and Third World solidarity. To the right-wing Narendra Modi government, the road would be an embarrassment. It was evident in the foreign ministry’s tame response to Trump’s attack on a Brics country. “Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation.” Thus spake the Brics host for later this year. In neighbouring Bangladesh, people took to the streets to protest the heist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has strong reasons to want to oust the Bolivarian republic. Chávez rewrote the constitution that established new rights, strengthened the executive, and allowed for re-election. Funded by oil revenue, he launched vast social programmes targeting poverty. These included free community healthcare, staffed initially by Cuban doctors; a massive literacy campaign; a mission for subsidised food, housing, and university education. A Qadhafi-like irritant but in the Western hemisphere, a challenge to the Monroe Doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his adventurous attack on Venezuela, Trump looked like a quack dressed as a handyman assigned the task of staunching America’s slide as a Great Power. His bombing raids on seven nations last year defined his view of Pax Americana. His targets were Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Syria, Nigeria, Somalia and Venezuela. For all that and more, including the supervision of Israeli &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942547&quot;&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt; of Palestinians, he demanded the Nobel Peace Prize, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1947881&quot;&gt;went&lt;/a&gt; instead to a female Venezuelan dissenter who Trump cheered first but has distanced himself from after last week’s removal of Maduro to New York. Seymour Hersh noted that the bombings were inflicted without significant complaint from the Republican-led Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easily the most significant concern for the US is the Venezuelan state taking control of key sectors of oil, telecommunications, electricity, steel, and cement. The constitution is committed to the redistribution of large, unused estates to peasants. Currency and price controls are implemented to combat capital flight and inflation, though they also contributed to economic distortions. Venezuela under Chávez/Maduro pursued Latin American integration outside US influence, promoting the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America and offering subsidised oil for Caribbean nations. The revolution aimed to fundamentally transform Venezuelan society, moving it away from the neoliberal, two-party system that had dominated since 1958 and towards a model of ‘21st century socialism’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, the news about the dangerous military intervention was used to highlight American intelligence and military prowess instead. Stories were circulated about the derring-do of the elite Delta Force commandos who seized Maduro and his wife by bombing their way into his heavily guarded palace. However, Cuba is mourning the death of 32 Cuban guards who were protecting the first family. They were killed in the air and ground mission. We don’t know how many Vene­zuelans were killed. But there was resistance, and that resistance is believed to be the signal for a rehearsed plan to turn a swoop on Venezuelan resources into a nightmare for Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensing the resistance, Trump threatened Venezuela’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, with the fate of her president. Tapped to take control of the country after Maduro’s removal to the US, Rodríguez has claimed that the operation to arrest him had a “Zionist tinge”. She warned that “the extremists who have promoted armed aggression against our country — history and justice will make them pay”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What role could Israel have played in the assault on a distant country? Not very different from the role that Iran has as a strategic ally of Bolivarian Venezuela. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar was quick to congratulate Trump, saying the US “acted as the leader of the free world”. But Trump’s ties with Israel have split his MAGA base. As he struggles to keep his majority in both Houses of Congress in polls due in November, Trump may have overplayed his hand in using the military to fix runaway domestic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: A Bangladesh commission investigating disappearances during the rule of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina said Monday at least 287 people were assumed to have been killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission said some corpses were believed to have been dumped in rivers, including the Buriganga in the capital, Dhaka, or buried in mass graves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government-appointed commission, formed after a mass uprising in August 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; Hasina, said it had investigated 1,569 cases of abductions, with 287 of the victims presumed dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have identified several unmarked graves in several places where the bodies were presumably buried,” Nur Khan Liton, a commission member, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The commission has recommended that Bangladesh seek cooperation from forensic experts to identify the bodies and collect and preserve DNA samples from family members.” In its final report, submitted to the government on Sunday, the commission said that security forces had acted under the command of Hasina and her top officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report said many of those abducted had belonged to the country’s largest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, or the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), both in opposition to Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate investigation, police in December began exhuming a mass grave in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and China issued a joint communique on Monday calling for more “visible and verifiable” actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan, and prevent them from using Kabul’s territory for militancy against any other country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement came after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965195/pakistan-china-reaffirm-bond-amid-regional-tensions&quot;&gt;conclusion&lt;/a&gt; of the 7th round of the Pakistan-China Foreign Mini­sters’ Strategic Dialogue, for which Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar travelled to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two sides called for more visible and verifiable actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan which continue to pose serious threats to regional and global security, and prevent terrorist organisations from using the Afghan territory for terrorism against any other country and to endanger any other country,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two sides agreed to keep in close communication and coordination on the Afghan issue, work with the international community to encourage the Afghan government to build an inclusive political framework, adopt moderate policies, focus on development, pursue good-neighbourliness, and play a constructive role in helping Afghanistan achieve stable development and integrate into the international community,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement also said that China commended the measures taken by Islamabad to combat terrorism and protect the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“China fully recognised the significant contributions and huge sacrifices that Pakistan made in combating terrorism over the years,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two sides reiterated their commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations with zero tolerance, and agreed to further deepen all-round cooperation on counter-terrorism and security, and make concerted efforts to ensure that the China-Pakistan Belt and Road cooperation advances in a secure and smooth manner,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Calling on the international community to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation, the two sides expressed their firm opposition to double standards on counterterrorism,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both countries also expressed the readiness to continue leveraging the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral foreign ministers’ dialogue and the China-Bangladesh-Pakistan cooperation mechanism to “deliver new outcomes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#pak-china-agree-to-enhance-communication&quot; id=&quot;pak-china-agree-to-enhance-communication&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pak-China agree to enhance communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the communique, during the dialogue in Beijing, the two sides engaged in a “thorough exchange of views on bilateral relations and cooperation in wide-ranging areas, including strategic and political cooperation, as well as cooperation on defence and security, economy, trade, investment, and cultural and people-to-people exchanges”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and China “agreed to enhance strategic communication, deepen strategic mutual trust, jointly safeguard their common interests, promote the economic and social development of the two countries,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also called for the safeguarding and advancing “peace, development and prosperity of the region and beyond”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and China also marked the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, with the launch of commemorative activities, the communique said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that the anniversary was an “opportunity to consolidate China-Pakistan friendship and expand new areas of cooperation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan also congratulated China on the “successful conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan” under the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan also lauded China for its “people-centred development philosophy”, the communique said, adding that Pakistan also believed that the “Chinese path to modernisation provided a new option and practical solution for other developing countries to achieve independent development”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China also commended Pakistani leadership on “leading the country to achieve macroeconomic stability and to lay a solid foundation for national economic growth centred on Pakistan’s National Economic Transformation Plan (2024-2029) (URAAN Pakistan) and for its people to share the fruits of development and prosperity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan also reiterated its “firm commitment” to the one-China principle, stating that Taiwan is an “inalienable part of China’s territory”, the communique said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan firmly supports every effort of China to achieve national reunification, and opposes any form of ‘Taiwan independence‘ and any attempt to create ’two Chinas’ or ’one China, one Taiwan,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also added that “Pakistan firmly supports China on the issues concerning Xinjiang, Xizang, Hong Kong and the South China Sea”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement further added that China also “reiterated its steadfast support for Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China also renewed its commitment to supporting Pakistan in “pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions and achieving economic prosperity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country also vowed to support “Pakistan in firmly combating terrorism and playing a bigger role in international and regional affairs”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#upgraded-version-of-cpec&quot; id=&quot;upgraded-version-of-cpec&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Upgraded version of CPEC’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communique further said that the two sides also reached an agreement to “build an upgraded version 2.0” of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They agreed to “further align their development plans and priorities”, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the communique, the two nations outlined three key sectors: industry, agriculture, and mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also called for pushing for the “building and operation of the Gwadar Port, smooth passage of the Karakoram Highway, and enhancing Pakistan’s capacity for sustainable development”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two nations pledged to “deepen cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, information technology, science and technology, cybersecurity, technical and vocational training and education, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the course of the dialogue, it was also decided that the two countries will “take the year-round opening of the Khunjerab Pass as an opportunity to deepen two-way trade and people-to-people exchanges”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also agreed to “welcome third-party participation in CPEC cooperation that conforms with the modalities set by China and Pakistan”, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two countries also agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the financial and banking sectors, including extending mutual support at regional and international multilateral financial forums, the communique added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan appreciated China for providing support for its fiscal and financial sectors,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their cooperation in the field of space, the two sides “expressed satisfaction at their expanding space cooperation and for the expected early entrance of Pakistani astronauts into the China Space Station”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They agreed to explore space in a peaceful and mutually beneficial manner for greater economic and social development and prosperity,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, China &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1952137&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it was going to arrange for a Pakistani astronaut to perform short-term missions as part of China’s space station missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment towards upholding UN principles and international law, vowing to “oppose the plotted resurgence of fascism and militarism”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They expressed “support for the postwar international order underpinned by international legal documents such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation and other principles of international law for the maintenance of world peace and security, and protect historical truth and international justice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also underscored the significance of a South Asian “regional order underpinned by the UN Charter, international law, and the basic norms governing international relations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and China also reiterated their “opposition to any unilateral actions, and reaffirmed the significance of maintaining peace and stability in South Asia and the necessity of resolving all outstanding disputes through dialogue and consultation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the dialogue, Pakistan informed China of the latest developments in occupied Kashmir, with the latter reiterating that the dispute should be resolved “properly and peacefully in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the communique, the two countries “expressed readiness to conduct trans-boundary water resources cooperation under the principle of equality and mutual benefit”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also “emphasised the imperative of fulfilling international legal obligations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that the “significance of the maintenance of international and regional security and stability was reiterated”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and China also “reaffirmed their readiness to further enhance cooperation under the frameworks of the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Civilisation Initiative and the Global Governance Initiative”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides reaffirmed their commitment towards making the “global governance system more just and equitable, and join hands to build a community with a shared future for humanity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan highly commended China’s efforts to safeguard developing countries’ right to sustainable development,” the joint communique said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two sides expressed satisfaction over their cooperation within multilateral mechanisms such as the UN and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, they agreed to “deepen coordination and collaboration to safeguard the common interests of developing countries and international fairness and justice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and China also renewed their “commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, their support for multilateralism and free trade, and their opposition to hegemonism, bullying behaviours violating national sovereignty of other countries, the forming of ‘small circles’ and bloc confrontation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communique said that China commended Pakistan on its “outstanding performance during its UN Security Council presidency”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also voiced “full support for Pakistan to work as the rotating president of the SCO from 2026 to 2027”, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#reiterate-support-for-palestinian-state&quot; id=&quot;reiterate-support-for-palestinian-state&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reiterate support for Palestinian state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the issue of Palestine, Pakistan and China called for an “unconditional, comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza” and stressed the significance of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two countries called for the “implementation of the two-state solution with the establishment of an independent state of Palestine”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two sides also expressed their concern at the situation in the occupied West Bank, and urged the need for urgently addressing it,” the communique said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that Pakistan and China also “expressed willingness to work with the international community to make unremitting efforts for peace and stability in the Middle East”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, Dar thanked his counterpart for the “warm hospitality accorded to him and his delegation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two sides agreed to hold the next round of Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Islamabad next year on mutually convenient dates,” the communique concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#dar-meets-mining-delegation-visits-embassy&quot; id=&quot;dar-meets-mining-delegation-visits-embassy&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dar meets mining delegation, visits embassy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his visit to Beijing, the foreign minister also met with a delegation from China Minmetals Corporation (MCC) led by its Vice President Xu Jiqing, the FO said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FO said that the pair “held productive discussions on MCC’s ongoing and upcoming projects in Pakistan”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, Dar reaffirmed “Pakistan’s strong support for MCC in advancing mining investment and promoting value-added industrial development”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, they “lauded CIDCA’s contributions to Pakistan’s development”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pair also reaffirmed their commitment to deepening cooperation in education, space, livelihoods, IT, and disaster relief, including flagship initiatives to mark the 75th anniversary of Pakistan–China diplomatic relations.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Opposition leader’s appointment: PTI chief whip submits documents pertaining to Omar Ayub’s cases to NA speaker</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965254/opposition-leaders-appointment-pti-chief-whip-submits-documents-pertaining-to-omar-ayubs-cases-to-na-speaker</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PTI Chief Whip Amir Dogar, shared with National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Monday documents pertaining to the withdrawal of cases concerning PTI’s Omar Ayub and again demanded Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party Chairperson Mehmood Khan Achakzai’s appointment as the opposition leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes around a month after the NA Secretariat sent a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959934&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Dogar, seeking details about the status of cases concerning Ayub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter said the provision of the details in writing is necessary for the completion of the process for the appointment of an opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NAofPakistan/status/2008122399464821086&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a post on the NA’s X account, Dogar presented the documents to Sadiq today, and the two also exchanged views on matters related to the appointment of the opposition leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogar “once again” demanded that the Achakzai be appointed as the opposition leader, the post said, adding that Ayaz gave the assurance that “everything will be done in accordance with the law and the constitution”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement further quoted Ayaz as saying that he would share information with the house on the matter at the next NA session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The process for the appointment of the opposition leader will be initiated afresh,” he said, adding that the rules of the NA regarding the appointment of the opposition leader were clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post of the opposition leader in the NA has been vacant since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1928901&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;disqualification&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in August last year by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in connection with his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conviction&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the May 9 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same month, incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1932053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;nominated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Achakzai for the post of opposition leader and despite the PTI‘s insistence for his appointment, his notification remains pending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Ayub had challenged his disqualification in the Supreme Court (SC). But, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951715&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;withdrew his plea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his part, Sadiq had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1953709&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;maintained&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; regarding the delay in the appointment of a new opposition leader that the matter was “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against his disqualification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its letter to Dogar last month, the NA Secretariat stated that the opposition had mentioned in Parliament that Ayub’s cases were not sub judice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, this fact was not conveyed to the secretariat in writing,” the letter said, requesting that the current status of the cases in which the secretariat had been made a party be communicated to it in writing for the completion of the “prescribed process of the declaration of leader of the opposition in the National Assembly”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#no-formal-contact-for-talks&quot; id=&quot;no-formal-contact-for-talks&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘No formal contact for talks’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, NA Speaker Sadiq said that the opposition had not yet made formal contact for initiating talks with the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the remarks while speaking to the media, according to a handout issued by the NA Secretariat. It quoted him as saying that the “opposition had not yet made any formal contact to initiate a dialogue”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My role in the talks is only that of a facilitator,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadiq further stated that the committee system in the lower house of Parliament was fully functional as per constitutional requirements, adding that he was “completely independent” in his position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of the appointment of the NA opposition leader, Sadiq said that four letters had been sent to the opposition’s chief whip in this regard. He said that after the fourth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964060&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;, the opposition had submitted a certified copy of their decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NAofPakistan/status/2008085665448419481&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader will be initiated in the next parliamentary session,” Sadiq said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the process will move forward “after checking and verification of the signatures of the opposition members”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reiterated his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962792&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;offer for talks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, at a recent national conference organised by the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) opposition alliance, participants had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962585/door-to-talks-must-never-be-shut-ttap&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;agreed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day, political leaders from across the spectrum, including stalwarts from the ruling PML-N, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962581/pml-n-stalwarts-back-call-for-political-dialogue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;called for dialogue and restraint&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the PTI later said that it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963000/?utm_source=newskit_ai&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;not engage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in negotiations with the federal government, with the party’s Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram saying the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964485&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that “confidence-building measures” between five major players in the country would improve the overall political situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#bangladesh-visit&quot; id=&quot;bangladesh-visit&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bangladesh visit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker also recalled his recent visit to Bangladesh for the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt; funeral &lt;/a&gt;of the former prime minister of the country, Khaleda Zia. Sadiq and India’s External Affairs Minister Subrah­manyam Jaishankar had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964410&quot;&gt;shaken hands&lt;/a&gt; during the visit, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Pakistani delegation received an unusually warm welcome from the people of Bangladesh,” Sadiq said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the Indian minister “came to greet him and shook his hand”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadiq recalled that he also met with the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, terming the meeting “pleasant”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the two “reached an agreement for the promotion of parliamentary and public relations” between the two countries during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further said that “he will always remember the love he received from the people of Bangladesh”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>NA speaker says opposition has not made formal contact for initiating talks</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965254/na-speaker-says-opposition-has-not-made-formal-contact-for-initiating-talks</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said on Monday that the opposition had not yet made formal contact for initiating talks with the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the remarks while speaking to the media, according to a handout issued by the NA Secretariat. It quoted him as saying that the “opposition had not yet made any formal contact to initiate a dialogue”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My role in the talks is only that of a facilitator,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadiq further stated that the committee system in the lower house of Parliament was fully functional as per constitutional requirements, adding that he was “completely independent” in his position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of the appointment of the NA opposition leader, Sadiq said that four letters had been sent to the opposition’s chief whip in this regard. He said that after the fourth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964060&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;, the opposition had submitted a certified copy of their decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NAofPakistan/status/2008085665448419481&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader will be initiated in the next parliamentary session,” Sadiq said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the process will move forward “after checking and verification of the signatures of the opposition members”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reiterated his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962792&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;offer for talks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, at a recent national conference organised by the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) opposition alliance, participants had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962585/door-to-talks-must-never-be-shut-ttap&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;agreed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day, political leaders from across the spectrum, including stalwarts from the ruling PML-N, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962581/pml-n-stalwarts-back-call-for-political-dialogue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;called for dialogue and restraint&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the PTI later said that it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963000/?utm_source=newskit_ai&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;not engage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in negotiations with the federal government, with the party’s Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram saying the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964485&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that “confidence-building measures” between five major players in the country would improve the overall political situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker also recalled his recent visit to Bangladesh for the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt; funeral &lt;/a&gt;of the former prime minister of the country, Khaleda Zia. Sadiq and India’s External Affairs Minister Subrah­manyam Jaishankar had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964410&quot;&gt;shaken hands&lt;/a&gt; during the visit, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Pakistani delegation received an unusually warm welcome from the people of Bangladesh,” Sadiq said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the Indian minister “came to greet him and shook his hand”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadiq recalled that he also met with the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, terming the meeting “pleasant”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the two “reached an agreement for the promotion of parliamentary and public relations” between the two countries during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further said that “he will always remember the love he received from the people of Bangladesh”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#pti-whip-meets-na-speaker-demands-achakzais-appointment&quot; id=&quot;pti-whip-meets-na-speaker-demands-achakzais-appointment&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;PTI whip meets NA speaker, demands Achakzai’s appointment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later in the day, the opposition’s chief whip in the NA, Amir Dogar, in a meeting with Sadiq, once again demanded the appointment of Mehmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also submitted documents regarding the withdrawal of cases against PTI leader Omar Ayub to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Ayub’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1928901&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;disqualification&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the seat of the opposition leader in the lower house has been vacant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a press statement issued by the NA Secretariat today, the two “exchanged views on matters related to the appointment of the opposition leader”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NAofPakistan/status/2008122399464821086&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, Dogar submitted documents regarding the withdrawal of cases against the disqualified opposition leader Ayub, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogar “once again” demanded that the Achakzai should be appointed as the opposition leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August last year, the incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1932053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;nominated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Achakzai for the post of opposition leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Dogar’s request, the NA speaker said that everything “will be done in accordance with the law and the constitution”, adding that he would apprise the House of the matter in the next session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that “a fresh process for the appointment of the opposition leader will be initiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadiq maintained that “the rules of the NA regarding the appointment of the opposition leader are clear”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh orders indefinite ban on IPL telecast after Mustafizur Rahman row</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965259/bangladesh-orders-indefinite-ban-on-ipl-telecast-after-mustafizur-rahman-row</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh government on Monday ordered an indefinite ban on the telecast and promotion of the Indian Premier League (IPL) following the controversy surrounding the removal of Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes after KKR said on Saturday they had released the Bangladesh bowler after being told to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh are scheduled to play three T20 World Cup matches in Kolkata next month, with the February 7-March 8 tournament being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said after an emergency meeting that it had “formally requested” the International Cricket Council (ICC)&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt; shift its team’s games to Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statement from the ministry of information and broadcasting said that it had “noted that no reason was communicated for the decision behind Mustafizur Rahman’s exclusion [from the IPL]” and that the development had “caused distress among the people of Bangladesh”, &lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this context, a decision has been taken regarding the broadcast of IPL matches,” the statement said, adding that the decision had been taken “in public interest”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was signed by the ministry’s assistant secretary Firoz Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no logical reason for this decision of the Indian Cricket Board and such a decision has distressed, shocked and angered the people of Bangladesh,” the government statement further said, according to &lt;em&gt;India Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A request has been made to stop the promotion/broadcast of all games and events of the Indian Premier League (IPL) until further orders,” the statement added. &lt;br /&gt;TV channels and streaming platforms have broadcast the IPL in Bangladesh since its inception in 2008, according to &lt;em&gt;ESPN Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the first time that the Bangladesh government has banned the telecast of an international cricket tournament, anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCB President Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters late on Saturday: “The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#worsened-relations-between-india-bangladesh&quot; id=&quot;worsened-relations-between-india-bangladesh&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worsened relations between India, Bangladesh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developments come against the backdrop of soured political relations between India and Bangladesh after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;toppled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1880793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;allowed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; India to play Champions Trophy matches in the United Arab Emirates due to sour relations with hosts Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will also play all their matches of the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, as part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, cricket news site &lt;em&gt;Cricbuzz&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/137127/bcb-to-approach-icc-on-t20-wc-security-after-mustafizurs-ipl-omission-cricbuzzcom&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the BCB would ask the BCCI for a formal explanation regarding Mustafizur’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; requests for comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Mustafizur Rahman was bought by KKR for Rs 9.20 crore at the auction last month, a move that underlined his value in T20 cricket.

      <title>Do Not Allow Politics To Colonise Our Shared Games</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/do-not-allow-politics-colonise-our-shared-games</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When cricket is weaponized against Bangladesh while India’s own internal challenges are ignored, the message is unmistakable: power, not principle, is guiding moral judgment. This undermines the very spirit of &lt;em&gt;Neighborhood First&lt;/em&gt;, which depends on trust and even‑handedness. Over time, such practices erode confidence, deepen asymmetry, and weaken the foundations of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh will not play T20 World Cup matches in India, decision taken in context of BCCI’s ‘extreme communal policy’</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will not play their T20 World Cup matches in India after its cricketer Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolkata Knight Riders said on Saturday they had released the Bangladesh bowler after being told to do so by India’s cricket board (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh are scheduled to play three T20 World Cup matches in Kolkata next month, with the February 7-March 8 tournament being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), after an emergency meeting on Sunday, said it had “formally requested” the International Cricket Council (ICC) shift its team’s games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Board of Directors resolved that the Bangladesh National Team will not travel to India for the tournament under the current conditions,” a BCB statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said its decision was made due to “growing concerns regarding the safety and security” of its players, and based on its government’s advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In light of this decision, the BCB has formally requested the International Cricket Council (ICC), as the event authority, to consider relocating all of Bangladesh’s matches to a venue outside India.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the BCB’s emergency meeting, Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul said, “We welcome this decision taken in the context of the extreme communal policy of India’s cricket board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Nazrul had &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bssnews.net/news/347627&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “We will not accept any insult to Bangladeshi cricket, cricketers and Bangladesh under any circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The days of slavery are over,” he had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he had ordered the BCB to inform the ICC that “where a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India despite being contracted, the entire Bangladeshi cricket team cannot feel safe going to play in the World Cup”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he would also ask that the IPL be blocked from Bangladeshi broadcasters. “I have requested the information and broadcasting adviser to stop the broadcasting of the IPL tournament in Bangladesh,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolkata Knight Riders, majority-owned by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, subsequently said that Mustafizur’s “release has been carried out following due process and consultations”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCB President Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters late on Saturday: “The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developments come against the backdrop of soured political relations between India and Bangladesh after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;toppled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1880793&quot;&gt;allowed&lt;/a&gt; India to play Champions Trophy matches in the United Arab Emirates due to sour relations with hosts Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will also play all their matches of the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, as part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, cricket news site &lt;em&gt;Cricbuzz&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/137127/bcb-to-approach-icc-on-t20-wc-security-after-mustafizurs-ipl-omission-cricbuzzcom&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the BCB would ask the BCCI for a formal explanation regarding Mustafizur’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will not play their Twenty20 World Cup matches in India after Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League team amid growing tensions between the countries, Bangladesh’s sports adviser Asif Nazrul said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolkata Knight Riders said on Saturday they had released the Bangladesh bowler after being told to do so by India’s cricket board (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh are scheduled to play three Twenty20 World Cup matches in Kolkata next month, with the February 7-March 8 tournament being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh will not go to India to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has taken this decision today,” Nazrul, who is an adviser to the Ministry of Sports, said in a statement after an emergency meeting of the BCB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We welcome this decision taken in the context of the extreme communal policy of India’s cricket board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Nazrul had &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bssnews.net/news/347627&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said,&lt;/a&gt; “We will not accept any insult to Bangladeshi cricket, cricketers and Bangladesh under any circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The days of slavery are over,” he had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he had ordered the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to write to the International Cricket Council (ICC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board should inform that, where a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India despite being contracted, the entire Bangladeshi cricket team cannot feel safe going to play in the World Cup,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have also instructed the board to request that Bangladesh’s World Cup matches should be held in Sri Lanka.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he would also ask that the IPL be blocked from Bangladeshi broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have requested the Information and Broadcasting Adviser to stop the broadcasting of the IPL tournament in Bangladesh,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolkata, majority-owned by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, subsequently said that Mustafizur’s “release has been carried out following due process and consultations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCB president Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters late on Saturday: “The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developments come against the backdrop of soured political relations between India and Bangladesh after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;toppled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the ICC allowed India to play Champions Trophy matches in the United Arab Emirates due to soured relations with hosts Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will also play all their matches of the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, as part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, cricket news site &lt;em&gt;Cricbuzz&lt;/em&gt; reported that the BCB would ask the BCCI for a formal explanation regarding Mustafizur’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC and BCB did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SMOKERS’ CORNER: THE MOB AND THE STATE</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964932/smokers-corner-the-mob-and-the-state</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On December 18, 2025, a 25-year-old Hindu garment worker was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962420/massive-crowd-attends-funeral-of-bangladesh-student-leader#:~:text=the%20violence%20this%20week%20also%20saw%20a%20Hindu%20garment%20worker%20killed%20following%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy&quot;&gt;lynched&lt;/a&gt; by a mob of approximately 150 people in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district. Following accusations of blasphemy, the victim was beaten to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mob lynchings in Bangladesh, known locally as &lt;em&gt;gono-pituni&lt;/em&gt;, have a long history. But this crisis is not unique to Bangladesh. According to the Human Rights Watch’s &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Report 2025&lt;/a&gt;, South Asia has emerged as a global epicentre for collective vigilantism, with similar violence frequently reported in India and Pakistan as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent surge in mob violence across India, Bangladesh and Pakistan is propelled by similar drivers: a decaying public confidence in the judiciary and the rapid spread of digital disinformation. This combination allows ‘street justice’ to effectively supersede state authority. As American political scientist Paul Staniland observed in a 2020 analysis for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, these patterns in South Asia are not recent developments. They are historical continuities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooted in colonial-era structures and galvanised by the 1947 partition of India, this culture of vigilantism has simply been recalibrated for the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Bangladesh to India and Pakistan, lynchings have become a grim substitute for justice, but South Asia’s mobs are not simply spontaneous eruptions of rage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1326729&quot;&gt;lynching&lt;/a&gt; of university student Mashal Khan in Mardan, Pakistan, serves as a grim illustration of how false allegations (circulated on social media) are weaponised to orchestrate violence. Targeted by a campus mob under the guise of blasphemy, Mashal was brutally murdered, and his death was filmed by mobile phones and then uploaded on social media sites. The plan of the attack was hatched by university staff and Mashal’s political rivals who wanted to silence his criticism of administrative corruption in the university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tragedy highlights a broader historical pattern in South Asia, where the mob has evolved into a calculated tool for political mobilisation and social policing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last century, the psychological mechanisms of ‘mob mentality’ have become deeply integrated into the region’s sociopolitical terrain. Mob mentality is driven by a psychological phenomenon known as ‘deindividuation’, where individuals lose their ‘sense of self’ and personal identity within a large group. When a person becomes part of an energised crowd, they often experience a feeling of anonymity. They believe they are indistinguishable from those around them and feel shielded from personal recognition or judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the individual perceives their actions as being shared by the collective, the weight of personal accountability is diminished. Deindividuation often overrides a person’s moral compass, pushing individuals to engage in behaviours they are likely to find unthinkable if they were acting alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that individuals in ‘collectivist societies’, where group harmony is prioritised over individual identity, may be more susceptible to participate in or cheer mob violence. According to a 2023 study by Chinese researchers Jingjing Jio and Jun Zhao, people in collectivist cultures are conditioned from birth to subordinate their personal identity to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the transition from being an individual actor to becoming part of a collective mass is fluid, allowing personal moral standards to be easily overwhelmed by a crowd’s passions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about China? It is a collectivist society, like most South Asian cultures. But mob violence in China is rare. While China saw significant mob activity in the 1960s and 1970s, the Chinese state (especially after 1989) has maintained a strict monopoly on force through its policy of ‘&lt;em&gt;weiwen&lt;/em&gt; [stability maintenance].’ Unauthorised gatherings, even if they are pro-government, are swiftly dismantled. All forms of mob action are perceived as a threat to the state’s authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divergence between South Asia and China regarding mob violence lies in the nature of the ‘moral trigger.’ In South Asia, religious anxieties, such as allegations of blasphemy (Pakistan, Bangladesh) or disputes over cow slaughter (India), serve as ‘sacred’ justifications that allow a crowd to emotionally and morally bypass legal frameworks. In contrast, China’s secular and strictly regulated environment lacks these sacred pretexts, making it far more difficult to ignite the emotional frenzy required for a lynching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/695984db0630f.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital dynamics further separate these two regions. South Asia grapples with viral, unregulated disinformation that facilitates rapid mobilisation, whereas China’s heavily monitored digital space prevents the formation of frenzied mobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within China’s one-party system, capitalist growth has birthed a lifestyle individualism which, while not political, acts as a buffer against the more destructive elements of rigid groupthink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But capitalism in South Asia has not catalysed a similar shift toward individualism. Instead, economic power remains deeply intertwined with collectivist traditions. For example, business communities and traders often provide significant financial support to both mainstream and radical religious groups that are often at the forefront of fomenting mob violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a feedback loop, where economic success reinforces traditional group identities rather than diluting them, maintaining the collective as the primary unit of social and political life. The Indian historian Meera Nanda has brilliantly investigated this in her book The God Market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individualism functions as a psychological safeguard, anchoring the person to their internal moral convictions. By prioritising personal integrity over collective impulse, the individual becomes resilient to deindividuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While capitalism and individualism are historically symbiotic, this synergy faces resistance in South Asia, despite the expansion of capitalism in the region. Here, individualism is often stigmatised as a threat to communal harmony. Consequently, while Western discourse frames individuality/ self-reliance as a hallmark of ‘maturity’, South Asian cultural paradigms frequently interpret personal autonomy as a form of egoism or a betrayal of domestic duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, as capitalism expands across South Asia, the burgeoning middle class is cultivating what the Indian psychologist Jai B. P. Sinha terms “localised individualism”. This model does not abandon communal ties but strategically renegotiates them, to serve personal and economic advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this shift is unlikely to curb the region’s propensity for mob violence nor neutralise the moral triggers behind lynchings. Rather than dismantling the moral narratives that incite such behaviour, South Asian middle classes have co-opted these narratives through populist movements, to protect their own socio-economic and political standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution requires a two-pronged approach: the cultivation of a more robust individualism and a decisive shift in state policy. The government must treat all mob activity as a direct challenge to state sovereignty and respond with appropriate force. Furthermore, the state must actively deconstruct and reframe the moral rationales that serve as triggers for collective violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, these remedies are more feasible in Pakistan’s pragmatic-centrist hybrid regime than in its neighbouring states. In India, a populist Hindu-nationalist government often relies on these very triggers for political mobilisation, while Bangladesh remains in a state of flux, struggling to navigate the volatile transition from autocracy to democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘Days of slavery are over’: Bangladesh to demand its T20 World Cup matches be moved outside India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/days-of-slavery-are-over-bangladesh-to-demand-its-t20-world-cup-matches-be-moved-outside-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will request their matches at next month’s T20 World Cup be played in Sri Lanka, after India forced a Bangladeshi player to quit the Indian Premier League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will not accept any insult to Bangladeshi cricket, cricketers and Bangladesh under any circumstances,” said Asif Nazrul, Youth and Sports Adviser in the interim government, in a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bssnews.net/news/347627&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; carried by the state-run &lt;em&gt;BSS&lt;/em&gt; news agency Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The days of slavery are over,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman was on Saturday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; by the Kolkata Knight Riders after the Indian Premier League (IPL) team were “advised” by Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to do so, following tensions between the neighbouring nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he had ordered the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to write to the International Cricket Council (ICC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board should inform that, where a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India despite being contracted, the entire Bangladeshi cricket team cannot feel safe going to play in the World Cup,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have also instructed the board to request that Bangladesh’s World Cup matches should be held in Sri Lanka.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T20 World Cup begins on February 7, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh are scheduled to play their four group matches in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka, part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations between India and Bangladesh soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCB president Aminul Islam Bulbul said the board will hold an emergency meeting later on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind”, he told reporters late Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2026 IPL season begins on March 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he would also ask that the IPL be blocked from Bangladeshi broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have requested the Information and Broadcasting Adviser to stop the broadcasting of the IPL tournament in Bangladesh,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolkata, majority-owned by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, subsequently said that Mustafizur’s “release has been carried out following due process and consultations”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>BCCI instructs Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh’s Mustafizur after pressure from BJP</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indian Premier League (IPL) team Kolkata Knight Riders have been told to release fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia said on Saturday, amid growing tensions between the countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sangeet Som’s criticed Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise, calling Khan a traitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur’s selection to play for KKR had come amid allegations mostly by the Indian right-wing over attacks on Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, hundreds protested near Bangladesh’s High Commission in New Delhi after Hindu factory worker Dipu Chandra Das was beaten and set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district by a crowd that accused him of making derogatory remarks about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 12 people were arrested in connection with his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to recent developments going on all across, the BCCI has instructed the franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release one of their players, Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, from their squad,” Saikia &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://aninews.in/news/sports/cricket/kkr-confirms-exclusion-of-mustafizur-rahman-from-squad-after-bcci-directive20260103134705/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Indian news agency &lt;em&gt;ANI&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They can ask for a replacement if needed. And upon request, BCCI will allow a replacement player.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“BCCI will allow Kolkata Knight Riders a replacement player in line with IPL regulations, and further details will be communicated in due course,” the team added in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; has approached Mustafizur for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, 30, has played for Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals in previous seasons of the IPL, taking 65 wickets in 60 matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964862/shahrukh-khan-gets-flak-over-bangladesh-cricketer-in-kolkata-knight-riders&quot;&gt;signed by Kolkata&lt;/a&gt; in last month’s auction for a fee of 92 million Indian rupees ($1.02 million), making him the most expensive player from Bangladesh in IPL history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt;, opposition Congress party on Thursday condemned Som’s criticism of Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While calling Khan a “gaddar” (traitor), former Uttar Pradesh MLA Som questioned him for investing money in a player “from a country working against India”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt; quoted from a video clip of him as saying: “The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite all this, traitors like Shahrukh Khan, I’m calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shahrukh that they will not succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident worsened relations between India and its neighbour, with ties already strained after Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;fled to New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1847298&quot;&gt;protests against her&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 19th edition of the IPL begins on March 26, after India and Sri Lanka co-host the Twenty20 World Cup starting in February.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shahrukh Khan gets flak over Bangladesh cricketer in Kolkata Knight Riders</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964862/shahrukh-khan-gets-flak-over-bangladesh-cricketer-in-kolkata-knight-riders</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI: Political tensions between India and Bangladesh spilled into the cricket field after Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan recently inducted Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman into his Indian Premier League (IPL) team Kolkata Knight Riders and a Hindutva politician called him a traitor, reports said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt;, opposition Congress party on Thursday condemned Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sangeet Som’s criticism of Shahrukh for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Uttar Pradesh MLA, Som targeted Shahrukh and called him a “gaddar” (traitor) for backing the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not unusual for the popular actor, who happens to be a Muslim. In fact, the Muslim movie star triumvirate of Sharukh, Salman Khan and Amir Khan have all faced allegations that they were anti-Hindu, pro-Pakistan or whatever else BJP supporters choose to call them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the late acting legend Dilip Kumar was also not spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mustafizur controversy erupted following the IPL 2026 auction, where KKR secured “The Fizz” for a staggering Rs92 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the move was seen as a tactical masterstroke by cricket analysts, it also waded into a nationalistic backlash underway amid diplomatic tensions between India and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy over Mustafizur being in Shahrukh’s team is nicely timed with domestic election season in West Bengal where the BJP is threatening to topple secular Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in polls due by mid-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur’s selection to play for KKR has come amid allegations mostly by the Indian right-wing over attacks on Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While calling Shahrukh a traitor, Som questioned him for investing money in a player “from a country working against India”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt; quoted from a video clip of him as saying: “The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite all this, traitors like Shahrukh Khan, I’m calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shahrukh that they will not succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress MP Manickam Tagore, strongly condemning the ‘traitor’ remarks, called the comments an “attack on India’s pluralism” while saying that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) should stop “poisoning society”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Som was adamant. “Rahman won’t be able to step outside the airport,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>South Asia&amp;#039;s Youth Bulge Risks Becoming Long-Term Liability</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/south-asias-youth-bulge-risks-becoming-long-term-liability</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;South Asia’s unemployment challenge is unfolding differently across different regional countries, yet driven by almost similar structural failures. India’s scale magnifies the risks of jobless growth; Pakistan’s instability deepens youth disillusionment; Sri Lanka’s educated unemployment reflects long-standing policy neglect; and Bangladesh’s export-led success masks limited employment diversification. Unless these states move beyond fragmented schemes and adopt employment-centred growth, skill-linked education, and gender-inclusive labour reforms, the region’s youthful population will shift from being a potential dividend to a shared strategic vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Kolkata Knight Riders&apos; signing of Bangladeshi bowler Mustafizur Rahman for the 2026 IPL has sparked a political firestorm. BJP leaders and religious groups are protesting, citing strained India-Bangladesh ties and alleged violence against minorities. Concerns were voiced that such sporting ties could be exploited, leading to threats against players and the franchise owner if matches are held in Kolkata.</description>

      <title>Ex-information secretary Ambreen Jan selected to head Pemra</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964676/ex-information-secretary-ambreen-jan-selected-to-head-pemra</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ambreen Jan, former information secretary, was selected on Friday as the new chairperson of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra), which will make her the first female head of the electronic media regulator once her appointment is confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous head of the regulator, Mohammad Saleem Baig, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1410839&quot;&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 and retired last year, leaving the post vacant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meeting of a parliamentary committee, chaired by Shehbaz Babar, selected Jan after it was convened to appoint the next head of the influential media regulatory authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the committee’s unanimous approval, Jan’s name was forwarded to President Asif Ali Zardari for final confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Grade 22 officer, Jan has also previously served as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1882974/?utm_source=newskit_ai&quot;&gt;managing director&lt;/a&gt; of the state broadcaster &lt;em&gt;PTV,&lt;/em&gt; the director general of &lt;em&gt;Radio Pakistan&lt;/em&gt; and press counsellor to Bangladesh while relations were strained from 2011 to 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was among five shortlisted candidates considered for the post, including Brigadier (retd.) Anwar Ahmed, Mateen Haider, Irfan Ashraf, and Dr Hamid Khan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>India to tour Bangladesh for white-ball matches in September</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964679/india-to-tour-bangladesh-for-white-ball-matches-in-september</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;India’s postponed six-match white-ball cricket tour of Bangladesh will take place in September, Bangladesh’s Cricket Board said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series, including three one-day and three T20 matches, originally due to be played in August 2025, was delayed after both countries’ boards “mutually agreed to defer” the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India will now play three ODIs and three T20s between September 1 to 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The postponement last year came as political relations between India and neighbouring Bangladesh turned frosty, after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina fled to India, where she has remained, straining relations between Dhaka and New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh has repeatedly requested Hasina’s extradition. She was sentenced to death in absentia in November for orchestrating a deadly crackdown on the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But New Delhi is also closely watching the upcoming elections on February 12, the first vote in the South Asian nation of 170 million people since the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar visited Bangladesh to attend the funeral of former leader Khaleda Zia, the most senior visit by an Indian official since the overthrow of Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is widely seen as a frontrunner in elections, and her son Tarique Rahman, who returned last month after 17 years in exile, is seen as a potential prime minister if it wins a majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will also host series against Pakistan, New Zealand, Australia and the West Indies, across all three formats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Spectrum-starved country’: IT minister says govt to auction 600 MHz spectrum next month</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964674/spectrum-starved-country-it-minister-says-govt-to-auction-600-mhz-spectrum-next-month</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Federal Minister for IT and Telecommunications Shaza Fatima Khawaja announced on Friday that Pakistan would auction the 600 megahertz (MHz) spectrum next month to provide better internet speeds and roll out 5G in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a meeting last week, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962943&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the process of auctioning the 600 MHz spectrum within two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The spectrum available for our telecom industry is extremely limited,” said the minister while addressing the media in Islamabad, and added that telcos “provide services in the country using just the 274 MHz”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a spectrum-starved country,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a country of 240 million people with only 274 MHz of spectrum,” she stated, adding that “Bangladesh, with about two-thirds of Pakistan’s population, provides 600 MHz.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spectrum is the range of radio frequencies that carries wireless signals for mobile phones, the internet, TV, and radio. Mobile networks like 3G, 4G, and 5G operate by sending data over specific frequency bands within this spectrum. In South Asia, Bangladesh, India, Bhutan, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka have launched 5G networks nationwide, while Pakistan, Nepal, and Afghanistan have yet to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal minister maintained that spectrum availability in Pakistan was the lowest in the region due to the absence of any major spectrum auction for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will not only improve our 3G and 4G services, but also introduce 5G in Pakistan for the first time,” she elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal minister emphasised that the internet was “critical infrastructure,” like roads used to be in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The internet plays a crucial role in the development of the social sector, large-scale economic policies, and national and personal security. Without this [600MHz] level of connectivity, we cannot move forward,” she maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT minister said that it is vital to perceive the internet and connectivity as an “enabling tool” that will unlock the country’s “ economic potential and create employment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, during a press conference alongside the finance minister, Khawaja said that the government was trying to ensure that the auction is completed by the end of January or early February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal minister said that in the auction, additional bands were being offered in Pakistan for the first time, which would not only improve 3G and 4G quality but also ensure the rollout of 5G services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stressed that the internet was integral to the government’s digitisation efforts as part of the Digital Nation Pakistan Act, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, the consultant for the 5G spectrum auction &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955349&quot;&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; its report to the government, which had remained stalled due to the merger of PTCL and Telenor and litigation over the 2600 MHz band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report, prepared by US-based consultancy firm National Economic Research Associates (NERA), noted that Pakistan was offering 606MHz of new spectrum across six major bands: 700MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz, 2600MHz and 3500MHz. The 2600MHz band was considered the most suitable for 5G.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>From the rift with the U.S. to a slow rapprochement with China, but reduced ties with Russia. From the new normal in conflict with Pakistan and spiralling ties with Bangladesh, to closer bonds with the Taliban in Afghanistan — 2025 was India’s most challenging year in foreign policy.

      <title>Just a handshake</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964530/just-a-handshake</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;IT was a handshake that sent a ripple through the region. On Wednesday, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964291&quot;&gt;shook hands in Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;, where they had both arrived to attend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964271&quot;&gt;state funeral of former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;passed away &lt;/a&gt;earlier this week. It was, doubtless, a significant moment which invited attention across three countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chief Adviser of the Government of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/ChiefAdviserGoB/status/2006340330585833665&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made note of it in a post on his X account&lt;/a&gt;, which stated that the two men had “exchanged greetings” during their interaction ahead of the funeral programme organised for Ms Zia. Pictures of the two, sombrely attired for the occasion, accompanied his post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian media downplayed the event, framing the handshake as a usual nicety at such events and therefore inconsequential. The Pakistani media, noting that it was the first high-level contact between the two nations since the May hostilities, ran with the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/NAofPakistan/status/2006331508479664546&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement issued by the National Assembly Secretariat&lt;/a&gt;, underlining the part where it claimed that the handshake and pleasantries had been initiated by Mr Jaishankar, who reportedly approached Mr Sadiq with an informal acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason for the interest could be that this is a slow time of the year for newsrooms. Another could be that anticipation has continuously been high for what happens next between Pakistan and India. Yet, given the prevailing atmosphere, not much can or should be read into a mere handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the NA Secretariat’s statement on the ‘handshake’ notes that Pakistan has “consistently emphasised dialogue, restraint and cooperative measures, including proposals for peace talks and joint investigations into the alleged false flag Pahalgam incident, in order to prevent unprovoked aggression and escalation”. Can this be read as a signal to New Delhi that the door to talks remains open?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the hostile rhetoric and posturing from next door show no signs of relenting. Recent reports regarding plans for controversial hydropower projects by India, which would violate the Indus Waters Treaty, are designed to be provocations for further tensions between the two states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, without question, a strong need for temperatures to be brought down. But handshakes and exchanging pleasantries alone will not make that happen. It will require earnest effort, especially on New Delhi’s part, and diplomacy at the highest levels before a thaw can be expected.&lt;/p&gt;
