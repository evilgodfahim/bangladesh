      <title>In pictures: Millions vote in Bangladesh’s landmark elections</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972701/in-pictures-millions-vote-in-bangladeshs-landmark-elections</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshis head to the polls on Thursday, with nearly 128 million people eligible to vote, in a key test of the country’s return to democracy after a popular uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;long-time leader Sheikh Hasina in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A recent opinion poll by the Dhaka-based Communication Research Foundation and Bangladesh Elections and Public Opinion Studies found corruption to be voters’ top concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh has long ranked among the world’s worst performers in Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the frontrunning Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its main rival Jamaat-e-Islami, have made tackling graft central to their campaigns, with Jamaat’s anti-corruption image helping fuel its resurgence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh votes in landmark election after Gen Z revolution</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/bangladesh-votes-in-landmark-election-after-gen-z-revolution</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshis lined up outside polling booths on Thursday as voting began for what many say is a pivotal election for the South Asian nation, marking a return to democracy after the 2024 ouster of long-time premier Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-driven uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts say a decisive result is crucial for steady governance in the nation of 175 million, as the deadly anti-Hasina protests triggered months of unrest and disrupted key industries, including the garments sector, the worlds second-largest exporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contest pits two coalitions led by former allies, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-e-Islami, with opinion polls giving an edge to the BNP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina’s Awami League is banned, and she remains in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, opening the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh as Dhaka’s ties with New Delhi deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous elections marred by opposition boycotts and intimidation, more than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, are vying for 300 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voting in one constituency has been postponed due to the death of a candidate. At least 50 parties are contesting in total, a national record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This election is not just another routine vote, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, head of an interim government installed after Hasinas ouster, said this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public awakening we witnessed against long-standing anger, inequality, deprivation and injustice finds its constitutional expression in this election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel, there will be a referendum on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and imposing a two-term limit on the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the crowded field and expectations of a close race, the campaign period remained largely peaceful, barring a few incidents.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crucial test for Bangladesh now will be to ensure the election is conducted fairly and impartially, and for all parties to then accept the result, said Thomas Kean, a senior consultant with the International Crisis Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that happens, it will be the strongest evidence yet that Bangladesh has indeed embarked on a period of democratic renewal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On election day, more than 100,000 soldiers from the army, navy and air force will assist nearly 200,000 police in maintaining law and order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Polling opened at 7:30am (0230 GMT) and closes at 4:30pm. Counting will begin soon after, with early trends expected around midnight and results likely to be clear by Friday morning, Election Commission officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 128 million people are registered to vote, 49% of them women. But only 83 female candidates are contesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Corruption and inflation are the biggest issues among voters, a recent survey found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two prime ministerial candidates are the BNP’s Tarique Rahman and Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman. They are not related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several voters are conflicted about participating in the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some are determined to cast their ballots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. “Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#president-zardari-hopes-for-peaceful-process&quot; id=&quot;president-zardari-hopes-for-peaceful-process&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;President Zardari hopes for peaceful process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COMMENT: After political win, Pakistan team must deliver against India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972637/comment-after-political-win-pakistan-team-must-deliver-against-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;NOTHING is certain in life, wrote Benjamin Franklin, except death and taxes. He was wrong. There is one other certainty in life, and that is a Pakistan-India match at an ICC tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This truism was close to being debunked this year, but the bountiful stars aligned to deliver us a contest that is — to borrow a phrase from a leading Chinese car-maker — beyond your dreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, the match is bigger than ever and a focal point of international attention. Pakistan is resurgent on the field; the progression in performance is clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has created a mini-political earthquake off the back of the ‘un-boycott’, as it were. The question is whether Pakistan can back up its political game on the cricket field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country must set out a longer-term strategy that can maximise commercial value of its 200 million population, and turn its erratic team into one of the world’s strongest&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ‘un-boycott’ gave each interested party something to walk away with. Bangladesh will not be punished; on the contrary, it is being rewarded with an ICC tournament of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has secured its cricketing border with Pakistan and satisfied its bankers. Pakistan stood up for Bangladesh, avoided harming its enduring ally Sri Lanka, and extracted some positive rhetoric from the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some argue that the boycott was never a serious one; just a piece of elaborate theatre. Others insist that the PCB has exposed what is rotten in the state of international cricket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India may think itself an emperor of cricket, believe others, but it is now ruler without a Lunghi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#indias-questionable-leadership&quot; id=&quot;indias-questionable-leadership&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;India’s ‘questionable leadership’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the euphoria, it also important to examine Pakistan’s concrete gains from the boycott threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reality is that India always held the whip hand, being the most financially powerful cricket board in the world. That power allows it to control international cricket through the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world’s other so-called leading cricket nations, notably England and Australia, all bend the knee to India. Money talks, cricket walks, and integrity is benched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan took the Bangladesh opportunity to draw attention to India’s malign rule of international cricket. Its options were few and it had little support; only holding the trump cards of either withdrawing from the tournament, or refusing to play against India in the $200m contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan spoke openly about India’s unjust domination of international cricket — a reality that everybody knows, but nobody dares to speak up about. Perhaps triggering the conversation is an achievement in itself, but in concrete terms, Pakistan hasn’t gained much here, although it may stand to reap benefits later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking more positively, talks are now promised about fairer distribution of tournament revenue among states. Those talks might also deliver some future concessions — albeit unspecified — in Pakistan’s favour. That would be a good outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another talking point is the restoration of bilateral series between Pakistan and India. This would be a veritable win and India has no credible argument to oppose it, other than its domestic populist politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is clearly in the wrong, and the outcome of those deliberations will deliver a definitive verdict on the credibility of India’s leadership of this international sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#what-pakistan-must-do-next&quot; id=&quot;what-pakistan-must-do-next&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Pakistan must do next&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan may have not won this battle outright, but it might yet make advances in the war. However, the country has now restored its financial prospects by fulfilling its commitments in relation to the ICC tournament. It also pays due reverence to co-host Sri Lanka, who have unfailingly stood by Pakistan’s side through decades of struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we also come away confirming is that the strategy for Pakistan, if it seeks real change, remains two-pronged. You can only hold sway in the world of cricket if you sit on a lucrative commercial market, or if your team is one of the most powerful – ideally both. That is the strategy the PCB must pursue, but is one that was never seriously adopted before, because of politics and short-termism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two ways this scenario ends up well for Pakistan. First, if the ICC does make changes and offers concessions after the tournament — this is, admittedly, a long shot. Negotiations will need to take place, and perhaps by maintaining a firm position against India’s twisted rule of international cricket, momentum and support for genuine change will grow among other nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Pakistan must grit its teeth and do some hard thinking to set out a longer-term strategy that will lead to maximising the commercial value of its 200 million population, and at the same time turn its erratic, and sometimes disappointing, team into one of the world’s strongest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There must be no compromise on either of these strategic agendas — and Pakistan can begin this new era by defeating India in Sri Lanka on Feb 15. Pakistan needs a big performance to back up its big rhetoric. This is the time; this is the hour — and a victory against India would certainly be an outcome beyond the recent dreams of Pakistan’s supporters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh heads to pivotal election amid economic strain</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972598/bangladesh-heads-to-pivotal-election-amid-economic-strain</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Jobs, governance and the freedom to speak without fear top the priorities of Bangladesh’s Gen Z voters as the South Asian country heads into a national election called after a student-led uprising in 2024&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt; toppled&lt;/a&gt; longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thursday’s vote is considered the Muslim-majority nation’s first competitive election since 2009, even though Hasina’s Awami League party has been barred from contesting as the Election Commission has suspended its registration.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decisive result is critical for restoring stability in the nation of 175 million after months of unrest that has disrupted major industries, including the garments sector in the worlds second-largest exporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 28pc of Bangladesh’s population is between the ages of 15-29, or from Gen Z, according to government estimates from 2022. After taking a leading role in Hasina’s 2024 ouster, these youngsters are expected to come out in large numbers to vote, and their choices could be crucial in a close contest. But there has been no major reform in the interim, and no viable alternative party has emerged, according to many, leaving the battle for government mostly between frontrunners Bang­ladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Islamist Jamaat-e-Isl­a­mi, both established parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen Z voters hope for job creation and improvement in governance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This election comes from the July (2024) movement,” said Farhan Sadik, 20. “If candidates think they can do politics the old way, that wont work.” A youth-driven party born out of the country’s 2024 uprising has joined Jamaat in a coalition; however most analysts expect BNP to win. Shakil Ahmed, a government and politics professor at Jahangirnagar University, said young voters were “looking for a new political class to take charge”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Since the newly formed party has not provided a broad-based political platform, the BNP is expected to be their preferred choice.” Asif Shahan, a professor at the University of Dhaka, however said Gen Z voters were likely to back Jamaat. “It may not be decisive, but it will certainly give Jamaat a significant boost, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Law and order&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gen Z voters said their main issues were job opportunities and political freedom. “I expect the new government to understand young job seekers like me,” said Monika Akter, 24, from Bogura district who will vote for the first time. “We need a fair and transparent recruitment and exam process. Especially National University graduates — we suffer the most.” Mohammed Muniruzzaman, 21, added: “About 86pc of National University students are unemployed — that’s really painful. We don’t want to finish our studies and remain jobless. We need IT-based education so we can compete globally.” National University is a public institution that runs over 2,200 colleges across Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom of expression — which critics say was sharply curtailed under Hasina — is another defining issue. “We couldn’t speak freely during the fascist period,” said journalist Mohammed Saimum Jahan, 22. “Whoever comes to power, we need freedom of speech even to criticise the government.” In rural areas, Gen Z voters were focused more on bread and butter issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We spend a lot on seeds and fertiliser, but when we sell vegetables, we don’t get a fair rate,” said Farhana Akhter, 21, from a farming family in Bogura. “We don’t expect miracles in one day, but we hope things improve step by step.” Some young voters said they were turning toward parties they believe can deliver locally, rather than the BNP or Jamaat.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first-ever player auction for the 11th edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) was held in Lahore on Wednesday, with fast bowler Naseem Shah sold to Rawalpindi for Rs86.5 million — the highest bid of the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction ended after several unsold players were snapped up by the eight franchises. Earlier rounds of bidding saw major players auctioned off, including Fakhar Zaman, David Warner and Muhammad Amir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967839&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The auction began with bidding on all-rounders, starting with Faheem Ashraf at the base price of Rs42m, with Islamabad United putting in the final bid at Rs85m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team also scored New Zealand cricketer Mark Chapman after they bid Rs70m against Peshawar Zalmi’s Rs68.5m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team secured Mir Hamza Sajjad as well at a winning bid of Rs7m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islamabad United and Karachi Kings went neck and neck bidding for Pakistan team captain Salman Ali Agha. However, with the final bid of Rs58.5m, Karachi Kings secured the player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australian cricketer Adam Zampa is also set to join the team after the Karachi Kings secured him with a bid of Rs45m.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the 90-minute recess, Australia’s Usman Khawaja and New Zealand’s Jimmy Neesham and Bangladesh legend Shakib Al Hasan were among the players still unsold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the ceremony, PSL Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Salman Naseer addressed the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the HBL PSL X ended, and the euphoria died down a little, and we looked ahead at the path in front of us, all commercial contracts had come to an end…monumental challenges lay ahead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PSL and PCB teams have burned midnight oil day in and day out to get us where we are today,” Naseer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCB, in a statement issued today, said that over 800 players have registered for the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the cricket board shared the base prices for players, with the top bracket set at Rs42 million (platinum), followed by Rs22m (diamond), Rs11m (gold), and Rs6m (silver and emerging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1.5m for bid amounts above Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above-mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad will have a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”, while the number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Explainer: Why the world is watching Bangladesh’s 2026 election and referendum</title>

      <description>Bangladesh heads to the polls on February 12, 2026, in its first national election since Sheikh Hasina’s 2024 ouster, marking the end of an 18‑month transition under Muhammad Yunus.  

Nearly 127 million voters will choose a new government and decide on the July Charter, a sweeping set of constitutional reforms.  With the Awami League banned, the contest is led by the BNP and a Jamaat‑NCP bloc, in an election that could redefine Bangladesh’s political future.</description>

      <title>Why playing India is the smartest decision PCB has made in months</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972538/why-playing-india-is-the-smartest-decision-pcb-has-made-in-months</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In international cricket, principle is often loud, emotional and instantly gratifying. Strategy, on the other hand, is quieter, slower, and frequently misunderstood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;eventually agree to play India &lt;/a&gt;on February 15 falls squarely in the latter category, and despite the initial optics, it is the right call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dramatic boycott call did what it needed to do early on. It created noise, unsettled the International Cricket Council (ICC), and earned Pakistan something it has been desperately short of in recent years: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970749&quot;&gt;an ally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s open friction with the ICC and India over security, scheduling and governance issues suddenly aligned its interests with Pakistan’s.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials taking place in Lahore on Feb 8, 2026. &amp;mdash; Screengrab via PCB video&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/1116263346e940a.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) officials taking place in Lahore on Feb 8, 2026. — Screengrab via PCB video&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alignment may be situational for now, but in a cricketing ecosystem where Pakistan often finds itself isolated, even a temporary ally matters. In what seemed like an emotional and loud drama initially, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has done something that suggests calculation rather than impulse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country’s stance carried weight morally as it played its strongest card not for immediate self-benefit, but in visible solidarity with another board, one with far less financial leverage and political capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The episode also forced a conversation about power imbalance in world cricket and structural marginalisation of smaller boards.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;The uncomfortable truth of the India-Pakistan clash is that it is not merely a cricket match. It is a financial event, the economic engine that quietly funds the ICC&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/11163031a88a82b.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;standing with Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan positioned itself not as a lone dissenter, but as part of a broader discomfort within the “middle tier” of cricket nations. However, the PCB has bills to pay, and such symbolic gestures, regardless of their strength, are not going to balance the books, which is why deciding to play the India game is a strategic win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By taking the field on Sunday, Pakistan will avoid the twin disasters a boycott would have triggered: forfeiture of crucial match points and loss of ICC revenue. The former would not have hurt Pakistan competitively as much, given their record against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the 16 times the two arch-rivals have faced each other in the shortest format, Pakistan have only won three, while India dominates with 13 victories. Instead, it was the huge potential loss of money that got the governing body quiver at Pakistan’s boycott call.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The uncomfortable truth of the India-Pakistan clash is that it is not merely a cricket match. It is a financial event, the economic engine that quietly funds the ICC’s ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India receives 38.5 per cent of the ICC’s revenue distribution in the current cycle, which is more than what the next six boards receive combined. Pakistan’s share hovers around five to six per cent. This disparity is not an accident; it reflects market gravity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian broadcast market alone drives the bulk of ICC media rights, a deal worth billions over a four-year cycle, which is the major source of revenue for the governing body.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan celebrates after the dismissal of Netherlands&amp;rsquo; Max O&amp;rsquo;Dowd during the 2026 ICC Men&amp;rsquo;s T20 Cricket World Cup group stage match between Pakistan and the Netherlands at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo on February 7. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/11162547c3c830c.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan celebrates after the dismissal of Netherlands’ Max O’Dowd during the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 Cricket World Cup group stage match between Pakistan and the Netherlands at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground in Colombo on February 7. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite receiving the lion’s share, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)’s income doesn’t depend on the ICC, as its revenue is heavily dominated by the Indian Premier League (IPL) and bilateral series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, any financial loss to the ICC would not have impacted BCCI as strongly as it would have Pakistan and other cricket boards, whose incomes are heavily dependent on their ICC revenue share.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reason India-Pakistan contests are manufactured into every ICC tournament. They are the biggest television events in cricket, reportedly accounting for 20-30pc of a tournament’s total broadcast value in a single match. The marquee encounter does not fund India’s cricket at a large scale, but it subsidises the ecosystem in which Pakistan cricket survives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To risk that revenue for a dispute that was not even Pakistan’s own would have been strategically naive. Agreeing to play India also repairs and strengthens the PCB’s working relationship with other boards, particularly Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates (UAE), who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/in-phone-call-with-pm-sri-lanka-president-urges-pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-clash-against-india&quot;&gt;strongly requested&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to call off its boycott.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are boards that Pakistan has often relied on for neutral venues, logistical cooperation and political support within ICC committees. A unilateral boycott would have made Pakistan appear rigid, pushing it further to the margins at a time when it needs quiet diplomacy, not loud isolation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lately, even the ICC has been accommodating towards the PCB, bending significantly by agreeing to a hybrid hosting model to ensure that Pakistan does not have to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pushing the governing body further, especially when Pakistan lacks the financial muscle to challenge it head-on, would have been a dangerous escalation. The larger context is bleak, as the ICC is effectively run by India. This is not a conspiracy, but an economic reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s billion-plus market dictates broadcast value, sponsorship interest and administrative power. Complaining about reality without a long-term counter strategy is futile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While boycotts feel defiant, the harsh reality is that they change nothing. Pakistan currently does not possess the commercial influence or on-field dominance required to force systemic change. That does not mean it should abandon principle altogether, but it must choose its battles wisely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By taking a firm stance and then agreeing to play, the PCB has extracted narrative value without incurring material loss. It has shown that it can push back, but also that it understands its limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a sport that is increasingly governed by realpolitik, that balance matters.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first-ever player auction for the 11th edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) is underway in Lahore, with fast bowler Naseem Shah sold to Rawalpindi for Rs86.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight franchises have started bidding on spinners, following the conclusion of the previous round, which saw wicket-keepers being auctioned off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967839&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi spinner Rishaad Hossain was sold to Rawalpindi for a bid of Rs30m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up were Mamoon Imtiaz, Ali Majid, Momin Qamar, Peter Hatzoglou, and Arif Yaqoob, who did not receive any bids. Faisal Akram was sold off to Quetta Gladiators for the final bid of Rs12.5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#sahibaza-farhan-sold-off-to-sialkot-stallionz&quot; id=&quot;sahibaza-farhan-sold-off-to-sialkot-stallionz&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Sahibaza Farhan sold off to Sialkot Stallionz&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bidding on wicket keepers began with Azam Khan — at the base price of Rs11m. With the final bids of Rs31.5m by Sialkot Stallionz and Rs32.5m by Karachi Kings, the latter managed to secure Khan.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Sialkot Stallionz bagged Sahibzada Farhan against Karachi Kings, with a bid of Rs57m.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up were Sri Lankan cricketer Dinesh Chandimal and West Indies’ Johnson Charles, both of whom went unsold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#team-rawalpindi-bags-naseem-shah-haris-rauf-with-lahore-qalandars&quot; id=&quot;team-rawalpindi-bags-naseem-shah-haris-rauf-with-lahore-qalandars&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Team Rawalpindi bags Naseem Shah; Haris Rauf with Lahore Qalandars&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the bidding for fast bowlers, Muhammad Ali was sold off to Hyderabad Houstan Kingsmen in a last-minute bid of Rs21.5m against Rawalpindi’s Rs20.5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was Chris Jordan, who went unsold after receiving zero bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lahore Qalandars regained fast-bowler Haris Rauf at Rs76m against the Rawalpindi team’s Rs74.5m bid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Hasnain, at the base price of  received no bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karachi Kings put in the first bid for Naseem Shah at Rs65m, followed by Islamabad United bidding Rs66.5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a series of back-and-forth bids between the two, Rawalpindi came in at a bid of Rs86.5m, following which Karachi Kings bowed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second round began with Barbadian cricketer Kyle Mayers at the base price of Rs11m, who went unsold after no bids were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand’s Colin Munroe went unsold as well. Karachi Kings bagged Australian batsman David Warner at Rs79m after a round of back-and-forth bidding with Peshawar Zalmi.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South African batsman Rilee Rossouw was sold off to Quetta Gladiators for Rs55m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#islamabad-united-bags-all-rounder-faheem-ashraf&quot; id=&quot;islamabad-united-bags-all-rounder-faheem-ashraf&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islamabad United bags all-rounder Faheem Ashraf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction began with bidding on all-rounders, starting with Faheem Ashraf at the base price of Rs42m, with Islamabad United putting in the final bid at Rs85m.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/thePSLt20/status/2021486822120096211&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second all-rounder to be auctioned was Imaad Wasim at Rs42m, followed by Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz at the base price of Rs11m; however, no bids were made by any of the teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-rounders Hussain Talat, Asif Afridi, Danish Aziz, and Muhammad Zeeshan at the base price of Rs11m received no bids as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the ceremony, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) PSL Salman Naseer addressed the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the HBL PSL X ended, and the euphoria died down a little, and we looked ahead at the path in front of us, all commercial contracts had come to an end…monumental challenges lay ahead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PSL and PCB team have burnt out midnight oil day in and day out to get us where we are today,” Naseer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB, in a statement issued today, said that over 800 players have registered for the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the cricket board shared the base prices for players, with the top bracket set at Rs42 million (platinum), followed by Rs22m (diamond), Rs11m (gold), and Rs6m (silver and emerging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1.5m for bid amounts above Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above-mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad will have a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”, while the number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Over half of polling centres are deemed risk-prone, prompting a massive deployment of nearly 9.58 lakh security personnel. For the first time, drones and body-worn cameras will monitor the process, aiming for a peaceful transition after the Hasina era.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh election: Disinformation swarms social media</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972525/bangladesh-election-disinformation-swarms-social-media</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The General Elections are set to take place in Bangladesh tomorrow (February 12), and the social media platform Facebook has become a battleground for disinformation in the country, with fabricated quotes, doctored images and misleading photocards circulating widely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False statements attributed to political leaders are seeking to provoke outrage, while unrelated images are being used to create the illusion of foreign backing or geopolitical tension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, AI‑generated visuals are being deployed to frame political figures in staged scenarios, including fabricated meetings and conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts have warned that these tactics may fuel partisan hostility and shape public opinion ahead of the February election, as many voters are exposed to fake news.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Din M Sumon Rahman, Head of Media Studies and Journalism at the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB), said, “The main intention behind a disinformation campaign is to manipulate voting choice. Disinformation neatly feeds the confirmation bias of a decided voter’s choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key target of disinformation are swing voters, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Voters who don’t know whom to vote for, don’t have a strong opinion, are provided with disinformation that influences them to vote for a certain political party. In this process, they use religion, violence and many other aspects for provocation,” added Sumon, also founding editor of fact-checking organisation FactWatch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one-month from mid-December 2025 to mid-January 2026, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; documented 220 cases of disinformation circulated by various party-aligned actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entities that appear to support Jamaat-i-Islami top the list, with half of the documented instances of disinformation (96) coming from them within this limited dataset. The Awami League-aligned groups follow with 78, and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP)-aligned actors 38.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Together, these 220 posts received over 2 million engagements (likes, comments, and shares) within the first 24 hours after they were published, showing how fast such content can reach voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-aligned entities dominate the engagement share, accounting for more than 1.8 million interactions (90.68 per cent). The AL and the BNP-aligned actors trail far behind with 5.13pc and 3.57pc of the total engagement, respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#targeting-rivals&quot; id=&quot;targeting-rivals&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Targeting rivals&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data show that disinformation in the election season is not random noise but a deliberate tactic aimed at political rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Findings show the Jamaat‑aligned entities directed four of every five (78pc) pieces of disinformation at the BNP, once an ally but now the main political rival. These posts aggressively framed BNP and its leadership as extortionists and criminals, attempting to position Jamaat as the morally superior alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;em&gt;Uttorbongo Television&lt;/em&gt;, which released an AI video featuring a staged interview with an elephant handler who falsely claimed the BNP was the “real extortionist.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP‑aligned actors countered in equal measures, targeting Jamaat with 80pc of their disinformation campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These contents frequently questioned Jamaat’s Islamic credentials and portrayed the party as a threat to the Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, pro‑Awami League entities mostly targeted the interim government and student coordinators. Examples include a widely shared claim that Chief Adviser Dr Muhammad Yunus was plotting a civil war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the political divides, defamation was the dominant weapon. Of the 220 pieces of documented disinformation, 155 were categorised as defamatory. Nearly 90pc of all defamatory content spread by Jamaat-aligned entities targeted the BNP, while almost all defamatory content from BNP-aligned actors focused on Jamaat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides accused each other of criminality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 21, 2025, a high‑engagement post falsely alleged that BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir and his brother ran a multimillion‑taka scheme to smuggle Awami League leaders across the border. But there was no evidence provided against the claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat‑aligned actors also promoted conspiracy narratives, saying the BNP is willing to compromise national interests for Indian favour, including a fabricated story that Tarique Rahman had agreed not to purchase weapons without India’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP‑aligned pages attacked with their own “moral‑corruption” narratives, including a fabricated post accusing Chhatra Shibir activists of partying and drinking after inciting nationwide unrest over Osman Hadi’s killing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro‑Awami League actors, meanwhile, focused on undermining student coordinators, Jamaat, and the interim government. One post falsely claimed that student coordinators attended a DJ party after Osman Hadi’s funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#tactics-employed&quot; id=&quot;tactics-employed&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tactics employed&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly 59pc of the analysed posts were manipulative content, which twisted truth into a false narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, on January 5, 2026, BNP‑aligned political analyst Maruf Mallick made one such post, distorting the findings of the Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances. Although the official report stated that most individuals still missing were from the BNP, Maruf reframed this to allege a “secret understanding” between the Awami League and Jamaat‑Shibir, claiming detainees linked to Jamaat had been quietly released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern was widespread. Of the 62 manipulative posts pushed by Jamaat-aligned entities, 48 targeted the BNP, while pro‑BNP actors produced 18 such posts, almost all aimed at Jamaat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond outright fabrication, political actors also distorted facts by presenting information out of context. Unlike fabrication, which relies on complete falsehoods, decontextualisation manipulates authentic information to construct a misleading narrative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the content analysed, 27 posts fell into this category, where real statements or events were reframed to serve partisan agendas. For example, one video post claimed to show a scene where a BNP leader harassed a freedom fighter. However, the video appears to show someone asking another person to change his seat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Entities that appear to support the Awami League mostly pushed narratives of minority persecution, exaggerating isolated incidents into claims of widespread violence, and invoking calls for foreign intervention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#medium-used&quot; id=&quot;medium-used&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Medium used&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While videos remain the dominant vehicle for disinformation, recent patterns show the growing popularity of photocards. Of the 220 disinformation items analysed, 104 were videos and 44 photocards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly one‑third of the disinformation posts relied on forged documents or fabricated quotes, with 75 such instances identified. These were split evenly between pro‑Jamaat and pro‑Awami League pages and users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deepfakes and other AI‑generated content formed the second most common category, totalling 58 documented cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pro‑Jamaat entities produced the highest number in this category with 27 instances, followed by pro‑BNP actors with 17, and pro‑Awami League entities with 14.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 220 posts analysed were collected by monitoring a watchlist of 615 Facebook pages and profiles known for spreading disinformation and hate speech. The watchlist was compiled through a rigorous, political party-blind selection process involving manual monitoring, targeted keyword searches, and cross-referencing with independent fact-checking resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political alignment was assessed by manually reviewing the most recent 30 posts of each actor before data collection began in mid-December. No official party links were examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the watchlist, 27.4pc appeared AL-aligned, 25.57pc Jamaat-aligned and 14.5 BNP-aligned. The others included National Citizen Party, meme pages, unaffiliated content creators and other foreign entities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The recent US-Bangladesh trade deal, finalized on February 9, 2026, represents an upper hand in economic preservation, securing Dhaka’s US$8 billion export corridor to the US amid an increasingly protectionist global landscape.&amp;#160; While some analysts, including those at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) think tank, have characterized the bilateral pact as a hurried capitulation, [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bidding on batsmen comes to a close at Pakistan Super League 11 auction in Lahore</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972508/bidding-on-batsmen-comes-to-a-close-at-pakistan-super-league-11-auction-in-lahore</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first-ever player auction for the 11th edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) is currently underway in Lahore, with the eight franchises now bidding on fast bowlers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967839&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the bidding for fast bowlers, Muhammad Ali was sold off to Hyderabad Houstan Kingsmen in a last-minute bid of Rs21.5m against Rawalpindi’s Rs20.5m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next up was Chris Jordan, who went unsold after receiving zero bids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#david-warner-goes-to-karachi-kings&quot; id=&quot;david-warner-goes-to-karachi-kings&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;David Warner goes to Karachi Kings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second round began with Barbadian cricketer Kyle Mayers at the base price of Rs1.1m, who went unsold after no bids were made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Zealand’s Colin Munroe went unsold as well. Karachi Kings bagged Australian batsman David Warner at Rs79m after a round of back-and-forth bidding with Peshawar Zalmi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South African batsman Rilee Rossouw was sold off to Quetta Gladiators for Rs55m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#islamabad-united-bags-all-rounder-faheem-ashraf&quot; id=&quot;islamabad-united-bags-all-rounder-faheem-ashraf&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Islamabad United bags all-rounder Faheem Ashraf&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction began with bidding on all-rounders, starting with Faheem Ashraf at the base price of Rs42m, with Islamabad United putting in the final bid at Rs85m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second all-rounder to be auctioned was Imaad Wasim at Rs42m, followed by Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz at the base price of Rs1.1m; however, no bids were made by any of the teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All-rounders Hussain Talat, Asif Afridi, Danish Aziz, and Muhammad Zeeshan at the base price of Rs1.1m received no bids as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the ceremony, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) PSL Salman Naseer addressed the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the HBL PSL X ended, and the euphoria died down a little, and we looked ahead at the path in front of us, all commercial contracts had come to an end…monumental challenges lay ahead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PSL and PCB team have burnt out midnight oil day in and day out to get us where we are today,” Naseer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB, in a statement issued today, said that over 800 players have registered for the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the cricket board shared the base prices for players, with the top bracket set at Rs42 million (platinum), followed by Rs22m (diamond), Rs11m (gold), and Rs6m (silver and emerging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1.5m for bid amounts above Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above-mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad will have a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”, while the number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Millions in Bangladesh vote for a new government. The nation&apos;s vital garment industry faces a crisis. Falling exports stem from U.S. tariffs and local instability. Factory owners seek policy changes and stable energy costs. A new U.S. trade deal offers some duty-free access. This move aims to revive an industry crucial to Bangladesh&apos;s economy.</description>

      <title>Indian cricketer Abhishek Sharma hospitalised ahead of T20 World Cup game with Namibia</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972514/indian-cricketer-abhishek-sharma-hospitalised-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-game-with-namibia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prolific Indian opener Abhishek Sharma has been hospitalised with an upset stomach ahead of the group match against Namibia at the T20 World Cup, a cricket board official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The explosive left-hander is key to India’s chances of defending their title at the 20-team tournament and is doubtful for the Group A fixture on Thursday in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 25-year-old was admitted to a Delhi hospital on Tuesday after he missed training with a stomach issue he carried from the opener in Mumbai, the official told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s assistant coach Ryan ten Doeschate acknowledged the concern on Tuesday, saying the batsman had “still got a few issues with his tummy”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We hope that he’ll be available for the game in a few days’ time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abhishek was out for a duck in India’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971699/suryakumars-unbeaten-84-rescues-india-against-usa-in-t20-world-cup&quot;&gt;win over the United States&lt;/a&gt; but has been a strong performer in the lead-up to the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;play&lt;/a&gt; arch-rivals Pakistan in a blockbuster on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the Pakistani government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it was withdrawing its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;decision to boycott&lt;/a&gt; the match with India, which had been taken previously in the wake of Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replacement&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to tour India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision to move forward with the much-anticipated game came after protracted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;negotiations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between the ICC and the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consultations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among national leaders, and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>All-rounders up for grabs as Pakistan Super League 11 auction commences in Lahore</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972508/all-rounders-up-for-grabs-as-pakistan-super-league-11-auction-commences-in-lahore</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first-ever player auction for the 11th edition of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) has commenced with bidding underway on all-rounders at Lahore’s Expo Centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967839&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the upcoming season of the country’s premier cricket league would adopt an auction model, replacing the previous draft system.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The auction began with bidding on all-rounders, starting with Faheem Ashraf at the base price of Rs42m, with Islamabad United putting in the final bid at Rs85m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second all-rounder to be auctioned was Imaad Wasim at Rs42m, followed by Bangladesh’s Mehidy Hasan Miraz at the base price of Rs1.1m; however, no bids were made by any of the teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the outset of the ceremony, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) PSL Salman Naseer addressed the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the HBL PSL X ended, and the euphoria died down a little, and we looked ahead at the path in front of us, all commercial contracts had come to an end…monumental challenges lay ahead,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PSL and PCB team have burnt out midnight oil day in and day out to get us where we are today,” Naseer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB, in a statement issued today, said that over 800 players have registered for the auction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, the cricket board shared the base prices for players, with the top bracket set at Rs42 million (platinum), followed by Rs22m (diamond), Rs11m (gold), and Rs6m (silver and emerging).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said the minimum incremental bid for each base price would follow as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs250,000 for bid amounts under Rs11m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs500,000 for bid amounts under Rs22m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1m for bid amounts under Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rs1.5m for bid amounts above Rs42m&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchises are free to bid higher than the above-mentioned minimum incremental bid for each base price,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each squad will have a “minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 20 players per franchise”, while the number of foreign players would be five to seven, depending on the squad size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that it would be mandatory for the franchises to include a minimum of three and a maximum of four foreign players in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, it said that the teams would also be required to have a minimum of two uncapped Under-23 players in the squad and one in the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cricket board said, “Players either retained or picked in the HBL PSL 11 Players Auction will be engaged for two-year contracts with their respective franchise teams. After the HBL PSL 11, the franchise teams will be able to retain a maximum of seven players for the 12th edition of the tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following the HBL PSL 12, there shall be a grand auction whereby each franchise is allowed a maximum of five retentions. Any released player will return to the player auction pool,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB said that the franchises would also be entitled to directly sign one foreign player for the upcoming season, who has not played in the previous edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The franchise team’s purse of Rs450m would be extendable to Rs505m to include the directly signed foreign players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The PCB will also contribute towards the procurement of elite foreign players,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament is scheduled to be held from March 26 to May 3. The forthcoming PSL will also feature two new franchises — Hyderabad and Sialkot — raising the total number of teams to 8.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>US trade office removes controversial map of India from social media after Pakistan protests</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972510/us-trade-office-removes-controversial-map-of-india-from-social-media-after-pakistan-protests</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: The United States Trade Representative’s (USTR) office has removed a controversial map of India from its official X (formerly Twitter) account after Pakistan lodged a strong diplomatic protest over the depiction of internationally-recognised disputed territories as part of India, diplomatic sources told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map, which accompanied a USTR press release announcing a framework for an interim US-India trade agreement, showed the entire Jammu and Kashmir region — including Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan — within Indian boundaries. It also depicted China’s Aksai Chin region as part of India, despite the fact that the area is claimed by China and remains &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1772898&quot;&gt;disputed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was posted on the site on Friday evening, but had been removed by Monday evening, which was also the first working day after the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Diplomatic sources said Pakistan conveyed its protest both to the US Embassy in Islamabad and to State Department officials in Washington, stressing that the map contradicted the long-standing and stated US position that Jammu and Kashmir is a disputed territory whose final status must be determined in accordance with relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials familiar with the matter said the map appeared to have been taken from Google Maps, as was the case with a separate map used by the USTR in a press release on a trade deal with Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maps merely showed territorial outlines and did not name any specific areas. However, Pakistani officials pointed out that even an outline map, when issued by an official US government body, carries political and diplomatic weight — particularly on an issue as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971369&quot;&gt;sensitive&lt;/a&gt; as Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concern was heightened after Indian media outlets seized upon the map as evidence of an alleged shift in US policy, portraying it as an implicit endorsement of India’s claims over disputed territories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials said this narrative made it imperative for Islamabad to immediately remind Washington of its traditional and consistent position on Kashmir, and to ensure that no such misinterpretation gained traction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the USTR press release remains available on its website and social media platforms, the specific map of India has since been withdrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the map attached to the USTR’s press release on a trade arrangement with Bangladesh remains online, reinforcing the view that the India map was posted mistakenly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy emerged as Washington and New Delhi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970640&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;, over the weekend, a framework for the first phase of a bilateral trade agreement aimed at boosting two-way commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a joint statement, the US will reduce tariffs on Indian goods to 18 per cent, having already removed an additional 25pc punitive duty. Reciprocal tariffs are also expected to be lowered to similar levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials said the protest was unavoidable, particularly in light of India’s unilateral actions of August 2019, when New Delhi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1498227&quot;&gt;revoked&lt;/a&gt; the special status of occupied Jammu and Kashmir — a move Pakistan rejects as illegal, unconstitutional and in violation of international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamabad maintains that any official depiction suggesting Indian sovereignty over the disputed region undermines the UN-recognised status of the territory and weakens international commitments to neutrality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inclusion of Aksai Chin within Indian territory further compounded concerns, as it misrepresented another unresolved territorial dispute and ran counter to Washington’s stated position of not taking sides in conflicts between India and China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US officials have not publicly commented on the removal of the map. Pakistani diplomats say the episode highlights the need for constant vigilance, as even seemingly technical or symbolic representations by influential international actors can have serious diplomatic consequences on an issue as sensitive and consequential as Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The trade deal that stitches US gains while Bangladesh threads the needle of risk</title>

      <description>Bangladesh&apos;s recent trade agreement with the United States appears to be a double-edged sword for its garment industry. Although it provides zero-duty access, the stipulation to use US-sourced cotton and fibers undermines their competitive edge, given their current dependence on alternative suppliers. Additionally, the obligation to import US agricultural products and energy adds financial strain.</description>

      <title>Bangladeshi woman moves Lahore High Court against ‘unjustified’ offloading by FIA</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972401/bangladeshi-woman-moves-lahore-high-court-against-unjustified-offloading-by-fia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: An elderly woman, who was allegedly born in Bangladesh and was trafficked and sold in Pakistan some 35 years ago, has approached the Lahore High Court against the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for offloading her from a Dhaka-bound flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Razia Bibi, 58, filed a petition through her counsel, Ali Changezi Sandhu, and also sought imposition of a fine on the FIA for offloading her, allegedly without any reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the petition, the counsel alleged that the petitioner was kidnapped in Bangladesh and illegally brought to Pakistan, where she was sold in Karachi some 35 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the petitioner was forced into marriage with her ‘purchaser’ in Pakistan and later shifted to Kasur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the petitioner, who is now a Pakistani citizen, recently reconnected with her Bangladeshi family through social media and her mother pleaded to meet her one last time in her life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawyer stated when the petitioner, on Feb 27, 2025, reached the Allama Iqbal International Airport, Lahore, to travel to Bangladesh, the FIA immigration staff offloaded her without providing any justification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the petitioner filed an application with the interior ministry for action against the “unlawful” act of the FIA officials, but to no avail so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He argued that on the basis of mere suspicion and assumptions regarding illegal travel and human smuggling, thousands of Pakistani youths had been falling &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961655&quot;&gt;victim&lt;/a&gt; to the FIA’s “unlawful offloading”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, offloading an elderly woman without any reason clearly indicates that the FIA engages in illegal practices, the counsel alleged, and sought an order for the agency to compensate the petitioner for the amount she spent on her air ticket and visa fee.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The BCCI and BCB both erred in the Mustafizur Rahman IPL release dispute. BCB&apos;s &quot;safety concern&quot; pretext for avoiding India, fueled by social media, allowed PCB to create unnecessary drama. ICC chairman Jay Shah prioritised cricket, ensuring the tournament proceeded despite Bangladesh&apos;s absence, highlighting the distinct economic value of India-Pakistan matches.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AFTER days-long negotiations, Pakistan moved for the greater good of world cricket when its government gave the national cricket team the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;go-ahead&lt;/a&gt; to play their Twenty20 World Cup match against India on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had earlier &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play the blockbuster fixture, which is the revenue generator for the International Cricket Council, after Scotland had been drafted in to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replace&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh at the World Cup following the latter country’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to travel to India for their matches due to security concerns. The Pakistan Cricket Board had protested the decision of the India-led ICC. While the team was allowed to travel to the tournament it was instructed to forfeit the match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With its finances in danger, the ICC came to the table with its director Imran Khawaja flying to Pakistan over the weekend. Bangladesh Cricket Board chief Aminul Islam also arrived, with Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi at the centre of negotiations. Pakistan had already been requested by Sri Lanka, where the national team is playing their matches of the World Cup, and the UAE to reconsider their decision. The PCB, however, was fighting a bigger battle: to ensure equality in world cricket against the governing body that has for long acted on India’s whims.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In many ways, it has succeeded. The ICC has not penalised Bangladesh, while also granting it hosting rights for a tournament in the 2028-2031 cycle to mitigate the impact from its ouster from the World Cup. It therefore made sense for Pakistan to change their stance; going ahead with the World Cup match against India means ensuring financial security for the cricket world, especially the associate members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should not be forgotten. It should also mark the start of a new era in cricket governance. The politicisation of the sport has been a menace that has hindered the growth of the game for long. Sports should not be used as a propagation of political messaging and it is high time this practice was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the arrangement between Pakistan and India, which sees both sides play their matches of an event in either country at neutral venues, ends, the ICC should look to ensuring that it normalises bilateral cricketing ties between the two arch-rivals. That would embellish the ICC’s legitimacy as a neutral body that is focused on making sure that the game stays above petty politicking.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>&apos;Bangladesh has no money&apos;: Former diplomat on Dhaka&apos;s Boeing jets purchase under US trade deal</title>

      <description>India need not be concerned about the new trade agreement between Bangladesh and the United States. Former Indian envoy Veena Sikri states Bangladesh cannot afford the promised Boeing jet purchases. She also notes that Bangladesh&apos;s access to US markets is tied to sourcing materials like yarn and cotton from the USA. India already supplies these competitively and quickly.</description>

      <title>Over 150,000 cops to guard ‘risky’ polling stations in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972439/over-150000-cops-to-guard-risky-polling-stations-in-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s police chief said on Tuesday that more than 150,000 officers will be deployed for this week’s elections, warning that more than half of polling stations were flagged as vulnerable to violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police records show that five people were killed and more than 600 injured in political clashes during the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972185&quot;&gt; campaign&lt;/a&gt; period from Dec 11 to Feb 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 157,000 police officers, backed by 100,000 soldiers and other security forces, will guard Thursday’s vote — the first since a mass uprising toppled the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are 1,000 per cent confident about doing our part,” Inspector General of Police Baharul Alam told reporters in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarique Rahman warns of ‘huge’ challenges ahead&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country of 170 million has remained in political turmoil since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;uprising&lt;/a&gt; against Hasina, when police carried out a deadly crackdown during her failed bid to cling to power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alam said police had assessed that “more than 24,000 polling centres have been marked as either high-risk or moderately risky” for possible unrest, violence or ballot stuffing — more than half of the 42,000 centres nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The location of some centres is very remote, and there is intense competition, and hostility among candidates and their supporters,” he said, adding that 1,300 police guns looted during the 2024 unrest have still not been recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In high-risk and moderately risky centres, police will carry out patrol duty with body-worn cameras for the first time,” Alam said. He added that police were determined to ensure the polls were peaceful, but said he accepted that distrust of his force remained.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is quite understandable why people do not trust the police,” he said, adding: “Over the last 15 ye­­a­rs, based on what we have delivered — in fact, for the last 150 years, our predecessors mostly beat people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Bangla­de­sh’s leading prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman said on Tuesday he faces “huge” challenges if he wins elections this week, vowing to repair a country he said was looted under the previous ousted government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need to ensure a normal situation in the country, so that people are safe,” Rahman told &lt;em&gt;AFP.&lt;/em&gt; But he warned the task ahead would be daunting.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Younger Bangladesh voters primed for first post-Hasina election</title>

      <description>Millions of young Bangladeshis will vote for the first time on Thursday in a landmark election to determine the country&apos;s leadership following a 2024 student-led uprising that ended former prime minister Sheikh Hasina&apos;s autocratic rule. Young people aged from 18 to 27 make up 44 percent of the country&apos;s 129 million voters, many who say they never voted during Hasina&apos;s 15-year iron-fisted tenure.</description>

      <title>EU parliament adopts twin texts hardening migration policy</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972438/eu-parliament-adopts-twin-texts-hardening-migration-policy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;STRASBOURG: The European Parliament on Tuesday definitively adopted two flagship texts tightening EU migration policy, championed by an alliance of right-wing and far-right lawmakers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is seeking to make it easier for its 27 member states to send asylum seekers to countries they did not come from but that Europe deems “safe”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Italy has sought to test the concept with centres in Albania. The migrant centres have, however, largely stood empty since being opened in 2024 because of legal challenges, with many Italian judges viewing the scheme as unconstitutional. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the EU measures adopted on Tuesday is expected to facilitate this approach, to the dismay of human rights advocates and left-wing groups, who warn about the treatment asylum seekers may face in such countries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Green MEP Melissa Camara called it “another step in the dehumanisation of the European Union’s migration policy,” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;charging that the dignity of asylum seekers was being “trampled” on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission rejects the criticism, insisting that any country receiving migrants under the scheme must respect fundamental rights. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another key measure approved by parliament is the creation of a list of countries the EU considers “safe” — effectively limiting asylum prospects for their nationals. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list, which includes Kosovo, Bangladesh, Colombia, Egypt, India, Morocco and Tunisia, is intended to speed up the processing of asylum claims and, where appropriate, accelerate returns. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Citizens expect us to deliver on our promises regarding migration policy, and that is exactly what we are doing today,” conservative lawmaker Lena Dupont told the assembly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU’s political centre of gravity has shifted firmly right in recent years, and a decline in irregular entries — down around 25 per cent in 2025 compared to 2024 — has not eased the political pressure to act on the hot-button issue. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly one million people applied for asylum in the EU last year and about 440,000 were granted protection.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Jamaat e-Islami, oppressed under Sheikh Hasina’s rule, could take unprecedented share of the vote on Thursday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the clock hit midnight, the women held their flame torches aloft and marched into the Dhaka night. “The people have given their blood, now we want equality,” they shouted above the roar of the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many in Bangladesh, the past few weeks have been a cause for jubilation. The first free and fair elections in 17 years have been promised for Thursday, after the toppling of the regime of Sheikh Hasina in a bloody student-led uprising in August 2024 in which more than 1,000 people died.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/11/bangladesh-election-islamist-party-women-freedoms&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>The earlier state of limbo about the overhyped clash, between India and Pakistan in Colombo on February 15, was caused by an over-reaction from the Pakistan Cricket Board, which stated that since Bangladesh was removed from the championship, Agha’s men will not play against the Men in Blue!</description>

      <title>Bangladesh will replace Indian cotton with U.S. cotton: Interim government</title>
      <link>https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/bangladesh-will-replace-indian-cotton-with-us-cotton-interim-government/article70615448.ece</link>
      <description>Information adviser Shafiqul Alam says the U.S.-Bangladesh trade deal inked on Monday is a ‘game changer’ that can further open up the U.S. market for Bangladesh. In April 2025, Bangladesh restricted yarn imports from India through its land ports after bilateral ties soured. In May 2025, India imposed curbs on imports of readymade garments and other items from Bangladesh through land ports.</description>

      <title>Only purpose was to get respect for Bangladesh, says PCB chief Naqvi after talks with ICC</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972277/only-purpose-was-to-get-respect-for-bangladesh-says-pcb-chief-naqvi-after-talks-with-icc</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday said in the context of his recent engagements with Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and International Cricket Council (ICC) officials that the purpose was to “get respect for Bangladesh”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi said this while speaking to the media in Peshawar, a day after the government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it was withdrawing its decision to boycott the group-stage match against India in the T20 World Cup, scheduled for February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development followed protracted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;negotiations&lt;/a&gt; between the ICC, the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;consultations&lt;/a&gt; among national leaders and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The now-withdrawn decision to boycott the match against arch-rival India was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; by the government on February 1 after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The matter was raised during Naqvi’s media talk in Peshawar on Tuesday, where he was asked about several conditions that were reportedly put forward during his meeting with the ICC and BCB officials on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his response, Naqvi said: “We did not discuss anything apart from Bangladesh; our only purpose was to get Bangladesh respect, to highlight the injustice done to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“And you saw that whatever demands Bangladesh made, they were accepted. That’s it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added, “We had no personal interest in the meeting … our task was purely related to Bangladesh. The government made the decision on that [basis]. When their demands have been accepted, and it has been acknowledged that injustice was done to them, we are playing after that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developments unfolded as the ongoing T20 World Cup, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, began on February 7. It was, however, overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refused&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;remained firm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on not taking part in the event after the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969929/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rejected&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;request&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mulling its stance, Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave its cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expressed the hope that the PCB would consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country. Subsequently, it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week that the ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board had also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the BCB chief and ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja landed in Lahore and held a long meeting with Naqvi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day later, Sri Lankan President Dissanayake also urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;phone call&lt;/a&gt; with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Meanwhile, BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government then announced the withdrawal of its earlier decision to boycott the match against India while an ICC statement said “that no financial, sporting or administrative penalty will be imposed on Bangladesh Cricket Board”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement also said that to compensate Dhaka, it was agreed that the country would host an ICC event prior to the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup 2031.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The ghosts of the old guard won’t be on the ballot in Dhaka this week, but they are haunting every corner of the campaign trail. When Bangladeshis head to the polls on February 12, they are performing a high-stakes autopsy on a collapsed autocracy and attempting to breathe life into a republic that is nearly [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Cricket Board Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on Tuesday said in context of his recent engagements with Bangladesh Cricket Board and International Cricket Council officials that their purpose was to get respect for Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi said this while speaking to the media in Peshawar a day the Pakistani government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it was withdrawing its decision to boycott the group-stage match against India in T20 World Cup, scheduled for February 15.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;span&gt;Bangladesh election reveals a transformed political landscape&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Expert comment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;LToremark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2026-02-10T11:06:55+00:00&quot; title=&quot;Tuesday, 10 February, 2026&quot;&gt;10 February 2026&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s long-awaited election is being shaped by new political forces and intensified information warfare.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class=&quot;media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;img alt=&quot;Students paint a mural in the colours of the Bangladesh national flag.&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2026-02/2026-02-10-bangladesh-election-2165625477.jpg?itok=CBc2-8eR&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Bangladesh is set to hold its long-anticipated national election on 12 February 2026. The election follows 18 months of an interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, after the government of Sheikh Hasina was ousted in 2024 by the Gen Z- led ‘Monsoon Revolution’.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This election is a potential turning point towards democratic transition. It is also consequential due to two broader dynamics at play: the emergence of new political actors and the intensification of information warfare. But with so much at stake, political violence and unrest is rife. Since the election was announced in December, at least &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2026/1/27/fear-and-hope-in-bangladesh-how-political-violence-is-haunting-elections&quot;&gt;16 political activists&lt;/a&gt; have been killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;New political forces and a changing opposition landscape&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant developments in this election is the emergence of new political coalitions that challenge the long-standing dominance of two parties: Hasina’s Awami League party and the main opposition party, the BNP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Awami League has been banned under the Anti-Terrorism Act and will not be taking part in the election. The new chairman of the BNP, Tarique Rahman, has recently returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in exile following the death of his mother and longtime BNP leader, Khaleda Zia. Rahman is one of the frontrunners to be prime minister – if the BNP performs well in the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A notable new political coalition is the 11-party alliance led by Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami and the National Citizen Party (NCP). This marks a major reconfiguration of the opposition landscape – one which aims to disrupt Bangladesh’s dynastic political system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NCP was born from the 2024 student uprising. Its unexpected electoral alliance with the more conservative Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami reflects strategic compromise rather than ideological alignment. The decision to join forces followed the murder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/12/19/who-was-osman-hadi-why-is-bangladesh-on-fire-over-his-death&quot;&gt;Sharif Osman Hadi&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent student leader, independent MP candidate and vocal critic of India and the Awami League. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;align-right embedded-entity embed&quot;&gt;

                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;h5 teaser__title&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;India wants to reset relations after Bangladesh elections. It will be easier said than done&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        
      &lt;/header&gt;

                    
      
              
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi investigators have charged &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/crime-and-law/825h0mwrl7&quot;&gt;17 people&lt;/a&gt; in connection to Hadi’s murder, some of whom they say have links to the Awami League. Hadi’s supporters allege an Indian connection to the murder – an allegation New Delhi denies. NCP leaders argue the killing highlights threats from ‘hegemonic forces’, making independent political participation risky.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some NCP leaders and founding members have strongly opposed the alliance with Bangladesh Jamaat and even resigned in protest, citing Jamaat’s controversial past and stance on &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/politics/f703hmqibu&quot;&gt;women within the party&lt;/a&gt;. The majority, however, view it as a pragmatic step. NCP convener Nahid Islam &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jagonews24.com/en/politics/news/89441&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that the party has not abandoned its reform agenda, emphasizing that the NCP’s separate election manifesto underscores its commitment to democracy and equality. Moreover, although Jamaat is the only party with a strong opposition to women in political leadership roles, all the participating parties have fallen short of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhakatribune.com/opinion/editorial/402155/there-is-no-new-bangladesh-without-women&quot;&gt;5 per cent pledge&lt;/a&gt; for women’s representation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This alliance between two seemingly very different parties has also gained momentum because of their shared opposition to Indian influence. Both parties demand Hasina’s extradition from India and justice for Hadi. By contrast, senior BNP leaders have openly invited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.observerbd.com/news/524646&quot;&gt;‘disillusioned’&lt;/a&gt; Awami League members with ‘clean records’ to join the party, although individuals involved in corruption, extortion or violence will be barred. Their outreach appears to have worked. Opinion polls show nearly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh-election-2026/voter-interest-above-90-nearly-half-al-voters-shifting-bnp-survey-1351951&quot;&gt;48 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of Awami League voters are shifting to BNP.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A pre-election survey shows a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/election/402911/iild-survey-jamaat-led-alliance-bnp-in-close&quot;&gt;tight race&lt;/a&gt; between the BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami, with limited support for others. Survey &lt;a href=&quot;https://eng.bangladeshsomoy.com/public/national/6964ec474af98&quot;&gt;evidence&lt;/a&gt; shows clear demographic and motivational differences: Jamaat attracts younger and more educated voters for its perceived discipline and integrity; BNP draws mainly working-age voters, farmers and labourers for its past governance record; while NCP supporters cite its role in the 2024 revolution. Young voters (18–37) make up 44 per cent of the electorate and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/news/young-voters-poised-shape-next-election-4077266&quot;&gt;may decide&lt;/a&gt; the outcome, along with undecided voters.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new 11-party coalition has received mixed reactions &amp;nbsp;from citizens – and seems to illustrate of the tension between political survival and ideological principle in Bangladesh’s increasingly volatile political landscape. Although joining the coalition expands the NCP’s reach, it risks weakening its identity as a genuine political alternative if voters become unsure what the party really stands for.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BNP, meanwhile, will benefit from the absence of the Awami League, but the party must deal with internal divisions exposed by the death of Khaleda Zia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Information warfare&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The run-up to this election has been heavily shaped by an information war. As political parties and independent candidates use social media to run their campaigns and simultaneously challenge each other’s narratives, the widespread use of bot-generated comments and emojis to influence voter opinion is evident. Serious concerns have also been raised by misinformation and disinformation campaigns, as well as AI-generated deepfakes. Social media has seen a surge of short, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/out-context-videos-manipulate-religious-sentiment-ahead-polls-4096601&quot;&gt;decontextualized video clips&lt;/a&gt; of political leaders’ remarks on religion, which are being used to provoke outrage and manipulate voter sentiment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a growing wave of disinformation from abroad. In January, Yunus reportedly &amp;nbsp;warned of a ‘flood’ of foreign disinformation in the run up to the election, during a call to the UN. Rumor Scanner Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.prothomalo.com/bangladesh/y8yewssuhy&quot;&gt;claims&lt;/a&gt; that last year 73 Indian news outlets, and the ousted Awami League, published 140 reports containing false or misleading information about Bangladesh. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh/indian-media-al-spreading-disinformation-about-bangladesh-press-secretary-1350586&quot;&gt;Yunus’s press secretary&lt;/a&gt; also recently claimed that Indian media was responsible for spreading ‘alarming false narratives’ about Bangladesh. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/42037d486c06&quot;&gt;misogynistic post&lt;/a&gt; from Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman’s verified X account sparked widespread outrage and campus protests, with BNP critics saying it demeaned women’s leadership. But Jamaat claims that the accounts of its top leaders, including Rahman, were hacked using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tbsnews.net/bangladesh-election-2026/jamaat-alleges-leaders-x-accounts-hacked-using-india-origin-malware&quot;&gt;India-origin malware&lt;/a&gt; sent via emails linked to the president’s office and the Bangladesh Computer Council as part of a coordinated cyberattack aimed at undermining national sovereignty and the election process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Shafiqur Rahman, Jamaat-e-Islami&apos;s chief, has emerged as a significant contender for Bangladesh&apos;s prime minister after decades on the political fringe. Capitalizing on a post-uprising vacuum, Rahman has revitalized the once-banned party, presenting it as a moral alternative guided by Islamic values, though his views on women have drawn controversy.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s Tarique Rahman: From exile to edge of power</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-from-exile-to-edge-of-power</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Less than two months after&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963315&quot;&gt; returning &lt;/a&gt;from nearly two decades of self-imposed exile in London, Tarique Rahman could win one of Bangladesh’s most pivotal elections and become prime minister, leading the country as his parents once did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If opinion polls hold, Thursday’s election would mark a remarkable reversal of fortune for the soft-spoken 60-year-old, who left the country in 2008, saying he needed medical treatment after his release from detention under a military-backed caretaker administration. He had been held after a crackdown on corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Army personnel patrol the streets ahead of the national election in Dhaka, Bangladesh, February 10, 2026. &amp;mdash;Reuters&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/101310582212f07.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He returned home to a hero’s welcome last Christmas after a youth-driven uprising uprooted his Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s arch-enemy, long-time premier Sheikh Hasina of the Awami League, in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, now in&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt; exile &lt;/a&gt;in New Delhi, and Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, long dominated Bangladeshi politics, while Rahman’s father was a leading Bangladesh independence figure who ruled the country from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman has pledged to recalibrate Bangladesh’s international partnerships to attract investment without tying the country too closely to any single power, in contrast with Hasina, who was seen as aligned with New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman has also highlighted expanding financial aid for poor families, reducing reliance on garment exports by promoting industries such as toys and leather goods, and introducing a two-term, 10-year limit for prime ministers to deter autocratic tendencies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Events have unfolded so quickly since Rahman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963085&quot;&gt;landed &lt;/a&gt;in Dhaka with his cardiologist wife and barrister daughter that he said he has scarcely had time to reflect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t know how we have passed every minute since we landed,” Rahman said on the sidelines of an interview with &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; in his party office, flanked by his daughter Zaima, who has been trying to drum up support for her father.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bespectacled Rahman was born on November 20, 1965, in Dhaka to Khaleda and former president Ziaur Rahman, the founder of the BNP. He studied international relations at the University of Dhaka, dropped out, and later started businesses in textiles and agricultural products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since his return, Rahman has tried to project himself as a statesman ready to look beyond his family’s difficulties under Hasina. Gone is the image of a brash operator from the BNP’s 2001–2006 era, when his mother was prime minister. Although he never held a government post, Rahman was often accused of running a parallel power centre during her tenure, a charge he denies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What does revenge bring to someone? People have to flee from this country because of revenge. This does not bring anything good,” he said. “What we need at the moment in the country is peace and stability.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Hasina’s rule, Rahman became a central target of corruption cases and was convicted in absentia in several of them. In 2018, he was also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1876006&quot;&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to life over a 2004 grenade attack on a rally Hasina was addressing that killed and wounded many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has always denied the allegations, calling them politically motivated, and has since been acquitted in all cases following Hasina’s ouster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From London, he had watched his party marginalised election after election, with senior leaders jailed, workers disappearing, and offices shuttered.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since returning, Rahman has adopted a noticeably understated style, avoiding inflammatory rhetoric and calling instead for restraint and reconciliation. He has spoken of restoring people’s ownership of the state and rebuilding institutions — a message that has energised BNP supporters eager for a fresh start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further helping to soften his image, the family’s fluffy Siberian cat, Jebu, has gone viral on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She’s 7. She’s half Siberian. We adopted her,” Rahman’s daughter Zaima told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the BNP, Rahman’s grip on the party is strong. Party insiders say he is directly overseeing candidate selection, strategy and alliance talks, roles he once performed remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He may be a product of dynastic politics, but Rahman said restoring and sustaining democracy would be his biggest priority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Only by practising democracy can we prosper and rebuild our country. If we practise democracy, we can establish accountability,” he said. “So we want to practise democracy, we want to rebuild our country.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PAF’s participation in Saudi defence expo reinforces Pakistan’s position as ‘emerging hub of aerospace innovation’: ISPR</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972255/pafs-participation-in-saudi-defence-expo-reinforces-pakistans-position-as-emerging-hub-of-aerospace-innovation-ispr</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Air Force’s participation in the ongoing World Defence Show 2026 (WDS-26) in Saudi Arabia highlights the country’s role as an emerging hub for aerospace innovation, operational competence, and reliable defence solutions, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[The] World Defence Show 2026 serves as a premier global platform for defence and security,” the press release said. “PAF’s participation at WDS-2026 reinforces Pakistan’s position as an emerging hub of aerospace innovation, operational competence and reliable defence solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube_short  media__item--relative&quot;&gt;    &lt;div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ISPR added that the participation in the show underscored PAF’s commitment to showcasing Pakistan’s “rapidly advancing indigenous aerospace capabilities and its proven operational excellence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military’s media wing added that the force will feature its “cutting-edge &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;JF-17&lt;/a&gt; Thunder Block-III multi-role fighter jet and the highly acclaimed Super Mushshak basic trainer aircraft”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The JF-17 Block-III, representing the pinnacle of Pakistan’s combat aviation technology, features state-of-the-art avionics, an advanced AESA (Active Electronically Scanned Array) radar, enhanced electronic warfare suite and beyond-visual-range combat capabilities, making it a formidable 4.5 generation fighter jet addressing the operational needs of modern air forces,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Alongside it, the Super Mushshak trainer aircraft highlights Pakistan’s strength in pilot training solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Renowned for its reliability, cost-effectiveness and ease of maintenance, the Super Mushshak has been successfully inducted by several friendly countries and continues to serve as a benchmark platform for basic flying training worldwide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the ISPR statement, PAF’s presence at WDS-2026 reflects its leadership’s vision of fostering defence cooperation, promoting defence exports and strengthening strategic partnerships with friendly nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that participation provides an opportunity for international delegations, defence officials and military industry leaders to engage with PAF representatives and “explore avenues for collaboration, training and technology transfer”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in January, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967005&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that several countries were in active talks with Islamabad to procure the JF-17 fighter aircraft, which became a centre of attention following the India-Pakistan conflict in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indonesia, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia have expressed interest in buying the fighter jets, while Azerbaijan inducted this aircraft into its air force in 2024. Azerbaijan had become the third country to acquire JF-17 fighters after Myanmar and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Sri Lanka played a key mediating role in clearing the deadlock over the India–Pakistan match at the T20 World Cup in Colombo, following diplomatic outreach led by President Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The efforts, supported by Bangladesh, UAE and other nations, helped pave the way for the high-profile fixture. The ICC later confirmed the match would proceed as planned.</description>

      <title>COAS Munir lauds ‘character, courage, competence’ shown by soldiers in ongoing fight against terrorism</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972253/coas-munir-lauds-character-courage-competence-shown-by-soldiers-in-ongoing-fight-against-terrorism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir lauded the “character, courage, and competence” demonstrated by soldiers in the ongoing fight against terrorism, the Inter-Service Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an ISPR &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7615&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, the CDF made these remarks while addressing the closing ceremony of the 9th International Pakistan Army Team Spirit (PATS) Competition as the chief guest on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaffirming the core values of the army, the CDF “underscored the enduring soldierly attributes of ‘character, courage and competence’, which have been consistently demonstrated by Pakistani soldiers, particularly in the ongoing fight against terrorism”, the military’s media wing said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/RadioPakistan/status/2021088816489259189&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Field Marshal Munir also “commended all participating teams for their exceptional professionalism, physical and mental endurance, operational competence and high morale displayed during the exercise”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He emphasised the importance of such multinational engagements in enhancing collective preparedness and adapting to the evolving character of modern warfare,” the press release added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISPR described PATS Competition as a 60-hour-long patrolling exercise, designed to “enhance professional military skills through the exchange of innovative ideas, tactical experiences and best practices among participating teams”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exercise, held from February 5 to 9, was carried out in the semi-mountainous terrain of Punjab, “providing a realistic and challenging operational environment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the years, PATS has evolved into a prestigious and highly competitive military exercise, recognised for promoting professional excellence and mutual learning among participating nations,” the statement noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It affirmed that the forum “continues to strengthen military-to-military cooperation and understanding, while fostering camaraderie and team spirit in a demanding operational setting”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year’s PATS Competition featured 19 countries — including Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Malaysia, Maldives, Morocco, Nepal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Turkiye, the United States of America, and Uzbekistan — while Indonesia, Myanmar, and Thailand attended the exercise as observers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, 16 domestic teams from the army and the navy, along with observers from the air force, also participated in the event, ISPR stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CDF also presented awards to the outstanding participants of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“International observers and defence attachés from participating countries also attended the event and expressed appreciation for high standard of professionalism, organisation, and conduct demonstrated throughout the exercise,” the press release read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the CDF also witnessed miscellaneous training activities at the National Counter Terrorism Centre in Pabbi, including a visit to the newly established Tactical Simulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He lauded the efforts of troops and the technical team and emphasised the importance of simulator-based training to complement traditional training methods, ISPR said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Air Force’s participation in the ongoing World Defence Show 2026 (WDS-26) in Saudi Arabia highlights the country’s role as an emerging hub for aerospace innovation, operational competence, and reliable defence solutions, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘Great for competition and cricket’: Reactions pour in to Pakistan’s decision to play India in the T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972249/great-for-competition-and-cricket-reactions-pour-in-to-pakistans-decision-to-play-india-in-the-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Cricket commentators, journalists and political figures reacted on Tuesday to the government’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; that Pakistan would play the T20 World Cup match against India, scheduled for February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had previously vowed to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; the match, in support of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; after the International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected its plea to let it play its matches against India in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Pakistan’s decision to play India was made after an ICC delegation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt; in the country over the weekend and held meetings with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match. Sri Lanka had also urged Pakistan to play India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the decision, Sri Lanka’s Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath thanked PM Shehbaz, as well as Pakistan’s government and Foreign Office (FO), on social media for “positively considering Sri Lanka’s request” to play its T20 clash against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I also appreciate the PCB and Pakistan’s sports authorities for their cooperation. A gesture that reflects sportsmanship, friendship, and the strength of our bilateral ties,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called PM Shehbaz yesterday, had expressed delight at the decision and thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Journalist Faizan Lakhani reposted the statement, commenting, “When a head of state publicly thanks Pakistan for agreeing to play a match that doesn’t even involve his own team, it’s clear this was bigger than sport.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the statement by the Sri Lankan president highlighted Pakistan’s importance in world cricket and showed that “government-level intervention was needed to resolve a serious standoff” and keep the game on course.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, former cricketer Shahid Afridi praised the decision, saying, “The spirit of cricket has prevailed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the government of Pakistan had “protected the sanctity of the T20 World Cup and ensured the game’s global stability” with their decision to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cricket wins, which means it will continue to play its pivotal role of bridging the widest of divides.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former English cricketer Michael Vaughan termed the decision to play “great for the competition and cricket”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We need them to somehow play a Test series soon as well … “[the] UK would be a great place to host a three-match series,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian cricket commentator and journalist Harsha Bhogle suggested that the decision to play had been inevitable, saying, “Pakistan were always going to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was clear as daylight. Withdrawal was never even a possibility.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Veteran Indian journalist Pradeep Magazine told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; “good sense has prevailed on all sides”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Financial considerations would have been taken into account, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“India-Pakistan is not just about cricket revenue — it also means wider commercial revenue,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everyone realised that losing the revenue from an India-Pakistan match would have been a loss-loss situation for all ICC member nations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also posted on social media on Tuesday morning, “India may be the economic driver behind cricket and generate revenues and huge money for the game but it needs teams to play against to do so. Sports does not exist in a vacuum.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, former India cricketer Madan Lal told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;: “Pakistan did shake up the ICC by repeatedly saying they would not play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Eventually, the ICC had to send officials to Pakistan to sort out the issue” and that was ‘good for cricket’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We want strong teams to play so that the charm of the World Cup is not lost,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lal also posted on X that “Bangladesh solved the problem for ICC. They told Pakistan to play the game on the 15th. What happened behind closed doors nobody knows.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladesh has secured a reduced 19 percent tariff on exports to the United States under a new trade agreement announced by interim chief Muhammad Yunus. The deal offers zero-tariff access for select textiles made with U.S. cotton and includes commitments on agriculture, energy imports, and trade reforms. The U.S. remains Bangladesh’s largest export market, and analysts say the agreement brings crucial relief to apparel exporters.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh poll race heats up on final day of campaigning</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972185/bangladesh-poll-race-heats-up-on-final-day-of-campaigning</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Tens of thousands of supporters attend rival rallies across Dhaka&lt;br /&gt;• Voters will elect lawmakers to a 350-seat parliament&lt;br /&gt;• BNP, led by Khaleda Zia’s son Tarique, widely seen as a frontrunner&lt;br /&gt;• BNP’s main rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, led by Shafiqur Rahman, allied with the student-led National Citizen Party&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s election &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968417&quot;&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt; entered its final day on Monday before this week’s vote, with rival parties invoking the 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters attended a series of rival rallies across the sprawling capital Dhaka, as parties sought to harness the legacy of the mass uprising and pitch competing visions of change for the country of 170 million in Thursday’s election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Asian nation will elect a 350-seat parliament, with the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — led by Tarique Rahman, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; in December after 17 years in exile — widely tipped as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s key rival is Jamaat-i-Islami, Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party that is led by Shafiqur Rahman and has allied with the National Citizen Party (NCP) that was formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime ministerial hopeful Tarique Rahman appeared confident as he bounced on stage to address a crowd of thousands of BNP loyalists who waved flags and the party symbol, a sheaf of rice, and greeted their leader as if at a rock concert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP alone has a plan to run the country and the experience to do so,” he said, referring to his late parents, Ziaur Rahman and Khaleda Zia, who both led the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No other parties have that.” Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP from his mother, Khaleda Zia, who died in December at the age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police ringed the stage as he spoke and watched from the tops of tower blocks surveying the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Justice’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;overthrown&lt;/a&gt; on August 5, 2024, after 15 years in power and her Awami League party was banned by the interim government from running in the elections, a move criticised by rights groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 78-year-old, known for her iron-fisted rule, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to death in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power and remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-i-Islami chief Shafiqur Rahman, leading a coalition of Islamist parties ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood — under the symbol of weighing scales — also headed packed rallies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If Jamaat comes to power, extortion and violence will reduce,” said Ashikuzzaman Shaon, a 21-year-old student. “They’ll establish justice.” The Jamaat chief has accused the former ruling party of widespread repression, but also warned that new forms of abuse had quickly followed its fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A section of the oppressed turned into oppressors just a day after August 5,” he told a rally on Sunday, alleging extortion and corruption by returning political figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Common people, business owners — even beggars — are now fed up. Justice has been sent into exile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Long live the revolution’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat’s ally, NCP leader Nahid Islam, has also accused major parties of quietly sharing the “businesses of extortion and crime” for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you elect me, I will dedicate myself to the betterment of the area,” Islam said, thanking women supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we lose, August 5 will also lose.” Supporters chanted popular slogans from the uprising, including “Long live the revolution!” “Slavery or freedom?”, they chanted, replying in unison, “Freedom, freedom!” Among the crowds on Monday was Tota Mia, 58, a rickshaw puller who had attended rallies on all sides and took a pragmatic approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve seen everyone,” he said. “And this time I will vote for Jamaat. It doesn’t matter if I eat more or I eat less, I just want peace.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Feb 10 - China’s influence in Bangladesh, boosted by the 2024 ouster of New Delhi‑aligned leader Sheikh Hasina, is likely to deepen after this week&apos;s election, although politicians and analysts say India is too large a neighbour to be sidelined completely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PSL franchise Multan Sultans sold for record Rs2.45bn; new owner says name will be changed to Rawalpindi</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972074/psl-franchise-multan-sultans-sold-for-record-rs245bn-new-owner-says-name-will-be-changed-to-rawalpindi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Super League franchise (PSL) Multan Sultans on Monday was sold to Walee Technologies for a record Rs2.45 billion ahead of the tournament’s 11th edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the auction in Lahore, show host Fakhr-i-Alam informed bidders that the winning bid would also cover the annual fee to maintain ownership of the team for the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/MultanSultans/status/2020864897551106059&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the auction ceremony, the new owner of the team announced that they would be changing the name to Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Are you ready for a surprise? We will be going for Rawalpindi!” announced the company’s chief executive officer, Ahsan Tahir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the ceremony, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi congratulated Walee Technologies on their successful bid and expressed gratitude to former board chairman Najam Sethi for his vision for the Multan Sultans franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Multan Sultans was created by Najam Sethi &lt;em&gt;sahib&lt;/em&gt;; we are so pleased he is with us today,” Naqvi said, inviting Sethi onto the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Sethi said, “I’m obviously delighted to be here; this is the culmination of a dream come true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m obviously over the moon that it’s come through under Mohsin Naqvi, who is a dear, dear friend of mine,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sethi hailed the winning bid as a “great moment for Pakistan cricket”, adding that Naqvi would give good news “beyond PSL” over the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, at a press conference with representatives from Walee Technologies, Naqvi said that the future of the Multan Sultans brand would have to be considered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot ask the person paying Rs2.45bn to keep the name Multan Sultans,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we discussed auctioning Multan Sultans, we planned to keep it for one or two years. But there was a good environment in the market and we were already auctioning five or six teams,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCB chief noted that there were concerns, given the brand’s age and the possibility of damage to its reputation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For me, Multan Sultans is very close to my heart, so we will come up with a solution,” Naqvi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about the criteria for setting the opening bid at Rs1.82bn, he replied that it was the second-highest bid for the Sialkot team, which was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965821&quot;&gt;sold&lt;/a&gt; for Rs1.85bn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To a question about ongoing meetings with a delegation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) over Pakistan’s boycott of the match with India in the T20 World Cup, Naqvi replied, “The issue was Bangladesh’s. We did not want to let their point of view go; they are our brothers and you saw the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Things are happening, which is why I won’t say much, but the ICC and the Bangladesh board are in that phase where if I say anything, it won’t be right. We’ll update you once we receive information,” the PCB chief said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi said that “guests need to be respected” when asked about the attitude of the visiting ICC delegation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walee Technologies is a global company specialising in projects in the media, finance and technology sectors, according to their &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://walee.pk/about-walee/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, which added that the company had also earlier acquired PSL livestreaming rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Multan franchise, started in 2017, competed in eight consecutive editions of the PSL, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1631329&quot;&gt;winning &lt;/a&gt;the league in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last November, the franchise was left &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957302&quot;&gt;ownerless &lt;/a&gt;after the PCB did not extend a renewal offer to owner Ali Khan Tareen. The PCB then announced it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963738&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;take over&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the franchise for the upcoming tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bids were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966930&quot;&gt;invited &lt;/a&gt;on January 14 and their technical evaluation was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970696&quot;&gt;completed &lt;/a&gt;by February 3.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan to play T20 World Cup match against India, govt announces</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The government announced on Monday that Pakistan would play the T20 World Cup match against India, scheduled for February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision to play the match comes after a delegation from the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt; in the country over the weekend and held meetings with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match against India. It also came hours after Sri Lanka urged Pakistan to play India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on X, the government said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was formally briefed by PCB Chairman Naqvi regarding the outcomes of high-level deliberations held between the PCB, representatives of the International Cricket Council (ICC), and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the BCB, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/GovtofPakistan/status/2020922168406835257&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government further noted the statement by BCB President Aminul Islam. The profound gratitude expressed by our brotherly nation is received with great warmth. Pakistan reaffirms that it stands shoulder to shoulder with Bangladesh,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It noted that PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake earlier in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During their warm and friendly conversation, they recalled that Pakistan and Sri Lanka had always stood shoulder to shoulder, especially during challenging times. The Sri Lankan president requested the prime minister to accord serious consideration to amicably resolve the current impasse,” the government said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In view of the outcomes achieved in multilateral discussions, as well as the request of friendly countries, the government of Pakistan hereby directs the Pakistan national cricket team to take the field on February 15, 2026, for its scheduled fixture in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Moreover, this decision has been taken with the aim of protecting the spirit of cricket, and to support the continuity of this global sport in all participating nations,” the government said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The prime minister and the people of Pakistan extend their best wishes to the Men in Green. We remain confident that our team will carry the spirit of sportsmanship and national pride onto the field as they compete for global glory,” the government said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reacting to the post, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said, “Game &lt;em&gt;on hai&lt;/em&gt; (the game is on)!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole nation stands behind the men in green. Great decision by the PM Shehbaz and great diplomacy by PCB chairman,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake, who had called PM Shehbaz earlier in the day, thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As co-host of the tournament, Sri Lanka thanks the ICC and all concerned for their efforts. Sri Lanka hasn’t forgotten the solidarity shown by both India and Pakistan during the 1996 World Cup, when they played in Colombo at a time when others refrained due to security concerns,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Sri Lankan President Dissanayake had urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India. He made the request during a phone call with PM Shehbaz, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan fully supported Sri Lankan cricket during terrorism in Sri Lanka,” he was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan gave priority to its long-standing relations with Sri Lanka above all else, and the Pakistani cricket team continued to tour the country to play cricket despite terrorism,” Dissanayake said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier welcomed the Sri Lankan president’s sentiments and noted how Colombo also stood with Islamabad during difficult times and kept cricket going in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Recently, the Sri Lankan team took an unforgettable step for the Pakistani nation and cricket fans by not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1954722&quot;&gt;cancelling the tour of Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, PM Shehbaz said he would inform the Sri Lankan president about a “final decision” regarding the Pak-India match after consultations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the match against India. In the statement shared by state-run &lt;em&gt;PTV&lt;/em&gt; on X, the BCB expressed gratitude to the PCB and ICC for their “positive roles in trying to overcome recent challenges”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He particularly thanked the PCB, its chairman and cricket fans in Pakistan for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Throughout this period, the PCB has demonstrated exemplary sportsmanship and solidarity,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting BCB President Islam, the statement read, “We are deeply moved by Pakistan’s efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,” Islam added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the ICC said that it would not impose any penalty on the BCB for opting out of the T20 World Cup and also agreed that the country would host an ICC event prior to the 2031 tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the ICC said that it had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; an “open, constructive and congenial dialogue” with PCB and BCB officials, saying that the meeting was not limited to the tournament in India, but the “broader outlook for cricket in South Asia”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While reflecting on the Bangladesh cricket team’s unfortunate absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, the global governing body for cricket reaffirmed BCB’s position as a valued full member, with a proud cricketing history and a vital role in the growth of the global game,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ICC/status/2020916613462229482&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement reiterated the ICC’s continued facilitation of growth in one of cricket’s “most vibrant” markets, with more than 200 million passionate fans, to ensure that Bangladesh’s non-participation in the tournament did not have any long-term effects on cricket in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing the highlights of the dialogue with BCB and PCB officials, the statement said that it reflected “a forward-looking alignment reached in good faith” and was “intended to provide clarity on the current position of the stakeholders”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further mentioned that these outcomes did not “alter, qualify or detract from the ICC’s constitutional autonomy, governance framework or established decision-making processes”, all of which remained fully applicable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governing body added that it was agreed that “no financial, sporting or administrative penalty will be imposed on [the] BCB” in relation to the current matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is acknowledged that BCB retains the right to approach the dispute resolution committee should it choose to do so. This right exists under current ICC regulations and remains intact,” it stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement noted that the ICC’s approach was guided by its principles of neutrality and fairness and reflected the shared objective of facilitative support rather than punishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, all the parties reached an agreement that Bangladesh would host an ICC event prior to the Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2031, “subject to the usual ICC hosting processes, timelines and operational requirements”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This reflects confidence in Bangladesh’s capability as a host and reinforces the ICC’s commitment to providing meaningful hosting opportunities across its membership to develop cricket in the country,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that the governing body, the Pakistani and Bangladeshi boards and other members remained committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity,” the statement read&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC Chief Executive Sanjog Gupta was quoted as saying, “Bangladesh’s absence from the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup is regrettable but it does not alter the ICC’s enduring commitment to Bangladesh as a core cricketing nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our focus continues to be on working closely with key stakeholders, including BCB, to ensure the sport grows sustainably in the country and that future opportunities for its players and fans are strengthened,” Gupta said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further added that Bangladesh remained a priority cricket ecosystem deserving of long-term investment in its development, competitiveness and global integration, and was not defined by short-term disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the government had given &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision had come after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be mentioned that Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan to play T20 World Cup clash against India: state- run media</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-clash-against-india-state-run-media</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has agreed to play the match against India in the T20 World Cup, state-run Pakistan TV reported on Monday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on the social media platform X, the broadcaster said: “Pakistan has agreed to play the T20 World Cup match against India on February 15, following requests from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, with India accepting Pakistan’s preconditions”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development came shortly after Sri Lanka’s President Anura Kumara Dissanayake urged Pakistan to play its T20 World Cup clash against India. He made the request during a phone call with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, according to the Prime Minister’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan fully supported Sri Lankan cricket during terrorism in Sri Lanka,” he was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan gave priority to its long-standing relations with Sri Lanka above all else, and the Pakistani cricket team continued to tour the country to play cricket despite terrorism,” Dissanayake said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier welcomed the Sri Lankan president’s sentiments and noted how Colombo also stood with Islamabad during difficult times and kept cricket going in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Recently, the Sri Lankan team took an unforgettable step for the Pakistani nation and cricket fans by not &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1954722&quot;&gt;cancelling the tour of Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;,” PM Shehbaz was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, PM Shehbaz said he would inform the Sri Lankan president about a “final decision” regarding the Pak-India match after consultations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#bangladesh-cricket-board-thanks-pcb-for-support-urges-them-to-play-match&quot; id=&quot;bangladesh-cricket-board-thanks-pcb-for-support-urges-them-to-play-match&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Bangladesh Cricket Board thanks PCB for support, urges them to play match&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) thanked the PCB for its solidarity, while BCB President Aminul Islam urged Pakistan to play the February 15 match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB expressed gratitude to the PCB and ICC for their “positive roles in trying to overcome recent challenges”, particularly thanking the PCB, its Chairman Mohsin Naqvi and cricket fans in Pakistan for their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Throughout this period, the PCB has demonstrated exemplary sportsmanship and solidarity,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoting BCB President Islam, the statement read, “We are deeply moved by Pakistan’s efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,” Islam added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government had given &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, a delegation from the International Cricket Council (ICC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;arrived&lt;/a&gt; in the country and held meetings with PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi on the team’s participation in the match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The Bangladesh Cricket Board has urged Pakistan to play the scheduled T20 World Cup match against India on February 15, saying it would serve the interests of the global cricket ecosystem. The appeal came after BCB president Aminul Islam Bulbul&apos;s visit to Pakistan, where he praised the PCB for its support and sportsmanship.</description>

      <description>Bangladesh’s election campaign entered its final day on Monday before this week’s vote, with rival parties invoking the 2024 uprising that ended the autocratic rule of Sheikh Hasina.
Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters attended a succession of rival rallies across the sprawling capital Dhaka, as parties sought to harness the legacy of the mass uprising and pitch competing visions of change for the country of 170 million in Thursday’s election.
The South Asian nation will elect a 350-seat...</description>

      <title>Scotland spoil Italy’s T20 World Cup debut with big win</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972064/scotland-spoil-italys-t20-world-cup-debut-with-big-win</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;T20 World Cup debutants Italy had a bruising introduction to cricket’s biggest stage as they suffered a crushing 73-run loss to Scotland on Monday in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland piled up 207-4 with opener George Munsey top-scoring with 84 and in reply, Italy were bowled out for 134 in 16.4 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off-spinner Michael Leask took 4-17 for Scotland, adding to his batting cameo of an unbeaten 22 off five balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A nation better known for its football, Italy are the lowest-ranked side in the 20-team tournament and were making a slice of history here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chasing a mammoth 208 for victory, they suffered early blows before a valiant fourth-wicket partnership of 73 between Australia-born brothers Ben and Harry Manenti kept them afloat at Eden Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CricketScotland/status/2020782307871965359&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Harry departed for 37 and Ben got out after his 31-ball 52 as the Italian batting collapsed from 113-3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Hopefully we’ll sit down at some stage and reflect on that little partnership that we had and it would have been nice to contribute to a win there,” said vice-captain Harry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called playing with his brother “special”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Obviously growing up and playing backyard cricket with him, batting together, and as young kids then dreaming of being at a World Cup batting together and we’ve got to live that out today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Africa-born captain Wayne Madsen could not bat after he dislocated his shoulder while fielding and might miss the rest of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland skipper Richie Berrington said it was vital for them to bounce back after losing their opening match of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Really pleased to get our first win. In the end it was a comprehensive win, but we had to work hard for it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland originally failed to qualify for the World Cup but with only two weeks to go, they replaced Bangladesh, who were kicked out after they refused to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#madsen-heartbreak&quot; id=&quot;madsen-heartbreak&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Madsen heartbreak&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy won the toss and bowled in the Group C encounter, where there were a few Italian fans decked out in the country’s blue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland rode on a 126-run opening stand between Munsey and Michael Jones, who hit 37, to post the highest total in the tournament so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon McMullen with an unbeaten 18-ball 41 and Leask, who hit two fours and two sixes in the last five balls, took Scotland to their best T20 World Cup total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-handed Munsey started briskly with a flurry of fours to unsettle Italy’s attack in the first six overs of the powerplay.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/CricketScotland/status/2020766884057190703&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Italy suffered a blow when Madsen fell awkwardly while trying to stop a boundary in the fourth over and went off the field wincing in pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His shoulder has been put back in place by the physio but he will undergo scans and is “doubtful” for the rest of the tournament, Italy coach John Davison said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The captain still completed an unusual World Cup double on Monday — playing in two different sports for two separate countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He played at the field hockey World Cup for his native South Africa, but holds an Italian passport now through his ancestry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munsey, who was dropped on 40 by Anthony Mosca, reached his fifty in 30 balls with a six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Munsey missed out on a hundred after he holed out to long-on off pace bowler Grant Stewart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He hit 13 fours and two sixes in his 54-ball knock to lead Scotland to their first group win, after they lost their first match to the West Indies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Feb 9 - For years under former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s opposition had little presence on the streets during elections, either boycotting polls or being sidelined by mass arrests of senior leaders. Now, ahead of Thursday’s vote, the roles have reversed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ICC, PCB officials meet in Lahore to discuss Pakistan’s boycotted match with India on Feb 15</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869/icc-pcb-officials-meet-in-lahore-to-discuss-pakistans-boycotted-match-with-india-on-feb-15</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A meeting between the International Cricket Council (ICC) and the Pakistan and Bangladesh cricket boards was held at Lahore’s Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday to discuss Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; the T20 World Cup match with India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting was still in progress until late Sunday night, while the ICC, as well as the two cricket boards, decided not to speak to the media regarding the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a four-hour meeting, no joint declaration was issued. Per sources, there was a break for a late-night dinner, and a second round of talks was scheduled after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) earlier told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that the two sides will most likely announce the outcome of the meeting after receiving an endorsement from the Government of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that the main concern of the PCB expressed during the meeting was related to the “politics rampant at a large-scale level across the ICC affairs and India’s excessive involvement in it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) influence over the ICC decisions was not acceptable to Pakistan, according to a PCB source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They added that the ICC had “nothing to offer to Bangladesh as compensation but to ensure it would get a full share from the ICC earnings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources further said ICC Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja advised the PCB to “move its case before the ICC arbitration committee or bring it up during the ICC board meeting, and end the boycott of the India-Pakistan match forthwith, as it was not good for cricket.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the evening, Khawaja landed in Lahore to meet PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, while Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam also separately arrived to partake in some meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the PCB said the ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Naqvi welcomed Islam at Gaddafi Stadium, where the two held a meeting to discuss the “ongoing crisis”, the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB president thanked Pakistan for its “support” in the T20 World Cup matter.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mir and Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — were also present during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was welcomed earlier at the Lahore airport by Naseer and other officials.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high-level visits come a day after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;ICC Men’s T20 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; commenced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;remained firm&lt;/a&gt; on not taking part in the event after the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969929/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave its cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development, even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC, in a statement, said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup, which should also be the responsibility of all its member,s including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;edged out the Netherlands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Kamindu heroics steer Sri Lanka past Ireland in T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971881/kamindu-heroics-steer-sri-lanka-past-ireland-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s 11th-hour call to draft in Kamindu Mendis proved a masterstroke as the all-rounder produced a match-turning cameo to set up a 20-run win over Ireland in their T20 World Cup opener at Colombo’s R. Premadasa Stadium on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamindu’s blistering 44 off 19 balls with four fours and two sixes gave Sri Lanka the late thrust they badly needed to post 163.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spin trio of Maheesh Theekshana, Wanindu Hasaranga and Dunith Wellalage then ran through the Irish middle order, sharing seven wickets to seal a comfortable victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I just wanted to score a few boundaries and put a partnership with Kusal Mendis,” said Kamindu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Kusal was outstanding today. He deserves a lot of credit. We wanted someone to bat through the innings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They played well during the run chase until the 15th over. We had to keep our calm and we knew they had to take risks and we bowled well towards the end.” Hasaranga claimed three wickets to take his World Cup tally to 40, second only to Bangladesh’s Shakib Al Hasan, who has 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were anxious moments when the leg-spinner, who has a history with hamstring injuries, limped off after his second over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though he returned to complete his quota, he moved gingerly, raising questions over his fitness for the rest of the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s innings had been stuck in first gear until Kamindu strode in with the scoreboard reading 86 for four in the 14th over, boundaries having dried up against Ireland’s spinners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-hander broke a 57-ball boundary drought with a cheeky reverse sweep and then went into overdrive, plundering 21 runs in the 17th over to wrestle back the momentum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Kusal Mendis playing the sheet anchor role in an unbeaten half-century, Sri Lanka found a competitive total from what had looked like a below-par platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ireland were marshalled by left-arm spinner George Dockrell, who returned a miserly spell of 2-17.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 49-run stand between Lorcan Tucker and Harry Tector for the third wicket kept Ireland in the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a promising 105 for two, Ireland lost their way and folded for 143 in 19.5 overs with Matheesha Pathirana cleaning up with two wickets in the final over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They got 15 runs too many,” said Ireland captain Paul Sterling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bit sloppy in the field and we have plenty of work to do before the next game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were confident with plenty of wickets in hand, but Sri Lanka held their nerve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Spin is a challenge for us. It wasn’t coming onto the bat as much as we expected. Spin, I believe, is going to play a big role in this tournament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former champions Sri Lanka are co-hosting the 20-nation showpiece alongside defending champions India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh faces rise in Islamist politics after uprising, says report</title>

      <description>A new report highlights concerns over rising Islamist politics in Bangladesh after the July 2024 uprising. Researchers suggest this shift could negatively affect women and minorities. The analysis indicates a move towards right-wing ideology, with previously suppressed Islamist groups gaining prominence. This transition may introduce formal and informal Islamic governance, posing challenges for women&apos;s rights in the country.</description>

      <title>ICC deputy chair, Bangladesh Cricket Board president land in Lahore; both set to meet Naqvi</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;International Cricket Council (ICC) Deputy Chair Imran Khawaja and Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam separately landed in Lahore on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming Khawaja’s arrival in a post on X, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said the guest will hold a meeting with PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who also serves as the interior minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC official was greeted by Amir Mir, an adviser to the PCB chief, at the Lahore airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to an earlier PCB press release, the BCB president will also meet with Naqvi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was welcomed at the airport by Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chairman — and other officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;remained firm&lt;/a&gt; on not taking part in the event after the International Cricket Council (ICC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969929/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After mulling its stance over the arising situation, Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave its cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the World Cup, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to the development even before the official communication from the PCB, the ICC in a statement said the position of “selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It expressed the hope that the PCB will consider the significant and long-term implications for cricket in its own country as this is likely to impact the global cricket ecosystem, which it is itself a member and beneficiary of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC’s priority remains the successful delivery of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup which should also be the responsibility of all its members including the PCB. It expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution, which protects the interests of all stakeholders,” the ICC stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A government source &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; at the time that Pakistan had refused to play against India to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who had been dropped from the tournament after refusing to play in India, which is one of the co-hosts of the ICC T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government source, the primary reason for boycotting the match with India was the ICC’s “biased decision” towards Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government of Pakistan wanted to show solidarity with Bangladesh. Therefore, as a protest, the national team was restricted from playing its match with India scheduled for February 15,” the source added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970697&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week that ICC had initiated back-channel efforts to resolve the issue and avoid significant financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;edged out the Netherlands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would again &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam on Sunday landed in Lahore and is set to hold multiple meetings, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was welcomed at the airport by Pakistan Super League (PSL) CEO Salman Naseer — also an adviser to the PCB chief — and other officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the PCB press release, Islam will hold a meeting with PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi, who also serves as the interior minister.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Crunch Point For World Cricket: Power Politics And Double Standards Unfairly Rob Bangladesh Of Participation</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/crunch-point-world-cricket-power-politics-and-double-standards-unfairly-rob-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, Bangladesh’s absence from the 10th edition of the T20 World Cup was the result of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/video/game-theory/2026/1/30/aje-onl-bangladesh_v6-1-300126&quot;&gt;the BCCI’s ego and the ICC’s double standards&lt;/a&gt; where power politics and selective decision-making outweighed fairness and sporting integrity. Although many view the Pakistan Cricket Board’s support for Bangladesh positively, in reality it is also a strategic move to counter India for its own strategic benefit. If the match is boycotted, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhakatribune.com/sport/cricket/401784/bangladesh-face-heavy-financial-fallout-after-t20&quot;&gt;Bangladesh will suffer even greater financial and administrative losses. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Controversial remarks in Bangladesh by a politician who questioned women’s ability to perform jobs because of their child-bearing role have caused an uproar ahead of the general election in a country where female workers form the spine of its mainstay garment sector.
Shafiqur Rahman, the chief of the Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami, also ruled out the possibility of a woman assuming the Islamist party’s top post.
In a TV interview, Rahman said women with babies should be given the option of fewer...</description>

      <title>Bangladesh keen on buying rolling stocks</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971817/bangladesh-keen-on-buying-rolling-stocks</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Bangladesh has expressed keen interest in procuring freight wagons and passenger coaches after Pakistan offered the rolling stock at prices cheaper than those in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A two-member delegation, headed by a senior Bangladeshi official, has also visited the Pakistan Railways (PR) carriage factory in Islamabad and the Mughalpura Workshop in Lahore to receive a briefing from the railway authorities and to witness the rolling stock manufacturing process, &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; has learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Lahore-based PR authorities, Mr Farhad Islam, Bangladesh’s Secretary for International Organisations and Consular Affairs and Designate D-8 Commissioner and Mohammad Iqbal Hussain Khan, High Commissioner of Bangladesh to Pakistan, visited the Mughalpura workshop on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Nasir Khalili, Chief Mechanical Engineer (Carriage and Wagons), briefed the delegation on the overall functioning, technical capabilities, and ongoing projects of the PR’s workshops. A short documentary highlighting the workshops’ operational and working strengths was also shown to the guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Railways offers attractive prices to seal export deal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Khalili stated that Pakistan and Bangladesh are brotherly countries sharing a common history, culture, and heritage, and that there exists immense potential for cooperation between the two nations, particularly in the railway sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The delegation was subsequently given a detailed tour of the Mughalpura Locomotive Workshop, where they were briefed on the various stages of locomotive maintenance, rehabilitation, and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The diplomats termed their visit informative, productive, and encouraging, and appreciated the technical expertise and professional competence of Pakistan Railways. “Our visit stands as a clear testament to the strengthening bonds of friendship and cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh,” said Mr Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi has expressed his resolve to advance railway-to-railway cooperation between the two countries, emphasising that such collaboration can yield substantial benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PR is currently supplying coaches and wagons to four countries with broad-gauge rail networks — Sri Lanka, Nepal, Chile and Argentina. ““It reflects that we have achieved modern, indigenous manufacturing capability for coaches and wagons,” the minister said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next phase, according to Mr Khalili, the railway experts from Bangladesh will also visit Pakistan for a detailed technical evaluation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 1980s, Pakistan Railways exported rolling stock to Bangladesh while it provided freight wagons to Sri Lanka in 1999 and 2000 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the current regional context, Pakistan is emerging as a suitable and cost-effective alternative to other international suppliers for Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh was dealing with India regarding the provision of wagons and coaches. But now Dhaka has shown its interest in us for this purpose,” Mr Khalili told Dawn when contacted. He said the delegation also visited the Islamabad carriage factory a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>REGION: A RESURGENT JAMAAT IN BANGLADESH</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971510/region-a-resurgent-jamaat-in-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ramesh Chandra, 44, from Gopalganj district in Bangladesh’s southwest, 127 kilometres from the capital Dhaka, has been making sculptures for over two decades. He is a voter in the Gopalganj-3 constituency, from where former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was elected for eight consecutive terms. Chandra has long supported Hasina’s Awami League.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this time, the situation is different. Following the mass student-led uprising on August 5, 2024, Sheikh Hasina fled to India. On May 10, 2025, the interim government, headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus, banned the political activities of the Awami League and all its affiliates, under the Anti-Terrorism Act. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The International Crimes Tribunal (ICT) in Bangladesh, a domestic judicial body founded by Hasina in 2010, is currently prosecuting Awami League leaders for “genocide” and “crimes against humanity”, related to the 2024 movement. Ironically, the same tribunal sentenced Hasina to death for ordering a crackdown on the 2024 protesters. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Previously, the tribunal had awarded death sentences to several Jamaat-i-Islami leaders for ‘war crimes’ during the 1971 war and supporting Pakistan, resulting in the execution of Jamaat leader Ali Ahsan Mujahid in 2015 and Jamaat chief Motiur Rahman Nizami in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Once banned and vilified in Bangladesh, the Jamaat-i-Islami is now polling neck-and-neck with the country’s mainstream opposition. As the country prepares for its first election since the 2024 uprising, voters disillusioned with corruption are turning to an unexpected alternative…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current government has stated that the Awami League will not be able to resume political activities until the trial is completed. As a result, the Awami League will not participate in the upcoming February 12 elections, the first national polls since the mass uprising. Despite being banned, the Awami League is campaigning against the polls on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When asked if he would be voting this time, Chandra tells Eos, “Why wouldn’t I vote? I will vote and, this time, I will vote for the Jamaat. Everyone has had a chance. This time, Jamaat should be given a chance,” he continues. “Besides, none of them [Jamaat leaders] engage in corruption and extortion,” he claims. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like Chandra, many other voters are now also leaning towards the Jamaat-i-Islami, reflecting a broader electoral transformation sweeping Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A SURGING POLITICAL FORCE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A December survey by the US-based International Republican Institute (IRI) showed 30 percent of voters backing the party of the late former PM Khaleda Zia, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP); 26 percent supporting the Jamaat-i-Islami; and six percent supporting the National Citizen Party (NCP), formed by student activists involved in the August 2024 popular uprising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another mid-January joint poll by Projection BD, IILD, Jagoron Foundation and NarratiV indicates a tighter race, with BNP at 34.7 percent, Jamaat close behind at 33.6 percent and NCP at 7.1 percent. It’s a remarkable turnaround for both the leading parties, whose leaders had been incarcerated and executed and particularly for the Jamaat, which was banned under the Sheikh Hasina regime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts say the Jamaat is competing closely with the BNP due to growing public dissatisfaction with corruption and extortion at the grassroots level, following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. Jamaat has sought to capitalise on this sentiment by presenting itself as a disciplined alternative. Its initiatives, including digital tools to track extortion complaints and monitor government spending, have drawn widespread attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party’s rising popularity among young voters is also evident. According to Election Commission data from November 2025, Bangladesh has around 127.7 million registered voters, including roughly 45 million aged 18 to 35. In recent student union elections at several universities, including Dhaka University, the Jamaat’s student wing, the Islami Chhatra Shibir, won decisively across contested positions, while the BNP-backed Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal failed to secure any significant posts. Many experts believe the student parliament elections could influence the next national polls, though others disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jamaat-i-Islami has formed an 11-party electoral alliance for the upcoming elections, including with the NCP, the student-led party. With the Awami League absent, the BNP and the Jamaat-led coalition are poised to be the main contenders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nahid Islam, convener of the NCP, tells Eos that the alliance is electoral rather than ideological. “Our political views differ from those of Jamaat-i-Islami, but we align on reform, justice and anti-corruption agendas,” he says. “That is why we formed this alliance.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islam is confident that their 11-party coalition will get the votes. “If given the chance to form the government, decisions will be made on common principles and will not be dominated by any single party,” he adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JI chief, or ameer, Dr Shafiqur Rahman tells Eos that his party is receiving “overwhelming support” from across the country, citing independent surveys by, what he termed, credible pollsters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman says that, since the official campaign began on January 22, he has travelled to nearly half of Bangladesh, visiting more than two dozen districts and addressing around 100 public rallies. “At each rally, the crowds were overwhelming,” he says, claiming that large numbers of supporters had turned out in favour of Jamaat candidates. “The country has not witnessed such political euphoria in more than two and a half decades,” believes Dr Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to political analysts, the upcoming election, held after the 2024 popular uprising, could be the most important in the party’s history, with it potentially winning more seats than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, The Washington Post reported that US diplomats were seeking closer engagement with the Jamaat, expecting it to perform strongly. The publication said it has audio recordings that reveal a US diplomat describing the Jamaat as a potential “friend” and stating that it cannot impose Sharia-rule in the country due to Western economic pressure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The prospect of a Jamaat-led government has raised concerns in India, Bangladesh’s largest neighbour and Sheikh Hasina’s longtime ally. New Delhi views the Jamaat as pro-Pakistan, citing the party’s opposition to Bangladesh’s 1971 war that led to the country’s creation and alleged historical ties to Islamabad. Indian officials worry that the Jamaat coming to power could reorient Bangladesh’s traditionally India-friendly foreign policy.&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE QUESTION OF CAPABILITY&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Dr Rahman is confident that his party is ready to govern. “If Allah wills it and the people give us the mandate on February 12, we are ready,” he tells Eos. “Over the past half-century, Jamaat has built a talented and honest pool of leaders, capable of managing every sector.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He recalled the 2001 BNP-Jamaat alliance government, noting that ministers such as Motiur Rahman Nizami and Ali Ahsan Mujahid efficiently managed key portfolios, introduced programmes that boosted employment, utilised taxpayers’ money for development, and rooted out corruption. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Now, after more than 20 years, we are even more confident our leaders will govern effectively across all ministries,” Dr Rahman adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman’s thoughts are echoed by one of his party candidates, lawyer Mohammad Shishir Monir. “I alone am capable of running 10 ministries,” he tells Eos. “We have dozens more in our party like me, who are capable of running the country.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Dhaka University professor and political analyst Dr Mohammad Siddiqur Rahman Khan says that, while Jamaat had some experience in the BNP government from 2001 to 2006, they lack the experience of administration and running the government. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dilara Chowdhury, a former professor and political analyst at Jahangirnagar University, points out that capability and honesty matter more than experience when it comes to running the country. “Currently, Jamaat has more educated and qualified people in its ranks than other parties,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An analysis of candidates’ affidavits by Bengali-language daily Prothom Alo shows that, of the 224 candidates contesting under the JI’s scales symbol, 201 are highly educated, including 10 with PhD degrees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the 287 BNP candidates contesting under the rice sheaf symbol, 229 are highly educated, including eight PhDs. The analysis indicates that the percentage of highly educated and PhD-holding candidates among Jamaat’s ranks is slightly higher than that of the BNP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-i-Islami chief Dr Rahman says the party’s goal is to establish a country based on insaaf [justice], where the majority are not ruled by a chosen few, public wealth is not plundered and no one remains above the law. “Is this not the basic tenet of a model Islamic society?,” he asks. “Is this not the demand of Gen Z, who overthrew a corrupt and fascist regime?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman emphasises that Bangladesh’s multicultural and multi-ethnic population would continue to enjoy equal rights as enshrined in the constitution. “We believe in the rule of law, transparency, accountability, democracy and shura [consultation],” he says. “These principles are already embedded in our constitution and we do not view them as contradictory to Islamic values. You may call it ‘Sharia’ or any other name.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman adds that any elements contradicting Islamic principles would be addressed through parliament, not by force. “Our opponents often use scare tactics, suggesting that ‘Sharia law’ would force women into strict dress codes or deny them education or careers,” he continues. “We have repeatedly clarified that no such measures will be enforced. Women will enjoy equity and fairness in all spheres of life,” Dr Rahman asserts. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party chief also addresses concerns over a Jamaat-led government’s adherence to national laws and UN human rights standards. “As a democratic party that has participated in every election since its inception, no one can deny that Jamaat-i-Islami is committed to the people’s mandate,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman adds that the party sees democratic nations in the West and East as strategic partners and aims to build a stable, pluralistic society based on freedom of expression, rule of law, equity and justice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jamaat chief also points out that, despite attempts by the previous Awami League government to portray the Jamaat as militant, “they were never able to produce a single piece of evidence of Jamaat leaders or workers being involved in terrorism.”&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FROM PARIAH TO CONTENDER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jamaat-i-Islami was founded in 1941 in Lahore, British India, by Islamist scholar Abul Ala Maududi. The party advocates Islam as the foundation for the state and society. During the 1971 war, JI opposed Bangladesh’s independence, and its leaders were accused of collaborating with the Pakistani army and committing war crimes. The party was banned after independence, but the ban was lifted following political changes in 1975, and it returned to politics in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jamaat won 18 seats in the 1991 elections, three in 1996, 17 in 2001, and two in 2008 — a modest to poor showing in previous elections. A high court cancelled the party’s registration in 2013, while JI also boycotted the 2014 elections. In 2018, with the party still declared illegal, some of its candidates ran under BNP tickets while others contested as independents. The party remained ineligible for the 2024 election, with the ban only overturned after Hasina’s ouster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman, its chief, attributes the party’s growing current support to greater public exposure after the student-led July 2024 revolution and wider social media visibility, following decades of what he called “unfair” media portrayal. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Rahman thinks that the party’s suffering under the previous government, including the execution of its leaders and the imprisonment of its members, has earned it public sympathy. Unlike other parties, he claims, the Jamaat has avoided revenge or corruption. Instead, he says, the Jamaat cooperated with the interim government and the judiciary following Hasina’s ouster, demonstrating moral integrity that has won the party public support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts say another key factor is public frustration with corruption and extortion involving BNP leaders and activists, while the Jamaat has relatively avoided such allegations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“People are fed up with BNP leaders and activists because of extortion,” says analyst Dilara Chowdhury. She adds that corruption and extortion lie at the root of most crises in Bangladesh and effective curbs could significantly reduce the country’s problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Khan of Dhaka University says that, with the marginalisation of the Awami League, the Jamaat has emerged as an alternative for some voters. “Public sympathy for the Jamaat has increased to some extent due to repression over the past 15 years,” he tells Eos.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the Jamaat, the BNP is also campaigning on an anti-corruption platform. Speaking at a rally in Chittagong on January 25, BNP Chairman Tarique Rahman said the party would crack down on corruption if elected. Analyst Dilara Chowdhury points out, however, that the public has greater trust in the Jamaat than the BNP on corruption. “During BNP’s time in power from 2001 to 2006, corruption was not reduced. That is why many people do not trust the BNP,” she adds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jamaat has also announced plans to launch a mobile app aimed at tackling extortion. At a recent election rally in Dhaka, Dr Rahman revealed that the app would allow individuals to anonymously file complaints against extortionists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, since August 5, 2024, numerous BNP leaders and activists have been implicated in cases relating to extortion and other allegations. Following media reports, the party expelled several thousand members. On September 18, 2025, BNP chairman Tarique Rahman said organisational action had been taken against more than 7,000 party members in response to various allegations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts also point to internal conflict within BNP, which they say has not been evident within Jamaat. According to an October 2025 report by Dhaka-based Human Rights Support Society (HRSS), at least 85 people were killed and 5,017 were injured in internal BNP clashes between September 2024 and September 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another factor behind the JI’s growing popularity is the party’s charitable activities, including welfare and social assistance programmes. Through disaster relief, financial support for low-income families, and educational and medical assistance, the party has expanded its engagement at the local level. In addition, institutions associated with the Jamaat, including banks, hospitals, coaching centres, schools and colleges, have helped create employment opportunities for party workers and supporters, while also providing education and healthcare services to the wider public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is no surprise, then, that voters such as Gopalganj’s Ramesh Chandra are planning to stamp their vote on the scales symbol in the upcoming elections. But whether the Jamaat can translate polling numbers into actual seats, navigate coalition politics and govern a diverse nation of 170 million remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is certain is that the February 12 elections will reshape Bangladesh’s political landscape in ways unimaginable just 18 months ago — when Hasina still ruled and Jamaat was still fighting for political survival. For a party that opposed the country’s founding, the possibility of now leading it represents perhaps the most dramatic political reversal in Bangladesh’s history.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Shepherd takes hat-trick as West Indies beat Scotland in T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971704/shepherd-takes-hat-trick-as-west-indies-beat-scotland-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pace bowler Romario Shepherd took the first hat-trick of the 2026 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup on Saturday to help the West Indies blow away Scotland’s tail and win by 35 runs in their Group C opener in Kolkata.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shepherd grabbed a sensational four wickets in five balls in the 17th over to put an end to Scotland’s hopes of chasing their target of 183.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shimron Hetmyer’s 36-ball 64 at Eden Gardens earlier propelled the West Indies to 182-5 in their 20 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scots, who only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971513/excited-scots-out-to-prove-they-deserve-last-minute-call-up&quot;&gt;received &lt;/a&gt;a call-up two weeks ago to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replace Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, were threatening a famous victory at 114-3 at the end of the 13th over, with big-hitting captain Richie Berrington and Tom Bruce at the crease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 78-run fourth-wicket partnership between Berrington, who made 42, and Tom Bruce (35) had put them back in the hunt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But strikes by Jason Holder and then Shepherd’s burst saw Scotland bowled out for 147.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Sheppie, he is one of those guys who is willing to learn and improve,” West Indies captain Shai Hope told reporters. “He is always willing to put his hand up, whatever the team requires of him, whether with bat or ball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He is kind of versatile for us in the middle overs, and it’s good to see him starting the tournament with a bang, and hopefully he will continue doing the same.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shepherd removed Matthew Cross, for 11, Michael Leask and Oliver Davidson and celebrated wildly before ending with an impressive 5-20 from his three overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holder finished with figures of 3-30 in 3.5 overs as he wrapped up the Scotland innings in 18.5 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s obviously been great to get a feel for the conditions here,” said Berrington, whose side have a quick turnaround as they face Italy at the same ground on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So I’d say there’s definitely a lot of positives we can take from today. And we need to take that into our next game in a couple of days’ time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#six-hitting-hetmyer&quot; id=&quot;six-hitting-hetmyer&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Six-hitting Hetmyer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scots won the toss and elected to field and initially had the West Indies on the back foot with some disciplined bowling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opener Brandon King made 35 as he cut loose in the seventh over to hit pace bowler Safyaan Sharif for a six and two fours off successive balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland rotated their bowlers and Leask struck the first blow with his off-spin as he bowled Hope for 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King was out next, falling to debutant left-arm spinner Davidson, caught at backward point for his maiden T20 wicket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-handed Hetmyer took on the opposition attack, hitting six sixes in all, and put on a stand of 81 off 37 balls with Rovman Powell, who made 24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetmyer, who was named player of the match, reached his fifty off 22 balls with a six.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Powell was dismissed, but he kept up the attack with fellow left-hander Sherfane Rutherford, who scored a 13-ball 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hetmyer fell to Sharif with Brandon McMullen taking a stunning catch at long-on and Rutherford followed him on the first ball of the next over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Left-arm pace bowler Brad Currie returned figures of 2-23.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PCB denies approaching ICC over Pakistan-India T20 World Cup match</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971692/pcb-denies-approaching-icc-over-pakistan-india-t20-world-cup-match</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) on Saturday denied approaching the International Cricket Council (ICC) in connection with the team’s boycott of the match against India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on the social media platform X, the PCB issued a statement attributed to its spokesperson, Amir Mir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I categorically reject the claim by Indian sports journalist Vikrant Gupta that the PCB approached the ICC,” Mir was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, earlier in the day, had posted on X that the PCB had “reached out to the ICC for dialogue”. He had alleged that after the ICC wrote back to the PCB regarding the legal ramifications it could face, the board approached the cricket world body for talks to resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/vikrantgupta73/status/2020108628850798979&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As usual, sections of the Indian media are busy circulating fiction. A little patience and time will clearly show who actually went knocking and who didn’t,” PCB spokesperson Mir said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheRealPCB/status/2020171907228996078&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that earlier on Saturday, &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; had reported a source close to the developments as saying that the PCB had reached out to the ICC after a formal communication from the cricket world body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC was seeking a resolution through dialogue and not confrontation, the source added, according to &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any clash between arch-rivals India and Pakistan is one of the most lucrative in cricket, worth millions of dollars in broadcast, sponsorship and advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 20-team tournament has been overshadowed by an acrimonious political build-up after Bangladesh, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968499&quot;&gt;refused &lt;/a&gt;to play in India citing security concerns, were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replaced &lt;/a&gt;by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a protest, Pakistan refused to face co-hosts India in their Group A fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/live/t20-worldcup-2026&quot;&gt;edged out Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; in the tournament opener on Saturday, will lose two points if they forfeit the match and also suffer a significant blow to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said this week that his team would travel to Colombo for the clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in global or regional tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;asked &lt;/a&gt;Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the PCB that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, skipper Salman Agha has stated that if Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consult &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;the government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) is in talks with the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to resolve the boycott of its T20 World Cup match against India on February 15, &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; learnt on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>WHO says one person dead from Nipah virus in Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971619/who-says-one-person-dead-from-nipah-virus-in-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization said on Friday that a woman had died in northern Bangladesh in January after contracting the deadly Nipah virus infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case in Bangladesh, where Nipah cases are reported almost every year, follows two Nipah virus cases&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969509&quot;&gt; identified&lt;/a&gt; in neighbouring India, which has already prompted stepped-up airport screenings across Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patient in Bangladesh, aged between 40 and 50 years, developed symptoms consistent with Nipah virus on January 21, including fever and headache followed by hypersalivation, disorientation and convulsion, the WHO added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She died a week later and was confirmed to be infected with the virus a day later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The person had no travel history but had a history of consuming raw date palm sap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All 35 people who had contact with the patient are being monitored and have tested negative for the virus, and no further cases have been detected to date, the WHO said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nipah is an infection that spreads mainly through products contaminated by infected bats, such as fruit. It can be fatal in up to 75 per cent of cases, but it does not spread easily between people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Countries including Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969545&quot;&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; implemented temperature screenings at airports after India said cases of the virus had been found in West Bengal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The WHO said on Friday that the risk of international disease spread is considered low and that it does not recommend any travel or trade restrictions based on current information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, four laboratory-confirmed fatal cases were reported in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently no licensed medicines or vaccines specific for the infection.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Jamaat chief sets sights on premiership after Bangladesh polls</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971535/jamaat-chief-sets-sights-on-premiership-after-bangladesh-polls</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Shafiqur Rahman, the leader of Bangladesh’s largest religious party and prime ministerial hopeful, has contested three elections and lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time, he hopes to finally win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters will head to the polls on Thursday (Feb 12) for the first time since a 2024 uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; Sheikh Hasina, who in her 15 years as prime minister suppressed religious parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, a 67-year-old doctor and preacher, hopes his 11-party alliance could deliver him victory, worrying critics and minorities who fear a Jamaat win could come at their expense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I stand for moral renewal in society,” Rahman vowed in election promises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If successful, the former political prisoner could form the first Jamaat-led government in constitutionally secular Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dressed entirely in white, including a flowing white beard, he cuts a distinctive figure on the campaign trail where his party has put forward only male candidates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Good governance is the foundation of stability, peace and prosperity,” he said, pledging rule-based and corruption-free leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-prime minister Hasina, who is close to India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, went after religious parties and cracked down on extremists, killing scores and arresting hundreds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since her fall, key leaders of parties like the Jamaat have been released from prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Locks’ and brooms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in 1958 in the northeastern district of Moulvibazar, Rahman has been a long-time party activist, running first for parliament in 1996, then again in 2001 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His wife, Ameena Shafiq, is also a doctor, who was selected for one of the seats in parliament reserved for women in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their two daughters and son are also doctors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As party member and then leader, Rahman’s determined push for power has sparked concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh has long been led by powerful women, including Hasina and her long-time rival, the late three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comments Shafiqur Rahman made last year about women’s employment, saying he wanted to encourage stay-at-home mothers, provoked a backlash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t want to lock women at home we don’t have enough money to buy the locks,” he said at a rally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, broom-waving women in Dhaka marched on the streets to symbolically “sweep” him away after a social media post from Rahman had argued women being “pushed out of home in the name of modernity” was “nothing but another form of prostitution”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why Pakistan’s squad at this year’s T20 World Cup feels like a team again</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971449/why-pakistans-squad-at-this-years-t20-world-cup-feels-like-a-team-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Coke Studio released ‘&lt;em&gt;Phir Se Game Uthadein&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; an anthem for the ODI World Cup set to happen the same year. It was inspired by Slogett and Carlone’s 1992 anthem ‘Who Rules the World’&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the soundtrack to Pakistan’s first and most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1720494&quot;&gt;fabled major victory in cricket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produced by Strings and sung by Atif Aslam, the song proclaimed “&lt;em&gt;Jeet ki daastaan, phir ho gi jawaan”&lt;/em&gt; to the same tune as “&lt;em&gt;Who’s gonna be number one, who’s gonna take up the cup?”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a dexterity required to mythologise something that has actually happened — Pakistan has done that with the 1992 World Cup. There must have been a time when the historical immediacy of the victory would lend itself as proof that it was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ever since I can remember, the 1992 World Cup has been a pedestalised peak that seems harder and harder to re-mount as the years go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1992 is invoked in every metaphor for victory in Pakistan, sporting or otherwise. It is the incantation we chant when we are inviting good fortune, and the prayer we use to give shape to this imagined fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look for it every time we’re stuck in a quagmire mid-tournament (which is by and large a yearly occurrence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2015 invocation was no different. The words &lt;em&gt;josh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;junoon&lt;/em&gt; were used, as they always are, those abstract ideals of hope and zeal and valour that never fully lend themselves in translations to other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what was perhaps most intriguing about this remake was the fact that a sad follow-up was shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Pakistan was knocked out by Australia (because, of course), the TV and video advertisements that brandished all colours of waving flags a day before were replaced by clips of an imagined aftermath: hung faces in front of projector screens, the green stars and crescents painted on them going flaccid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empty rooftops with stray, limp pieces of confetti sadly billowing in the breeze. A sadder version of the song, essentially saying “we lost, but it’s okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the reprise that particularly tickled my fancy, but the idea that a company producing a hype song for one of the decade’s most anticipated cricketing events had the foresight to produce a version for the sadder, but probably likelier outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like it came as a shock — the campaign included the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1163765&quot;&gt;routine defeat&lt;/a&gt; to India, the fabled 1-4 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1171788/world-cup-campaign-pakistan-merely-lived-up-to-its-billing#:~:text=A%20150%2Drun%20loss%20to%20an%20equally%20unpredictable%20West%20Indies%20side&quot;&gt;collapse &lt;/a&gt;against the West Indies that the country woke up before dawn to witness, and of course, an immediately historicised dropped catch in the quarter final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that Pakistan losing or ungracefully bowing out of a tournament isn’t necessarily an unfamiliar feeling. It is often anticipated, often met with a begrudging acknowledgement: “&lt;em&gt;haan yaar, pata tha yehi hoga.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, I was thirteen years old during that particular World Cup, and while I do remember all the horrors in technicolour, I cannot help but remember the few gleaming specks of joy that somehow muscled their way out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a then 27-year-old Sarfaraz Ahmed playing perhaps the first iconic knock of his career against South Africa, falling short of a half-century by one run, and Pakistan winning a game that it probably shouldn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan player Sarfraz Ahmed celebrates in a match during the 2015 ICC World Cup. — Reuters/File&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the world, as Wahab Riaz was bowling ball after ball of the spell of his life to Shane Watson, I remember loitering around my school’s staffroom during the quarter final, asking the one teacher who would indulge my classmates and me by giving us an update on the score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each of these trips, we would trundle back to class and take a moment to collectively (mournfully) pray at our desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember realising properly for the first time in my life that all the stretched out, worn out, drawn out cliches about coming back to this team over and over again would be true for my whole life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket feels different now than it did back then — it’s faster and more saturated, with so many more places and people and things involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some form of a “World Cup” every year, and it feels difficult to truly feel what a looming World Cup feels like when one is around the corner every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more recently, the constant uncertainty around cricket has been cause for further disillusionment — a Champions Trophy which was supposed to happen entirely at home &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734&quot;&gt;not having been so&lt;/a&gt;, disappointing showings in 2023 and 2024, and an Asia Cup truncated with political puppet shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into the T20 World Cup, Pakistan is once again at the centre of what looks like a less-than-ideal unfolding: Pakistan has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycotted &lt;/a&gt;the match against India in solidarity with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;against ICC’s inconsistent treatment across teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha addresses a press conference ahead of the ICC Men&amp;rsquo;s T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands, at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 6. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/06202528298086f.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha addresses a press conference ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands, at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 6. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the hybrid-model compromise with India in 2024, which promised neutral venues for both teams in the case of an ICC tournament in either one, Pakistan will be playing its group matches in Colombo, with Sri Lanka being cohosts for the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we have a long history with our good friend Colombo in the rain, and with a fluctuating percentage of rain in the forecast, the possibility of any of Pakistan’s games being washed out is not zero. There is no margin for error. The realistic thing would be to not hope too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, one can’t help but feel like that after a while; the Pakistan side showing up to this World Cup feels like a team again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman Ali Agha’s success at number 3 has unlocked a vein of potential for Pakistan — while his T20 strike rate is around 122, at this position, he has averaged 37 and struck at a solid 168, especially in the recent series against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966516&quot;&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970108&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batting aside, Agha has amassed T20 series wins against South Africa, Australia, West Indies and Bangladesh, in addition to two tri-series wins and leading Pakistan to be the finalists in the Asia Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we speak, Saim Ayub is the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971031&quot;&gt;number one&lt;/a&gt; all-rounder in T20 cricket, and Usman Tariq, with his perfectly legal action, has provided Pakistan’s bowling line-up with a contested but undeniable innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971011/spin-heavy-pakistan-hit-form-but-india-boycott-risks-early-t20-world-cup-exit&quot;&gt;spin arsenal&lt;/a&gt; of Saim, Abrar Ahmed, Usman Tariq, Shadab Khan and Muhammad Nawaz has shaped up to be one of the most promising in the tournament, if the statement 3-0 win against Australia was any indication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All histories up till now have shown that Pakistan’s form before a tournament is just about as untrustworthy as Pakistan’s performances during one — but against all my wisdom, I am compelled to hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, cricket is currently at the mercy of administrative mishaps and Pakistan fans are at the mercy of the Pakistan cricket team. But sometimes it is good to remember that not even the most illustrious of wisdoms and an undeniable breadth of knowledge does not absolve us of this reality: when Pakistan plays cricket, we will be tuning in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this time, the sadder songs will remain in the archives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘Excited’ Scots out to prove they deserve last-minute call-up</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971513/excited-scots-out-to-prove-they-deserve-last-minute-call-up</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;KOLKATA: Scotland spinner Mark Watt said on Friday they were confident of proving they belong at the T20 World Cup, despite only being an eleventh-hour replacement for Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scots failed originally to qualify for the tournament in India and Sri Lanka, but their late call-up will see them face two-time winners the West Indies in Kolkata on Saturday after having only a few days to prepare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh refused to play in India, citing security concerns, and were replaced by the International Cricket Council with Scotland being named as replacement less than two weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a frantic dash to India they will also face England, Italy and Nepal in Group ‘C’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the Richie Berrington-captained team are determined to make the most of the opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I mean, firstly, we’re very sympathetic towards Bangladeshi players, but we still massively believe that we should be here,” veteran left-armer Watt told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We believe that we can beat tea­ms higher ranked than us. So there’s no second guess in our invite into this tournament. We’re all ready to go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scotland will make their fifth consecutive appearance at the T20 World Cup with their best showing in 2021 when they reached the Super 12 stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Scots stunned the West Indies in the 2022 edition and Watt said they can do it again at Eden Gardens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We’re definitely going out there to win,” the 29-year-old said. “We’ve beaten them twice very recently, so I don’t see why we can’t do it again. We’re very confident.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watt said they had received huge support after being parachuted into the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To be honest, if I had to wrap it all up in one word, it’d just be excitement,” he said of the mood in the team camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I mean, how more excited could they be?  They were sitting in their house doing nothing 10 days ago and now they’re in India at a World Cup.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watt added that being fresh and rested could work in Scotland’s favour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You know, we’ve had a great week here in India and sometimes actually having a break from the game is a good thing,” said Watt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Sometimes you can overthink too much about, oh, we’re playing against England, we’re playing against West Indies.” Berrington said it had been a whirlwind couple of weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Obviously it has been unique circumstances,” Berrington told reporters at the captains’ press conference in Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There has been a quick turnaround for us. Our preparations probably looked slightly different to some of the other teams. But I think we have been presen­ted with a great opportunity.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Pakistan, who won the title in 2009, are coming into the tournament in the wake of their decision to boycott the February 15 group game against arch-rivals India in solidarity with Bangladesh, who were replaced by Scotland after refusing to travel to India citing security concerns</description>

      <title>Why Pakistan’s squad at this year’s T20 world Cup feels like a team again</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971449/why-pakistans-squad-at-this-years-t20-world-cup-feels-like-a-team-again</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2015, Coke Studio released ‘&lt;em&gt;Phir Se Game Uthadein&lt;/em&gt;’ &lt;em&gt;—&lt;/em&gt; an anthem for the ODI World Cup set to happen the same year. It was inspired by Slogett and Carlone’s 1992 anthem ‘Who Rules the World’&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the soundtrack to Pakistan’s first and most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1720494&quot;&gt;fabled major victory in cricket&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Produced by Strings and sung by Atif Aslam, the song proclaimed “&lt;em&gt;Jeet ki daastaan, phir ho gi jawaan”&lt;/em&gt; to the same tune as “&lt;em&gt;Who’s gonna be number one, who’s gonna take up the cup?”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a dexterity required to mythologise something that has actually happened — Pakistan has done that with the 1992 World Cup. There must have been a time when the historical immediacy of the victory would lend itself as proof that it was real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But ever since I can remember, the 1992 World Cup has been a pedestalised peak that seems harder and harder to re-mount as the years go by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1992 is invoked in every metaphor for victory in Pakistan, sporting or otherwise. It is the incantation we chant when we are inviting good fortune, and the prayer we use to give shape to this imagined fortune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We look for it every time we’re stuck in a quagmire mid-tournament (which is by and large a yearly occurrence).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2015 invocation was no different. The words &lt;em&gt;josh&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;junoon&lt;/em&gt; were used, as they always are, those abstract ideals of hope and zeal and valour that never fully lend themselves in translations to other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what was perhaps most intriguing about this remake was the fact that a sad follow-up was shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Pakistan was knocked out by Australia (because, of course), the TV and video advertisements that brandished all colours of waving flags a day before were replaced by clips of an imagined aftermath: hung faces in front of projector screens, the green stars and crescents painted on them going flaccid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Empty rooftops with stray, limp pieces of confetti sadly billowing in the breeze. A sadder version of the song, essentially saying “we lost, but it’s okay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not the reprise that particularly tickled my fancy, but the idea that a company producing a hype song for one of the decade’s most anticipated cricketing events had the foresight to produce a version for the sadder, but probably likelier outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s not like it came as a shock — the campaign included the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1163765&quot;&gt;routine defeat&lt;/a&gt; to India, the fabled 1-4 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1171788/world-cup-campaign-pakistan-merely-lived-up-to-its-billing#:~:text=A%20150%2Drun%20loss%20to%20an%20equally%20unpredictable%20West%20Indies%20side&quot;&gt;collapse &lt;/a&gt;against the West Indies that the country woke up before dawn to witness, and of course, an immediately historicised dropped catch in the quarter final.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of this is to say that Pakistan losing or ungracefully bowing out of a tournament isn’t necessarily an unfamiliar feeling. It is often anticipated, often met with a begrudging acknowledgement: “&lt;em&gt;haan yaar, pata tha yehi hoga.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, I was thirteen years old during that particular World Cup, and while I do remember all the horrors in technicolour, I cannot help but remember the few gleaming specks of joy that somehow muscled their way out of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember a then 27-year-old Sarfaraz Ahmed playing perhaps the first iconic knock of his career against South Africa, falling short of a half-century by one run, and Pakistan winning a game that it probably shouldn’t have.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;

        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan player Sarfraz Ahmed celebrates in a match during the 2015 ICC World Cup. — Reuters/File&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Across the world, as Wahab Riaz was bowling ball after ball of the spell of his life to Shane Watson, I remember loitering around my school’s staffroom during the quarter final, asking the one teacher who would indulge my classmates and me by giving us an update on the score.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After each of these trips, we would trundle back to class and take a moment to collectively (mournfully) pray at our desks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I remember realising properly for the first time in my life that all the stretched out, worn out, drawn out cliches about coming back to this team over and over again would be true for my whole life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cricket feels different now than it did back then — it’s faster and more saturated, with so many more places and people and things involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some form of a “World Cup” every year, and it feels difficult to truly feel what a looming World Cup feels like when one is around the corner every month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much more recently, the constant uncertainty around cricket has been cause for further disillusionment — a Champions Trophy which was supposed to happen entirely at home &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734&quot;&gt;not having been so&lt;/a&gt;, disappointing showings in 2023 and 2024, and an Asia Cup truncated with political puppet shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going into the T20 World Cup, Pakistan is once again at the centre of what looks like a less-than-ideal unfolding: Pakistan has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycotted &lt;/a&gt;the match against India in solidarity with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;against ICC’s inconsistent treatment across teams.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha addresses a press conference ahead of the ICC Men&amp;rsquo;s T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands, at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 6. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/06202528298086f.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha addresses a press conference ahead of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup match against the Netherlands, at the Sinhalese Sports Club in Colombo, Sri Lanka on February 6. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of the hybrid-model compromise with India in 2024, which promised neutral venues for both teams in the case of an ICC tournament in either one, Pakistan will be playing its group matches in Colombo, with Sri Lanka being cohosts for the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, we have a long history with our good friend Colombo in the rain, and with a fluctuating percentage of rain in the forecast, the possibility of any of Pakistan’s games being washed out is not zero. There is no margin for error. The realistic thing would be to not hope too much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And yet, one can’t help but feel like that after a while; the Pakistan side showing up to this World Cup feels like a team again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman Ali Agha’s success at number 3 has unlocked a vein of potential for Pakistan — while his T20 strike rate is around 122, at this position, he has averaged 37 and struck at a solid 168, especially in the recent series against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966516&quot;&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970108&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batting aside, Agha has amassed T20 series wins against South Africa, Australia, West Indies and Bangladesh, in addition to two tri-series wins and leading Pakistan to be the finalists in the Asia Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we speak, Saim Ayub is the world’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971031&quot;&gt;number one&lt;/a&gt; all-rounder in T20 cricket, and Usman Tariq, with his perfectly legal action, has provided Pakistan’s bowling line-up with a contested but undeniable innovation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971011/spin-heavy-pakistan-hit-form-but-india-boycott-risks-early-t20-world-cup-exit&quot;&gt;spin arsenal&lt;/a&gt; of Saim, Abrar Ahmed, Usman Tariq, Shadab Khan and Muhammad Nawaz has shaped up to be one of the most promising in the tournament, if the statement 3-0 win against Australia was any indication.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Pakistan&amp;rsquo;s Abrar Ahmed bowls during the second T20 international cricket match between Pakistan and Australia at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on January 31. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/06201901ab69749.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All histories up till now have shown that Pakistan’s form before a tournament is just about as untrustworthy as Pakistan’s performances during one — but against all my wisdom, I am compelled to hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, cricket is currently at the mercy of administrative mishaps and Pakistan fans are at the mercy of the Pakistan cricket team. But sometimes it is good to remember that not even the most illustrious of wisdoms and an undeniable breadth of knowledge does not absolve us of this reality: when Pakistan plays cricket, we will be tuning in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, this time, the sadder songs will remain in the archives.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Captain Salman Agha defends ‘X factor’ Usman Tariq’s bowling action ahead of T20 World Cup opener</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971423/captain-salman-agha-defends-x-factor-usman-tariqs-bowling-action-ahead-of-t20-world-cup-opener</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Agha defended off-spinner Usman Tariq’s unorthodox bowling action on Friday and called him the side’s “X factor” on the eve of their Twenty20 World Cup opener against the Netherlands in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tariq, who has played three T20 Internationals since his debut against South Africa in November, has been reported twice for a suspect bowling action in the Pakistan Super League. His bowling style culminates in him pausing near the crease before firing the ball in with a side-arm sling-shot action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 28-year-old claimed two wickets in his second T20 International, against Australia, and Australia batsman Cameron Green — one of his two victims in that match in Lahore — made a chucking gesture after being dismissed as he made his way off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t understand why we are talking about his action because in my opinion it is a fair action,” Salman told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He has been tested twice and he has been cleared,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think there is no problem in his action. Yes, he is the X factor of the team, and where we feel that we need an X factor, we will definitely use him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having decided to boycott their Group A contest against defending champions India after Bangladesh were excluded from the tournament, Pakistan will have little margin for error in their bid to qualify for the Super 8 stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from India, the group also contains the United States, who stunned Pakistan via the Super Over in the 2024 edition of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman said they would have to be at their best even against second-tier teams like Namibia or the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is very important because you haven’t played much against these sides and you don’t really know their strength and weaknesses,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So it is very, very important to bring your A game, and we as a team only think about how we can execute our plans for 40 overs.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha criticised India&apos;s decision not to shake hands during the Asia Cup and for not travelling to the neighbours for the 2025 Champions Trophy. Ahead of the T20 World Cup, Pakistan&apos;s government announced a boycott of their group stage match against India, citing solidarity with Bangladesh.

      <title>Crisis of neutrality at ICC</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971358/crisis-of-neutrality-at-icc</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;UNLESS you’ve been perpetually asleep since 1947, Pakistan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to play an upcoming T20 World Cup group match against India would come as no surprise. Cricket between India and Pakistan has often been seen as a proxy war, and it used to be that this ‘war’ was played out on the field, with the competition between bat and ball determining victory and defeat. That was then. In recent times, even the selection of venues and itineraries has been weaponised. This is now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could make a convincing case that India started it, and Pakistan has finally had no option but to respond with tit for tat. India’s cricketers haven’t played in Pakistan since 2008, when the Asia Cup was held in Karachi. Over this period, Pakistan has nevertheless played at Indian venues no less than 19 times, the last in November 2023 as part of the ODI World Cup. Initially, India’s refusal could be justified as a matter of safety and security. After all, even Pakistan’s own team was forced to play in the UAE for several years after the Lahore terrorism of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet once Pakistan’s security situation improved and other top-tier teams such as Australia, South Africa, England and New Zealand returned to play at Pakistani venues, India’s cricket board had to fetch another excuse. It came up with the notion of “government permission”, effectively ceding decision-making to the hardline BJP, India’s current ruling party. The mask was finally off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result of this Indian intransigence, Pakistan’s hosting of last year’s Champions Trophy was reduced to a farce. While the rest of the eight-team tournament proceeded happily in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi, India was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1894430&quot;&gt;allowed&lt;/a&gt; to play all five of its matches in Dubai, including a high-voltage group match versus Pakistan on Feb 23 as well as the tournament final on March 9. What explains this extreme asymmetry is India’s clout as a cricketing superpower. With its massive billion-plus audience, India has dominated world cricket through revenues, sponsorships, lobbying and, ultimately, commandeering of the International Cricket Council (ICC), the global body of cricket governance. The situation had become very frustrating for Pakistan to the point that it seemed we had no agency in the matter, no cards left to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two recent dramatic political developments, however, have reset this calculus. One was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;overthrow&lt;/a&gt; of Indian-backed Sheikh Hasina Wajid in Bangladesh, which has ignited a storm of Bangladeshi fury towards its meddling western neighbour. The other was the backfiring adventurism of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908988&quot;&gt;Operation Sindoor&lt;/a&gt;, which has infused Pakistani administrators with a newfound confidence in their posture towards India. The ripples of these two convulsions have now converged in the cricketing world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pure cricketing terms, forfeiting a group match seems a needless own-goal. But a point had to be made, and the PCB did it cleverly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First came Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967562&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to the ICC to have their upcoming World Cup matches shifted outside India to Sri Lanka, a concession that Pakistan had already extracted. Ostensibly triggered by the unexplained expulsion of a Bangladeshi player from an Indian Premier League franchise, Bangladesh’s reluctance to play in India actually reflects worsening political ties. Emboldened by Bangladesh, Pakistan too dug in its heels, announcing ongoing internal deliberations, with a final call on World Cup participation to be made by the Pakistani government on Feb 1. That decision was made public in a tweet: Pakistan would play the World Cup but boycott the group match versus India. The possibility of facing India at a later stage of the tournament was left unaddressed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In pure cricketing terms, forfeiting a group match seems a needless own-goal by the Pakistan Cricket Board, because you are throwing away two valuable points and jeopardising qualification to the next stage. But a point had to be made, and the PCB did it cleverly. Pakistan has a terrible record against India in ICC tournaments, and it is highly likely we would have lost this match anyway. Fortunately, our other three opponents in the group stage are all associate-level teams which, although potentially a banana peel, is no mountain to climb either. Meanwhile, we have deprived the Indian public of its favourite spectacle — thrashing Pakistan at cricket. Simply put, these matches have become television gold for India. The India-Pakistan match in the 2023 ODI World Cup attracted a collective (terrestrial and digital) viewership of over 400 million, and the viewership of last year’s Champions Trophy India-Pakistan match exceeded 800m. The now-defunct encounter of Feb 15 would surely have garnered similar numbers. Should India and Pakistan clash later at the knockout stage, you can be assured all viewership records will be broken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This selective boycott has triggered polite chatter in Pakistani circles while unleashing uproar in India. That tells you how effective it’s been. Indian hardliners are livid and the Indian public is crushed with disappointment. At the same time, some sensible Indian voices have also emerged. Shashi Tharoor, the erudite Indian politician and scholar, has urged India to reach out to Pakistan and Bangladesh under ICC’s umbrella and “call off this nonsense”. Sharda Ugra, a respected Indian cricket journalist, has laid the blame squarely on India’s cricket board, accusing it of petty egoism and institutional failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The real &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;tragedy&lt;/a&gt; in this clutter, apart from cricket itself, is Bangladesh, who have every reason to feel hard done by. The could easily have played their matches in Sri Lanka, following Pakistan’s precedent; yet the ICC threatened them with replacement, and that threat was eventually carried out. This leaves the ICC with a lot to answer for. As an organisation tasked with the welfare of global cricket, it should be a neutral body; instead, it has been reduced to a mouthpiece for India. All cricketing nations need to join forces, take principled stands, and hold the ICC accountable. The costs of doing nothing are simply too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The writer, a professor of neurology at Aga Khan University, has written on cricket for international publications.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>India’s stranglehold on cricket questioned after Pakistan’s show of solidarity with BD</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971308/indias-stranglehold-on-cricket-questioned-after-pakistans-show-of-solidarity-with-bd</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;INDIA’S dominance over world cricket has been evident for nearly two decades, underpinned by its vast population and the commercial power of its domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The launch of the Indian Premier League in 2008 only entrenched that advantage, enabling the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to amass unprecedented financial influence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That influence has seldom been questioned, even when it appeared to undermine competitive balance. The elephant in the room — that international cricket increasingly operates on terms set by India — is no longer being ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy surrounding Pakistan’s decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott&lt;/a&gt; its T20 World Cup group match against India has drawn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970619/principles-before-commercial-interests-cricketers-politicians-react-to-pakistan-boycotting-india-match-in-t20-world-cup&quot;&gt;rare public backing&lt;/a&gt; from senior voices in cricket commentary, who have questioned the International Cricket Council’s consistency and the growing influence of commercial and political considerations on the game.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUSSAIN, ATHERTON FLAG INCONSISTENCY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former England captain Nasser Hussain, speaking on the Sky Cricket Podcast alongside Michael Atherton, said Pakistan and Bangladesh were justified in pushing back against what he described as selective enforcement of ICC rules.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At some stage someone has got to say enough is enough — can we just get back to playing cricket?” Hussain said, arguing that the central issue was consistency rather than politics. He questioned whether the ICC would have adopted a similarly rigid stance had India been unable to travel due to government directives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hussain praised Bangladesh for defending its position after being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;dropped from the tournament&lt;/a&gt; when the ICC declined to relocate its matches from India to Sri Lanka, and described Pakistan’s boycott of the India fixture as a necessary stand against a system increasingly shaped by financial and political power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Atherton echoed those concerns, pointing to previous instances in which India was allowed to play at neutral venues after refusing to tour Pakistan. Denying Bangladesh similar flexibility, he warned, risked undermining the credibility of international cricket’s governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If allowances have been made before, you can’t suddenly decide not to make them now,” Atherton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former England batter Mark Butcher went further, calling Pakistan’s selective boycott a “masterstroke” that exposed the tournament’s financial fragility. By targeting only the India match — the most commercially valuable fixture in world cricket — Butcher said Pakistan had highlighted the extent to which broadcasters, the ICC and co-host India depended on a single contest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole thing rests on that game,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHEHBAZ DEFENDS DECISION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was against this backdrop that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif publicly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971047&quot;&gt;defended&lt;/a&gt; the decision, saying Pakistan would not play the match against India while continuing to participate in the rest of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing a federal cabinet meeting on Wednesday, he said Pakistan stood with Bangladesh and that while sport should remain free of politics, principles of fairness could not be ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bangladesh, the move was welcomed. Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hassan thanked Pakistan for its support, calling it a principled stand against preferential treatment and double standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi also weighed in, urging the ICC to ensure equal treatment of all member boards and arguing that cricket should serve as a bridge when politics divides nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all former players, however, supported the boycott. Former Australia fast bowler Brett Lee said he hoped the match would still go ahead, calling for politics to be kept out of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Let’s get the politics out of it,” Lee said on the Mr Cricket UAE podcast. “I really hope the match happens. The whole world watches when India and Pakistan play one another.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s decision, however, does not come without risk. The ICC has warned of potential long-term consequences for Pakistan cricket, including sanctions, withheld revenue distributions and compensation claims from broadcasters. Some observers question whether the gesture, however principled, adequately accounts for the financial asymmetries that already favour India.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pemra remains ‘headless’ as new chief awaits  PM Office nod</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971340/pemra-remains-headless-as-new-chief-awaits-pm-office-nod</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Even though the country’s electronic media regulator has been without a chairperson since October, a summary for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964833&quot;&gt;appointment&lt;/a&gt; of Ambreen Jan as head of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) has been pending with the Prime Minister’s Office for over a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Jan, a former federal secretary for information, was selected by the parliamentary panel as Pemra chairperson. If her appointment is approved, she will be the first woman to head the authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a reliable source, Ambreen Jan’s confirmation has been held up due to “objections regarding security clearance”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Jan is a former Grade-22 officer and has served as information secretary, the director general of Radio Pakistan and as managing director of PTV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She also served as press counsellor in Bangladesh from 2011 to 2018, when Islamabad-Dhaka ties were under strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was among the five shortlisted candidates considered for the Pemra job, along with retired Brigadier Anwar Ahmed, journalist Mateen Haider, Irfan Ashraf and Dr Hamid Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final shortlist narrowed the choice to three candidates, omitting the names of Irfan Ashraf and Hamid Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under an amendment made to&lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://pemra.gov.pk/assets/uploads/legal/Ordinance_2002.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; Pemra Act,&lt;/a&gt; a parliamentary committee consisting of four members — two each from the National Assembly and the Senate — will recommend a candidate for appointment as head of the regulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Treasury benches and the opposition will have one member each from the National Assembly and the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parliamentary committee finalised and recommended the candidate for appointment by the President over a month ago, but the file is awaiting onward transmission to the Presidency from the Prime Minister’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saleem Baig, the previous Pemra chairman, was also an officer of the Information Group. He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1410839&quot;&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 and reappointed in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Baig retired in September last year after becoming the longest serving head of the Authority. His predecessor, Absar Alam, was removed from the post by the Lahore High Court in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regulator’s mandate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pemra was established under the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://pakistancode.gov.pk/english/UY2FqaJw2-apaUY2Fqa-apaUY2FrbZ8=-sg-jjjjjjjjjjjjj-con-9741&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pemra Ordinance 2002&lt;/a&gt; to facilitate and regulate the private electronic media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has mandate to improve the standards of information, education and entertainment and to facilitate dissemination of information related to current affairs, religious matters, art, culture as well as science and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key segments regulated by Pemra include Direct to Home (DTH) broadcasting, satellite television, landing rights permission (LRP), FM Radio and Cable TV.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Pakistan will seek advice from their government if they reach the knockout phase of the T20 World Cup and meet arch-rivals India, captain Salman Agha said on Thursday.

      <description>In the 18 months since the collapse of Sheikh Hasina&apos;s government, Bangladesh has endured political turmoil but also biting economic pain -- with many hoping for a rebound under new leadership after elections on February 12. FRANCE 24&apos;s Mark Owen speaks with Asif Bin Ali, Geopolitical Analyst and Doctoral Fellow at Georgia State University, who says that the electorate is mainly motivated by the desire for stability and the need for reform.</description>

      <title>T20 World Cup: Sri Lanka urges Pakistan to reconsider boycotting India match</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254/t20-world-cup-sri-lanka-urges-pakistan-to-reconsider-boycotting-india-match</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka’s cricket board on Thursday asked Pakistan to reconsider its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970619&quot;&gt;decision&lt;/a&gt; to boycott their first-round encounter with arch-rival India in the T20 World Cup co-hosted by the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan decided &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;not to play&lt;/a&gt; India on February 15 in Colombo to express solidarity with Bangladesh, who were excluded from the tournament after refusing to play their matches in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade and meet only at global or regional tournament events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any non-participation will have wide-ranging implications, including substantial financial exposure for SLC and the potential loss of anticipated tourism inflows,” the board said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It recalled that Sri Lanka had toured Pakistan to express solidarity and revive international matches there when other nations stayed away due to security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We urge you to take into account the exceptional circumstances, the enduring relationship between our two boards, and the broader interests of the game of cricket,” SLC said, calling on Pakistan to play their scheduled match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India start the T20 World Cup on home soil against the US on Saturday. Pakistan play their first match of the tournament, also on Saturday, in Colombo against the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Pakistan’s boycott of their scheduled match against India on February 15 in Colombo, the arch-rivals may be forced to play each other if they reach the knockout stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Pakistan were to face India in a semi-final or final, they would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240&quot;&gt;consult &lt;/a&gt;the government, skipper Salman Agha said earlier on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan team will seek govt nod if it meets India in T20 World Cup knockout phase: captain Salman Agha</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971240/pakistan-team-will-seek-govt-nod-if-it-meets-india-in-t20-world-cup-knockout-phase-captain-salman-agha</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will seek advice from their government if they reach the knockout phase of the T20 World Cup and meet arch-rivals India, captain Salman Agha said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tournament has been marred by an acrimonious political buildup after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;kicked out&lt;/a&gt; and Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to face co-hosts India in their Group A match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a semi-final or final showdown between the uneasy South Asian neighbours is still a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The India game is not in our control. It was the government’s decision and if we have to play them in the semi-final or the final, we will go back to them and act on their advice,” Agha told reporters in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to play in India, citing security concerns, as relations &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962623&quot;&gt;soured&lt;/a&gt; and were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;kicked out&lt;/a&gt; of Group C by the International Cricket Council (ICC), to be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan backed Bangladesh’s plea to have their games moved to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government in Islamabad cleared the national team to take part but ordered them not to play in the marquee group match against India on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s sad Bangladesh are not here. They have a very good side. Hopefully, they will support us,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and India have not played bilateral cricket for more than a decade, and meet only in multinational events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They will face Namibia, the Netherlands and the United States in the group stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re excited to play in this tournament. We lost to USA in the last World Cup and we are determined to put that disappointment behind us and put a few things right,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will not only lose two points for forfeiting their India match but will also take a big hit to their net run rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even losing one of their group games to bad weather could make it difficult for Pakistan to qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know the margin for error is small, but we can’t control the weather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are here to play good cricket and we’re not bothered about the conditions,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan, the 2009 champions, arrive after a 3-0 whitewash of Australia at home.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve been playing really good cricket. We haven’t lost a series since the Asia Cup last year. Everything is coming along nicely and we’re confident of doing well,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of Pakistan’s games will be played in Sri Lanka, where they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966516&quot;&gt;toured in January&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Very happy to play in Sri Lanka — it’s a second home for me. This is my sixth visit, we know the conditions and we get a lot of support,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav has said that his team would show up in Colombo for their T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan, despite Pakistan boycotting the match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We haven’t said no to playing them (Pakistan),” Yadav told reporters at Mumbai’s Wankhede stadium, where India will begin their campaign against the United States on Saturday’s opening day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are the ones who have said no. Our flights are booked, and we are going to Colombo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India need to be at the stadium and ready to take the field for the February 15 match in order to make sure of being awarded the two points for a match forfeit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The way we have been playing, it looks like we are the favourites,” he smiled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If that seemed like an overconfident statement, the India captain was quick to caution: “There are 19 (other) good teams in the tournament, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On a given day, when you play, you have to bring your A-game and play good cricket.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yadav said no team would be taken lightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m sure every game will be very important,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>UN human rights agency in ‘survival mode’: chief</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971244/un-human-rights-agency-in-survival-mode-chief</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The United Nations human rights chief said on Thursday that his agency was “in survival mode” due to funding shortfalls, as he launched a $400 million appeal to tackle global rights crises in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volker Turk warned countries that at a time when global human rights are under significant assault, his office was facing dire funding shortages hampering its increasingly important and life-saving work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our reporting provides credible information on atrocities and human rights trends at a time when truth is being eroded by disinformation and censorship,” he told diplomats at the UN rights office headquarters in Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a lifeline for the abused, a megaphone for the silenced, and a steadfast ally to those who risk everything to defend the rights of others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, the UN Human Rights Office’s regular budget — set by the UN General Assembly of member states — was $246m, but it ultimately received only $191.5m of that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also sought $500m in voluntary contributions, of which $257.8m came in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funding for the UN’s human rights work has long been chronically underfunded, but Turk said, “We are currently in survival mode, delivering under strain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These cuts and reductions untie perpetrators’ hands everywhere, leaving them to do whatever they please. With crises mounting, we cannot afford a human rights system in crisis,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN human rights office lost around 300 out of 2,000 staff last year and had to end or scale back its work in 17 countries. Its programme in Myanmar, for example, was cut by 60 per cent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#high-impact-low-cost&quot; id=&quot;high-impact-low-cost&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;High impact, low cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, the UN General Assembly approved a regular budget of $224.3m for human rights. However, with the United Nations facing a liquidity crisis, uncertainty remains over how much Turk’s office will receive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights is among a slew of international organisations hit by a global funding crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The United States was the UN’ biggest contributor but has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1895673&quot;&gt;slashed &lt;/a&gt;its funding since President Donald Trump returned to power in January 2025 — while other countries have tightened their belts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UN chief Antonio Guterres &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970287&quot;&gt;warned &lt;/a&gt;last Friday that the world body is on the brink of financial collapse and could run out of cash by July, as he urged countries to pay their dues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, Turk is seeking $400m in voluntary funding from countries and donors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said human rights accounted for a very small slice of overall UN spending but produced “high-impact” results that help to stabilise communities, build trust in institutions and underpin lasting peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The cost of our work is low; the human cost of underinvestment is immeasurable,” he insisted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2025, UN human rights staff working in 87 countries undertook more than 5,000 human rights monitoring missions — down from 11,000 in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That means less evidence for both protection and prevention,” said Turk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#countering-secrecy&quot; id=&quot;countering-secrecy&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Countering secrecy’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving examples of his office’s work, Turk said it supported 67,000 survivors of torture and modern slavery, documented tens of thousands of human rights violations and exposed discrimination in more than 100 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its monitoring mission in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970922&quot;&gt;Ukraine &lt;/a&gt;is the “only organisation” with a comprehensive record of verified civilian casualties “since the initial Russian invasion in 2014”, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Bangladesh, its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1854057&quot;&gt;fact-finding mission&lt;/a&gt; on the 2024 crackdown “helped establish a comprehensive record of systematic and serious human rights abuses”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the probe in the Democratic Republic of Congo “uncovered patterns of grave human rights violations that may amount to crimes against humanity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All this work aims to bring the stories of victims to the world, countering secrecy — the oppressor’s strongest ally — and challenging injustice and impunity,” Turk said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Lahore Qalandars have secured Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman for the 2026 Pakistan Super League season.

      <title>Lahore Qalandars directly sign Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rehman for over Rs60m</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971235/lahore-qalandars-directly-sign-bangladesh-pacer-mustafizur-rehman-for-over-rs60m</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan Super League (PSL) franchise Lahore Qalandars announced on Thursday that it had directly signed Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman for PSL’s 11th edition, spending over Rs60 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our Bangladeshi brother, Mustafizur, picked in 2016 and 2018, is now our direct signing and finally back with the family. Once a Qalandar, always a Qalandar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Amount spent on DS: PKR6.44 crore,” the announcement on Lahore Qalandar’s X account said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/lahoreqalandars/status/2019313875754332331&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965494&quot;&gt;registered&lt;/a&gt; for the PSL in early January, following his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the Indian Premier League (IPL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old left-arm pacer, known for his variations and death-over bowling, was acquired by KKR for INR 9.20 crore in the IPL mini-auction held in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was the only Bangladesh player signed for the season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KKR announced his release after receiving instructions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision came amid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962623&quot;&gt;strained relations&lt;/a&gt; between India and Bangla­desh, linked to reports of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965259&quot;&gt;banned IPL broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; in the country and the Bangladesh Cricket Board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;requested&lt;/a&gt; the International Cricket Council (ICC) to shift its T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC, however, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; the request, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replacing&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh with Scotland in the 20-team tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has played in multiple IPL seasons since 2016 and taken over 60 wickets in the league, previously also featured in the PSL for Lahore Qalandars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur’s direct signing has been made possible after the PCB &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967880&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; sweeping changes to the player acquisition mechanism for PSL 11 last month, replacing the long-running draft with a full-fledged auction and raising the player purse to $1.6m per franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new framework, each franchise is allowed one direct signing of a foreign player who did not feature in the previous season, giving teams an additional avenue to bolster their squads with new international talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PSL 11 will begin on March 26, and will also mark the return of Faisalabad as a host city, expanding the league’s footprint beyond the existing venues of Karachi, Lahore, Multan and Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nipah virus no immediate threat to citizens: AKUH experts</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971067/nipah-virus-no-immediate-threat-to-citizens-akuh-experts</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;KARACHI: While rejecting fears concerning the possible&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969658&quot;&gt; spread&lt;/a&gt; of Nipah virus in Pakistan, experts at a roundtable conference held on Wednesday underscored the need for building healthcare readiness and prioritising implementation of infection control protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were speaking at the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) at a briefing organised to create awareness about epidemiological risks, transmission pathways and prevention strategies related to Nipah virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the experts, the zoonotic virus, which is an infectious agent that jumps from animals to humans, causing disease, currently poses no direct threat to Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of late January, 2026, only two cases involving healthcare workers have been&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969509&quot;&gt; confirmed&lt;/a&gt; in West Bengal, India, and that the risk of international spread is currently categorised as low due to the geographical distance of the outbreak (eastern India, Bangladesh) and the virus’ limited human-to-human transmission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stress need to improve healthcare standards and adopt basic hygiene protocols&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The virus is found in animals but can also affect humans. However, only a handful of cases (of human-to-human transmission) have been reported in recent years globally,” said Dr Faisal Mahmood, Professor, infectious diseases and Associate Chief Medical Officer, AKUH, adding that no case has been reported in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experts explained that the primary mode of Nipah virus transmission is zoonotic, occurring through direct contact with infected bats or the consumption of food, such as raw tree sap or fruit, contaminated by them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The virus is not spread through casual exposure to bats, such as flying nearby. It has a high fatality rate of 40 to 50 per cent but it doesn’t spread as easily as respiratory viruses such as Covid-19,” Dr Mahmood clarified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Dr Nosheen Nasir, Associate Professor and Section Head of Infectious Diseases Department, AKUH, the two cases confirmed in West Bengal, India, were of nurses working at the same hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One of them is recovering while another is reported to be on ventilator support. The authorities there have tested 190 contacts, all of them have tested negative,” she said, adding that no case had been reported from the western region of India that bordered Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to her, cases of Nipah virus infection were first reported in 1998 in Malaysia, where it affected pig farmers. Since then, cases have reported in Bangladesh, India, the Philippines and Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About its clinical manifestation, she said the infection initially presented with flu like symptoms but rapidly progressed to severe brain inflammation, causing neurological problems including fits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to a question about the Nipah cases affecting healthcare workers, the experts agreed that infection control practices were too weak in Pakistan and needed to be implemented strictly that would help address growing threat of all kinds of infectious diseases including HIV and hepatitis C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We don’t need extra wards. We just need to be vigilant, improve our healthcare standards and adopt basic hygiene protocols,” Dr Mahmood said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to concerns over the strong regional presence of the virus and Pakistan’s compromised healthcare services, Dr Nosheen said: “The way the infection presents itself in humans, you can’t hide those cases. Having said that, we need to improve clinical surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The panel acknowledged the government’s proactive screening of travellers at international entry points as a positive step in safeguarding public health. Drawing on lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic nearly six years ago, AKUH experts emphasised that strong health resilience is built through early preparedness, effective coordination, and sustained community awareness, rather than reactive containment alone.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.3800000000000001; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 13px;&quot;&gt;January 2025 marked a significant moment in South Asian diplomacy when Lieutenant General Asim Malik, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/pakistan&quot;&gt;Pakistan’s&lt;/a&gt; intelligence chief, visited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/bangladesh&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style=&quot;line-height: 1.3800000000000001; text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 13px;&quot;&gt;It was the first such trip by the head of Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence, or ISI, since the country’s independence from Pakistan in 1971.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malik arrived in Dhaka via Dubai and was received by Lieutenant General Muhammad Faizur Rahman, the quartermaster general of the Bangladesh army.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit came months after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2024/08/05/asia/bangladesh-prime-minister-residence-stormed-intl&quot;&gt;political ousting&lt;/a&gt; of Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh’s longest-serving prime minister, who was unceremoniously removed by popular revolt in 2024.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The renewed engagement between Dhaka and Islamabad has drawn close scrutiny in New Delhi, where security officials and analysts see echoes of Pakistan’s evolving defence relationship with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/saudi-arabia&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, a partnership that has expanded over time from training and intelligence-sharing into deeper strategic coordination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian analysts warn that if Bangladesh were to follow a similar trajectory, it could complicate &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/india&quot;&gt;India’s&lt;/a&gt; eastern security calculus and undermine New Delhi’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/explained-why-indias-neighbourhood-first-policy-is-about-to-face-its-greatest-test-in-2026-bangladesh-pakistan-and-nepal/articleshow/126232374.cms&quot;&gt;Neighborhood First&lt;/a&gt;” policy at a moment of regional flux.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hasina, who governed Bangladesh for much of the past two decades, was widely viewed in New Delhi as a stabilising force in bilateral relations, particularly for her administration’s cooperation with India on counterterrorism and its refusal to allow Bangladeshi territory to be used for cross-border militancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Why Pakistan&apos;s war with India led to a boom in arms sales and defence ties&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/why-pakistans-war-india-led-boon-arms-sales-and-defence-ties&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her removal from power injected uncertainty into Dhaka’s foreign and security policy, intensifying concerns in India over possible shifts in Bangladesh’s regional alignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/pakistans-isi-chief-visits-dhaka-aims-to-create-intel-sharing-network-with-bangladesh/articleshow/117465352.cms?from=mdr&quot;&gt;The Economic Times&lt;/a&gt;, one of India’s leading newspapers, reported that the ISI chief’s visit was aimed at expanding intelligence cooperation between Pakistan and Bangladesh. “The Indian security officials see the renewed military engagement as gaining momentum after Hasina’s exit, raising concerns in New Delhi about potential implications for India’s internal security and its eastern borders,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robinder Nath Sachdev, an international relations expert and president of the Imagindia Institute, said India’s influence in Bangladesh has weakened amid a seeming shift away from nationalism. He attributes the shift to both an ideological switch and a reaction to Hasina’s former rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have seen a trend in Bangladesh in which identity has shifted from being Bangla first and Muslim second, to one that increasingly emphasises being Muslim first and Bangla second,” Sachdev told Middle East Eye.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Public opinion came to view Sheikh Hasina as acting in an autocratic manner because she was perceived to be supported by India. As a result, opposition to Hasina gradually turned into broader anti-India sentiment.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sachdev says that there&apos;s also a growing perception in Bangladesh that the executions of members of Jamaat-e-Islami by the Hasina government were at the behest of India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Military ties and strategic coordination&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan–Bangladesh engagement has not been confined to just military ties. Civilian exchanges have also increased since 2024, signalling a reset in long-strained bilateral ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In August 2025, Pakistan’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Ishaq Dar, travelled to Dhaka, marking the first foreign ministerial visit from Pakistan in 13 years. Pakistan’s commerce minister, Jam Kamal Khan, also visited Bangladesh to advance trade talks and sign memoranda of understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-advanced-talks-join-saudi-arabia-and-pakistan-defence-pact-report&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;alt&quot; class=&quot;mee-readmore-image&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Pakistan-Saudi-Arabia-leaders-AFP.jpg.webp?itok=YVd7WU5q&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Turkey in &apos;advanced talks&apos; to join Saudi Arabia and Pakistan defence pact: Report&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-advanced-talks-join-saudi-arabia-and-pakistan-defence-pact-report&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that year, the military exchanges intensified, too. In January 2025, Bangladesh sent a high-level military delegation to Pakistan led by Lieutenant General SM Kamrul Hassan, marking one of the most significant defence exchanges between the two countries in years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee, General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, visited Dhaka in October 2025, meeting chief adviser Muhammad Yunus and senior military leaders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in December, reports emerged claiming that Bangladesh and Pakistan were exploring a mutual defence agreement, following the signing of a landmark Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement, between Saudi Arabia and nuclear-armed Pakistan on 17 September 2025 in Riyadh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.news18.com/world/pakistan-bangladesh-move-toward-mutual-defence-agreement-amid-renewed-ties-exclusive-ws-kl-9784864.html&quot;&gt;CNN-News18,&lt;/a&gt; citing a senior source in Pakistan’s foreign ministry, reported that Islamabad and Dhaka had established a joint mechanism to finalise the scope and draft of the proposed agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this year, Pakistan is in advanced negotiations to sell Bangladesh its JF-17 fighter jet, with some reports suggesting as many as 48 units making up the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The initiative reflects growing military-to-military engagement and strategic coordination between the two South Asian nations,” the report said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;Opposition to Hasina gradually turned into broader anti-India sentiment&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Robinder Nath Sachdev,&amp;nbsp;Imagindia Institute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report added that Bangladesh’s military establishment was keen to pursue a strategic and defence pact with Pakistan, similar in scope to Pakistan’s defence cooperation arrangements with Saudi Arabia, and that multiple rounds of discussions had already taken place between senior military officials from both sides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/9/17/saudi-arabia-signs-mutual-defence-pact-with-nuclear-armed-pakistan&quot;&gt;Saudi-Pakistan agreement&lt;/a&gt;, both sides committed that any aggression against one would be treated as aggression against the other, formalising decades of military cooperation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lieutenant General Deependra Singh Hooda, a former general officer commanding-in-chief of the Indian army’s Northern Command, said any formal defence pact between Pakistan and Bangladesh would carry serious implications for the region if it were to materialise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, he expressed skepticism about the likelihood of such an agreement being finalised in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The interim government is unlikely to take such a step with elections approaching,” Hooda told Middle East Eye. “I also do not think all political parties in Bangladesh would support a mutual defence treaty of this nature, which would be seen as directed against India.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Limits of the relationship&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India–Bangladesh relations, Hooda said, are currently strained, pointing to multiple sources of tension, including concerns in New Delhi over the alleged persecution of Hindu minorities in Bangladesh and a recent controversy involving India’s northeastern region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooda was referring to an incident during a visit to Bangladesh by Pakistani and Turkish representatives when caretaker Prime Minister Muhammad Yunus presented them with a map described by Bangladeshis as “Greater Bangladesh”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/northeast-india-under-bangladesh-muhammad-yunus-gift-to-pakistan-general-stirs-row-101761553210333.html&quot;&gt;map&lt;/a&gt; showed India’s seven northeastern states - collectively known as the Seven Sisters - within Bangladesh’s boundaries. The gesture triggered backlash in India, where officials and commentators described it as provocative and insensitive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“To what extent can Pakistan actually come to Bangladesh’s assistance if there is any problem on the India–Bangladesh border?” Hooda said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We need to look at pre-independence Bangladesh. One of the reasons the independence movement began in East Pakistan was the belief that West Pakistan was unable to provide security. The narrative at that time in West Pakistan was that the security of the East lay in the West,” he added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite improving ties, Hooda said, Bangladesh is unlikely to entrust Pakistan with its security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am not sure, looking at it practically, whether Bangladesh is willing to outsource its security to Pakistan in any way,” he said. “Yes, ties are growing. Relations between Bangladesh and Pakistan were in very bad shape and they are now trying to improve them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither Pakistan nor Bangladesh has accepted or dismissed the reports regarding a potential defence agreement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEE contacted Bangladesh’s foreign affairs ministry in Dhaka for comment, but did not receive a response by the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noor Ahmad Baba, a political scientist and former professor at the University of Kashmir, downplayed the possibility of any such deal between Bangladesh and Pakistan. He said that such agreements require a high degree of trust and careful preparation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“For a long time, the two countries did not enjoy a warm relationship. It is only after the removal of Sheikh Hasina&apos;s government that the two have begun expanding areas of cooperation,” Baba said.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pakistans-arms-deals-position-it-squarely-within-growing-saudi-uae-rift&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;alt&quot; class=&quot;mee-readmore-image&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/000_36PB7UK.jpg.webp?itok=W72tC892&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Pakistan&apos;s arms deals position it squarely within growing Saudi-UAE rift&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pakistans-arms-deals-position-it-squarely-within-growing-saudi-uae-rift&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Beyond this, however, the current interim government in Bangladesh cannot enter into major defence agreements that would carry serious long-term strategic implications for the region,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of the current cooling of India–Bangladesh relations, Baba added, Dhaka’s warming ties with Pakistan pose a challenge for Indian diplomacy, particularly at a time when New Delhi is already managing not-so-close relations with several of its neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh have only recently been revived. Signing an agreement similar to the one between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia would be difficult, as it requires a very high level of trust,” Baba said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I believe India will seek to revive its ties with Bangladesh, which is why we saw the Indian Foreign Minister, S Jaishankar, visit Dhaka following the death of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking after his visit to Bangladesh, Indian External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar outlined New Delhi’s neighbourhood policy as one that combines cooperation with firmness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“India supports its neighbours through investment, development assistance and shared growth,” Jaishankar said, while warning that countries that tolerate terrorism “cannot expect the same approach”.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Referring specifically to Bangladesh, he said India’s economic growth benefits the wider region and expressed hope that bilateral ties would strengthen following Bangladesh’s elections.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘There should be no politics in sports’: PM on decision to boycott match against India in T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971047/there-should-be-no-politics-in-sports-pm-on-decision-to-boycott-match-against-india-in-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Commenting on the decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott &lt;/a&gt;the match against India in the T20 World Cup, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday said that there “should be no politics in sports”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the remarks while addressing the federal cabinet in Islamabad. The remarks were televised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have taken a clear stand regarding the T20 World Cup that we will not play the match against India,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There should be no politics in sports,” he said. “We have taken this stand after deliberating on it carefully,” he said, calling it an “appropriate decision”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube_short  media__item--relative&quot;&gt;    &lt;div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should be noted that the government on Sunday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;gave the cricket team the nod&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to participate in the upcoming T20 World Cup 2026, but said the Green Shirts would not play their match with arch-rivals India, scheduled to be held on Feb 15 in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development came after Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;withdrawal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the tournament amid tensions with India, which is one of the co-hosts of the T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of his address, PM Shehbaz began by talking about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970314&quot;&gt;attacks &lt;/a&gt;in Balochistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Within three to four days, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970967&quot;&gt;180 terrorists&lt;/a&gt; were sent to hell,” he said. “As a result, 17 personnel embraced martyrdom. Similarly, 31 civilians were martyred.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that a “heartbreaking incident” took place in Gwadar, where five women and children were martyred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These people (terrorists) are not human,” the premier said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM Shehbaz said that the nation would never forget the sacrifice of security forces and that since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910566&quot;&gt;Marka-i-Haq&lt;/a&gt; — the name for Pakistan’s brief military conflict against India last year — Pakistan’s “hostile eastern neighbour” and other &lt;em&gt;khawarij&lt;/em&gt; were conspiring against the country’s progress and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Khawarij&lt;/em&gt; is a term used by the state to designate members of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“God willing, this will not happen. We will completely eradicate terrorism and Pakistan will find success on the path of progress,” PM Shehbaz vowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the nation should remember how terrorists killed women, children and people who were trying to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a terrible incident and the whole nation is mourning, but it is standing with its law enforcement agencies and the Pakistan armed forces,” the premier added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The day will come when these sacrifices will be worthwhile and the scourge of terrorism will be erased from this country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Switching gears and discussing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970788/trump-warns-of-bad-things-if-no-deal-reached-with-iran&quot;&gt;tensions &lt;/a&gt;in Iran, PM Shehbaz emphasised that Pakistan has played a “brotherly role”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Myself, the deputy prime minister and the field marshal met the Iranian leadership on multiple occasions and we had telephone conversations,” he outlined. “We had several discussions and played our brotherly role as best we could.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier expressed the hope that through dialogue, a peaceful path would emerge leading to regional peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about Kashmir Day on February 5 (tomorrow), PM Shehbaz said that the nation, from Peshawar to Karachi, would express solidarity with freedom movements within the Indian-occupied territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The people will express their passionate devotion to Kashmir in different cities,” the premier said. “I personally will be heading to Azad Kashmir tomorrow and we will convey a message of solidarity on behalf of the whole nation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM Shehbaz then spoke about his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970596/pm-shehbaz-meets-kp-cm-sohail-afridi-in-islamabad&quot;&gt;meeting &lt;/a&gt;with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I called him the day he was elected and assured him that he would have the full support of the Centre, regardless of whatever party he belongs to,” the premier recounted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I told him that Pakistan comes before the party and that he is the chief minister of an important, beautiful province where the people are proud Pakistanis and brave. They have also sacrificed much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier noted that during the 2010 National Finance Commission (NFC) award, Rs800 billion was allocated to KP for counter-terrorism, security and policing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I told him that we gave this money under the NFC, but we have yet to see the results,” he said. “I said that the Safe City project remains incomplete, but he assured me that he intends to complete it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I spoke to him &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970596&quot;&gt;again&lt;/a&gt;, and he mentioned that some payments have been delayed,” the premier added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I immediately tasked [Planning Minister] Ahsan Iqbal, the finance minister and the finance secretary to meet him (KP CM) and, wherever there are delays in payments, to resolve them,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Spin-heavy Pakistan hit form, but India boycott risks early T20 exit</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1971007/spin-heavy-pakistan-hit-form-but-india-boycott-risks-early-t20-exit</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s spin-heavy squad are in winning form ahead of the T20 World Cup, but a controversial decision to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;forfeit&lt;/a&gt; their marquee clash against India could still trigger another early exit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan came close to withdrawing from the tournament in solidarity with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969933&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;, who pulled out after refusing to play in India, citing security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan government eventually cleared the team’s participation but it barred them from facing India in Colombo in a blockbuster clash on February 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With two points for a win, a forfeit of the match will leave Pakistan with no margin for error if they are to progress as one of the top two from a five-team Group A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It means they must win their opening game against the Netherlands in Colombo on Saturday and beat the United States three days later to stay in contention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their final group game will be against Namibia on February 18.&lt;br /&gt;Captain Salman Agha said the move to boycott the India game was out of the team’s hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is not our decision. We have to follow what our government decides,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan government has not said what their stance might be if the team were to end up facing India again in the semi-finals or final. Agha was not thinking about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our job is to win, and we are capable of doing that,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;Pakistan will be keen to avoid a repeat of the last T20 World Cup in 2024, where a shock super over defeat to co-hosts the United States led to them failing to get out of the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The side has since faced criticism for failing to adapt to the modern demands of T20 cricket, with the batting, particularly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969370&quot;&gt;Babar Azam’s low strike rate&lt;/a&gt;, under scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The criticism was fuelled by Pakistan’s record last year, where 21 of their 34 T20 international wins came against lower-ranked opponents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#confidence-restored&quot; id=&quot;confidence-restored&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Confidence restored&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against elite teams, the results were sobering: three losses to India in the Asia Cup and a 4-1 series defeat to New Zealand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Agha believes recent performances have restored confidence.&lt;br /&gt;Pakistan beat South Africa 2-1, won a home tri-series, and then completed a 3-0 sweep of an under-strength Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’ve had good preparation by beating Australia. We have the luxury of quality spinning all-rounders like Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan and Saim Ayub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We’re ticking most boxes and believe we can win the World Cup,” Agha said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spin department has been strengthened by Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, the latter known for his unusual, slingy action and exaggerated pause at the crease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pace attack is led by the experienced Shaheen Shah Afridi and Naseem Shah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faheem Ashraf provides seam-bowling all-round support and newcomer Salman Mirza has been impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Batting remains Pakistan’s most volatile component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan provide strong starts, the side can post competitive totals, but collapses remain a constant threat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head coach Mike Hesson has added another layer of risk by leaving out experienced wicketkeeper Mohammad Rizwan because of poor form, opting instead for makeshift options in Usman Khan, Khawaja Nafay and Farhan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, the ingredients for a deep run are present, but with points potentially forfeited, there is little room left for error.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>That’s not cricket: How ‘creeping Hindutva’ stumped sportsmanship ahead of the T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970764/thats-not-cricket-how-creeping-hindutva-stumped-sportsmanship-ahead-of-the-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1993, a rising star kicked off a legendary Bollywood career with back-to-back megahits in &lt;em&gt;Darr&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Baazigar&lt;/em&gt;, where he introduced audiences to the concept of the ‘anti-hero’. Thirty-three years later, it led to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;Bangladesh being expelled&lt;/a&gt; from a World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this paragraph makes no sense to you, there are some crucial details that need to be unpacked to make this connection clear. But at the heart of this story is one disturbing new reality — international cricket today has become a tool of India’s ruling Hindutva regime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#from-mustafizurs-ouster-to-bangladeshs-expulsion&quot; id=&quot;from-mustafizurs-ouster-to-bangladeshs-expulsion&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From Mustafizur’s ouster to Bangladesh’s expulsion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin with the basic details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 2, a member of India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Sangeet Som, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://indianexpress.com/article/entertainment/bollywood/bjp-leader-calls-shah-rukh-khan-traitor-after-kkr-gets-bangladeshi-player-mustafizur-rahman-for-ipl-10450934/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;attacked India’s most popular Muslim figure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Shahrukh Khan, calling him a traitor. Shahrukh owns the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR), a cricket franchise of the Indian Premier League that had selected Bangladesh cricketer Mustafizur Rahman. Threatening Mustafizur with “dire consequences” and claiming Shahrukh had “no right to live” in India, Som’s calls led to a chorus of hatred against Shahrukh and Mustafizur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within days, the Indian cricket board, the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://sports.ndtv.com/ipl-2026/bcci-asks-kkr-to-release-mustafizur-rahman-amid-bangladesh-ipl-row-10232260&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;BCCI “requested” KKR&lt;/a&gt; to release the player, vaguely citing “recent developments going on all across”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost immediately, Bangladesh’s Sports Adviser &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.prothomalo.com/sports/cricket/k31o80g308&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Asif Nazrul reacted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ordering the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to ask the game’s governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC), to change the venue of their matches in the upcoming T20 World Cup from India to co-host Sri Lanka. Nazrul &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that “if a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India … then the entire Bangladesh team cannot feel safe travelling to India for the World Cup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After several rounds of negotiations between the BCB and the ICC, the latter responded firmly, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235&quot;&gt;rejecting&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh’s request and stating that doing so “could set a precedent that would jeopardise the sanctity of future ICC events and undermine its neutrality as a global governing body”. The apex body kicked Bangladesh out of the tournament and replaced them with Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to that, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi vocally opposed the decision, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;decrying&lt;/a&gt; the ICC’s “double standards.” A few days later, the Government of Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;instructed&lt;/a&gt; its team to boycott its World Cup game against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#ocean-of-vagueness&quot; id=&quot;ocean-of-vagueness&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Ocean of vagueness’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So how is all of this related to India’s ruling Hindutva regime?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For starters, Sangeet Som’s allegations and threats against Shahrukh and Mustafizur were part of the BJP’s standard dog-whistle, anti-Muslim tactics. These particular ones came as part of campaigning for the West Bengal state elections, where KKR play and where the BJP has called for the expulsion of local Muslims by claiming they are Bangladeshi refugees, amongst other bigoted claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This has not been the first time that Shahrukh Khan in particular has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1166984&quot;&gt;come under the religiofascist BJP’s crosshairs&lt;/a&gt;. His decades-long megastardom has meant that the BJP has repeatedly sought to target him as the most iconic Muslim figure in Indian society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was unprecedented however was when the BCCI stepped in and ‘requested’ KKR to remove the player. Journalists in both India and Bangladesh noted that there were no indications of any internal discussion or debate within the BCCI before the decision was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a report in &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/call-on-bangladesh-seamer-mustafizur-rahmans-ipl-ouster-taken-at-top-level-in-bcci-10457349/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Indian Express&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the decision was taken at the highest level in the board, with neither board members nor the league’s governing council involved. An unnamed BCCI official told the paper that “we ourselves got to know about this through the media. There was no discussion. No suggestion was taken from our side.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCCI’s request to KKR was also deliberately vague, avoiding any specifics of the toxic demands that led to the situation, which later allowed the ICC to reject BCB’s claims of security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to veteran Indian cricket journalist Sharda Ugra, this “ocean of vagueness” is a deliberate feature of the Indian board’s recent actions. She noted that despite her best efforts, she never managed to get any formal response on which officials ordered the Indian team to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942168&quot;&gt;refuse shaking hands&lt;/a&gt; with their Pakistani counterparts in the Asia Cup 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, when the Indian team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1871165/pcb-chief-rules-out-hybrid-model-for-champions-trophy&quot;&gt;refused to travel to Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; for the Champions Trophy last year, Ugra said that “there [was] no specific instruction from anyone, no clear cut statement saying … that we have been instructed by the external affairs ministry or the home ministry or the foreign ministry or the prime minister’s office — nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same process seems to have been followed in Mustafizur’s case. As Ugra noted, “There is no evidence of any paperwork, [or] procedure … there’s no document that says … this guy cannot have a contract [or] he’s in danger. No official government warnings. It is just whisperings. That’s all that it seems to have come from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#the-question-of-revenue&quot; id=&quot;the-question-of-revenue&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The question of revenue&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if the BCCI is compromised by India’s ruling party, then the ICC is no different. It is currently run by Jay Shah, the son of Amit Shah, India’s Home Minister and the second-most important figure in the ruling regime after Prime Minister Narendra Modi. As such, its announcement expelling Bangladesh came to be seen as particularly hypocritical, given it had happily conceded to demands to move venues from India for the Champions Trophy in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/jan/26/bangladesh-t20-world-cup-international-cricket-council-icc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;journalist Taha Hashim wrote in &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Guardian&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the ICC’s claim about protecting the “sanctity of future … events is a particularly tragicomic line [given that their] Champions Trophy decision did ‘set a precedent’, forming a hybrid model that has already turned ICC tournaments into a joke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi was the only dissenting voice from other cricket boards, terming the ICC’s actions regarding Bangladesh “double standards” and an “injustice” to the South Asian team, as well as promising action in solidarity. But while it does appear that the fallout with Bangladesh might give Naqvi and the PCB another ally, senior Bangladeshi cricket journalist Mohammad Isam is cautious about such a possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noting the political reality of Bangladesh being surrounded by India on three sides as well as the longstanding cultural links with Bangla-speakers across the border, he said that the options for Bangladeshi cricket were more limited. He pointed out that the current standoff was driven directly by the sports ministry and a government that is about to go into elections in February.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Isam, the expectation amongst observers after Mustafizur’s removal was a diplomatic approach from the board. “[We heard] that the BCB was planning to give a statement that was going to be middle of the ground … because while for this Bangladesh government [opposing] India can be something, but for the cricket board, Indian cricket is the end all. The BCB can’t really afford to fight the BCCI, as one tour from India pays the bills for several years.” Similarly, he mentioned that several voices within Bangladeshi cricket felt that the government’s response had put the ball in India’s court and restricted the BCB’s ability to negotiate a way out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fear of lost revenue is the stick that allows India its undue sway over world cricket. While the PCB and Pakistan cricket have spent almost two decades adjusting to and living with a de facto ban from Indian cricket and its riches, none of the smaller boards have the resources or the clout for such a fight. Crucially, the most economically and politically powerful boards have also shown a complete sense of apathy on this matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sushant Singh, a lecturer at Yale University, wrote in a&lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cricketetal.com/p/mustafissure&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; blog post &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;that “the Mustafizur moment will not be the last time a player is sacrificed at the altar of majoritarian politics … The machinery is now in place, tested and proven effective. And no one — not the ICC, not the boards of other cricket nations, not the global media — has demonstrated the will to stop it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked over an email what would need to happen to resist this tide, he speculated that it “would happen when countries like England and Australia are targeted. That could lead to some kind of a pushback but even then, those boards may decide to lump the humiliation and keep placating the BCCI for the moolah.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#indias-grip-on-international-cricket-finances-governance&quot; id=&quot;indias-grip-on-international-cricket-finances-governance&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;India’s grip on international cricket finances, governance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharda Ugra was similarly unmoved by the potential of any opposition from within the ICC or the two most powerful boards after India. “I’ve been following cricket for 30 years,” she said, adding that “I’ve never seen [the ICC] look this bad — they are an unserious organisation. [And] the Australian and English cricket boards are no more than the sidekicks of the big don in our game. There is no capable, mature leadership in the ICC anymore.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That much maligned ICC leadership appeared to be scrambling in the wake of Pakistan’s decision to solely boycott the game against India — the biggest revenue generator in every tournament. In a statement released before they had even formally been notified of the decision by the PCB itself, the ICC made clear that “it expects the PCB to explore a mutually acceptable resolution”, a much more conciliatory tone than the outright rejection of the BCB’s demands. Clearly, with a huge financial bite to face, the ICC’s priorities have been put to test.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decisions by Bangladesh and Pakistan have been the first time in a long time that the sport has had to address someone else’s concerns other than India’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s vice-like grip over both international cricket’s finances as well as its governance has meant that the entire sport has become increasingly beholden to it. And in turn, the Hindutva movement and the BJP’s control over Indian institutions has meant that as Ugra puts it, the BCCI’s actions are now “addressing voting constituencies rather than cricket fans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has meant that the fallout from campaigning in a local state election in India can lead to massive implications for foreign countries and players, potentially crippling the future of the sport. As one Indian observer &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/arseinho/status/2017981645564100785&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;posted on social media platform X&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “this is what happens if you decide to torch your … one genuine soft power currency to please a few. You can draw a straight line from the Mustafizur decision to [the Pakistan government’s] decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be any quick solution. &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cricketetal.com/p/armageddon-time&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Writing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after the news of Pakistan’s boycott, Sushant Singh said, “[The sport’s] final wicket will fall not to a rival bowler, but to a lawsuit from a broadcaster or the collapse of a commercial deal, leaving the game bankrupt in every sense — financially, morally, and culturally… The only way back is … through accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till then, the reality of the sport is that the flap of a butterfly’s wings in local Indian politics can cause a typhoon in another country’s cricketing fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JPMorgan plans frontier bond index</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1970953/jpmorgan-plans-frontier-bond-index</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Pakistan among top-weighted countries in planned benchmark&lt;br /&gt;• Proposed gauge targets high-yield local bonds in 20-25 economies across Asia, Africa and beyond&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LONDON: JPMorgan is finalising plans for a new index to track frontier market local currency bonds, investors consulted on the details told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, as the bank looks to satisfy a growing appetite for riskier and more diversified high-yield debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move, which comes 15 years after the Wall Street bank launched its hard-currency Next Generation Markets Index (NEXGEM) frontier index, coincides with the year-long &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968175&quot;&gt;slump&lt;/a&gt; in the dollar and some extraordinary recent rallies in markets like Argentina, Ecuador and Uganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment on the plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six leading money managers who spoke to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; on condition of anonymity said the bank’s engagements with them reached an advanced stage in the second half of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The proposed index includes 20 to 25 countries, with Egypt, Vietnam, Kenya, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Pakistan, Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh having the largest “weightings”, three of the managers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bond sizes and caps on weighting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to one source, there would be a limit that means no country has a weighting of more than 8 per cent. A second source said an earlier consultation document had a proposed 10pc limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also set to only include bonds of at least $250 million equivalent, although that has raised issues around Zambia, which many would like to see included but has traditionally only sold smaller individual bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We expect they (JPMorgan) will give us a formal structure for the index around June with the opportunity to make some final comments,” said one senior fund manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are then likely to formally launch the index next year, we think.” Another senior fund manager said the initial announcement might be as early as the end of March, which could also bring the formal launch date forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trillion dollar market FTSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russell has already had an equivalent index since 2021. JPMorgan’s versions, however, are more prominent among emerging market money managers, who effectively use them to compile their funds and measure their performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis by Neuberger Berman estimates tradable local-currency debt has trebled over the last decade to around $1 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also calculates that over the last eight years, frontier market local FX debt had outperformed JPMorgan’s mainstream emerging market local currency index by almost 2.5 percentage points, and also outstripped the EM dollar bond index.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We see that as a confirmation that frontier market growth and general economic performance has been systematically underpriced,” Neuberger Berman’s Rob Drijkoningen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the World Bank, frontier economies are home to a fifth of the world’s population but account for just 3.1pc of global capital flows and less than 5pc of global GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their populations, however, are expected to increase by another 800 million over the next 25 years more than the rest of the world combined — meaning they will play an increasingly important role in global economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect JPMorgan’s new debt index to help expand local currency bond markets — something long-championed by the World Bank and IMF as a way to reduce the number of debt crises caused when currency crashes leave governments unable to pay hard-currency debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zambia and eligibility requirements&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rising interest in frontier market debt also comes as shaken confidence in once-safe debt in the developed world pushes capital flows to other parts of the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three of the investors raised questions about Zambia, which until recently had only sold sub-$250 million local-currency bonds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not in some of JPMorgan’s early outlines, the investors said, but the country has since issued at least one larger bond, raising hopes it will now make the cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One eligibility requirement that mirrors JPMorgan’s GBI-EM index of major emerging economies is that included bonds will have more than 2.5 years of remaining maturity — the time before full repayment is due.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan estimated in September the index will have approximately 400 basis points or more of “pick-up” in yield over the GBI-EM, with over 60pc of the index constituents yielding more than 10pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A potential promotion of top-weighted countries like Egypt and Nigeria to the GBI-EM index in coming years is another issue that could alter the index’s makeup, possibly putting off some investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will be important to nail that down,” one senior fund manager said.&lt;/p&gt;
