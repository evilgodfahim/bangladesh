      <title>Bangladesh in talks with ICC over fate of T20 World Cup games</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965634/bangladesh-in-talks-with-icc-over-fate-of-t20-world-cup-games</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh cricket said on Wednesday it was in talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC) for a “practical” solution to its request to move its T20 World Cup matches out of India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872&quot;&gt;forced&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman to quit the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Saturday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965259&quot;&gt;prompting anger&lt;/a&gt; in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ties tense between the two countries, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;Bangladesh wants&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their World Cup games from India to co-hosts Sri Lanka, citing security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Cup begins on February 7 and Bangladesh are scheduled to play their four group matches in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official Nazmul Abedeen Fahim told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; today that talks were ongoing with the ICC “regarding security issues”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BCB statement said it would “continue constructive engagement with the ICC and relevant event authorities”, seeking an “affable and practical solution that ensures the smooth and successful participation of the team”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB said it was “firmly committed to placing the highest priority on the safety, security and well-being” of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC has not commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh international Mustafizur was snapped up at the IPL auction in December by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964862&quot;&gt;Kolkata Knight Riders&lt;/a&gt; for more than $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he was let go on the Indian cricket board’s “advice” after what it called “recent developments”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations between India and Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957625&quot;&gt;soured&lt;/a&gt; after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.mea.gov.in/media-briefings.htm?dtl/40559/Transcript+of+Weekly+Media+Briefing+by+the+Official+Spokesperson+December+26+2025&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;condemned&lt;/a&gt; what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh police say ex-councillor was behind Hadi’s murder</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965562/bangladesh-police-say-ex-councillor-was-behind-hadis-murder</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Inqilab Moncho spokesperson Sharif Osman Hadi was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928&quot;&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; on the instructions of Taijul Islam Chowdhury Bappi, a former councillor of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) Ward-6, said Shafikul Islam, additional commissioner of the Detective Branch (DB) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bappi is also the organising secretary of the Dhaka City North unit of Jubo League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafikul disclosed the information at a press conference held at the DMP Media Centre this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the DB has submitted a charge sheet against 17 people, including prime accused Faisal Karim Masud, in connection with Hadi’s murder. Of the accused, 12 have already been arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DB official said the investigation revealed that Faisal is a member of the banned Bangladesh Chhatra League and that Hadi was killed in an act of political vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to a question, Shafikul said Faisal and his associate Alamgir Sheikh carried out the killing on Bappi’s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi, an aspiring candidate for Dhaka-8 and a prominent youth leader during last year’s July uprising, was shot in the Paltan area on December 12. He died on December 18 while undergoing treatment in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 14, Inqilab Moncho Member Secretary Abdullah Al Jaber filed an attempted murder case with Paltan Model Police Station against Faisal and several unnamed individuals, which later turned into a murder case. The case was subsequently transferred to the DB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>B’desh police say ex-councillor was behind Hadi’s murder</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965562/bdesh-police-say-ex-councillor-was-behind-hadis-murder</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Inqilab Moncho spokesperson Sharif Osman Hadi was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928&quot;&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; on the instructions of Taijul Islam Chowdhury Bappi, a former councillor of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) Ward-6, said Shafikul Islam, additional commissioner of the Detective Branch (DB) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bappi is also the organising secretary of the Dhaka City North unit of Jubo League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafikul disclosed the information at a press conference held at the DMP Media Centre this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the DB has submitted a charge sheet against 17 people, including prime accused Faisal Karim Masud, in connection with Hadi’s murder. Of the accused, 12 have already been arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DB official said the investigation revealed that Faisal is a member of the banned Bangladesh Chhatra League and that Hadi was killed in an act of political vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Bangladesh’s interim government under economist Muhammad Yunus took office after the collapse of Sheikh Hasina’s long-entrenched regime, it inherited a banking sector on the verge of systemic failure. By mid-2024, officially reported non-performing loans had exceeded 1.7 trillion taka, roughly $15.5 billion, equivalent to nearly 11 percent of total outstanding credit of about $140 [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman registers for PSL following IPL snub</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965471/bangladesh-pacer-mustafizur-rahman-registers-for-psl-following-ipl-snub</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman has registered for the Pakistan Super League (PSL) draft following his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964965&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the Indian Premier League (IPL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old left-arm pacer, known for his variations and death-over bowling, was acquired by Kolkata for INR 9.20 crore in the IPL mini-auction held in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was the only Bangladesh player signed for the season. On Saturday, Kolkata announced his release after receiving instructions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia cited “recent developments” as the reason, without providing further details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision comes amid strained relations between India and Bangladesh, linked to reports of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Bangladesh has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965259&quot;&gt;banned IPL broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; in the country and the Bangladesh Cricket Board has requested the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965099&quot;&gt;ICC to shift&lt;/a&gt; its T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has played in multiple IPL seasons since 2016 and taken over 60 wickets in the league, previously featured in the PSL for Lahore Qalandars. The PSL has confirmed his registration for the upcoming edition, with the draft expected soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Procurement of JF-17 aircraft comes under discussion during meeting between air chief, Bangladeshi counterpart</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452/procurement-of-jf-17-aircraft-comes-under-discussion-during-meeting-between-air-chief-bangladeshi-counterpart</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and Bangladesh’s air chiefs held detailed discussions on the “potential procurement” of JF-17 Thunder aircraft, Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JF-17 Thunder multi-role fighter was jointly developed by China and Pakistan. The fighter has proved its combat capabilities during two military conflicts with India in 2019 and 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press release issued by ISPR said Bangladesh Air Force Air Chief Marshal Hasan Mahmood Khan called on Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu in Islamabad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bangladeshi air chief led a high-level defence delegation during the visit, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The meeting focused on strengthening operational cooperation and institutional synergy, with emphasis on training, capacity building, and collaboration in aerospace advancements,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the press release, the visiting air chief was accorded a guard of honour.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Chief Marshal Sidhu briefed his Bangladeshi counterpart on PAF’s recent advancements and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to supporting Bangladesh Air Force through a comprehensive training framework from basic to advanced flying and specialised courses across PAF institutions, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He also assured fast-tracked delivery of Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, along with a complete training and long-term support ecosystem,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bangladeshi air chief praised PAF’s combat record and expressed interest in benefiting from its operational expertise, seeking assistance in maintenance support for Bangladesh Air Force’s aging fleet and integration of air defence radar systems to enhance air surveillance,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Detailed discussions were also held on the potential procurement of JF-17 Thunder aircraft,” it said, adding that the delegation also visited key PAF facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The visit underscored the strong historical ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh and reflected a shared resolve to deepen defence cooperation and build a long-term strategic partnership,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rs 9.20 cr at stake? Mustafizur set to walk away empty-handed after KKR release</title>

      <description>Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman is unlikely to get paid by Kolkata Knight Riders after his IPL contract termination. Despite being a high-value signing, his release, not due to injury or misconduct, leaves him unprotected by insurance and contractual clauses. This situation highlights player rights issues and potential legal avenues for the bowler.</description>

      <title>Trump’s overplayed hand</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965423/trumps-overplayed-hand</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;IT’S useful to know the lay of the land that Donald Trump sought to breach with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964860&quot;&gt;kidnapping&lt;/a&gt; of Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro. Is there a power vacuum after Maduro’s exit? Evidently not. Will the Bolivarian republic crumble before the firepower of America? Unlikely, in view of the fact that too much Russian, Chinese and Iranian investment has gone into buttressing Bolivarian rule for it to be easily scuttled. Remember that Hugo Chávez was also kidnapped in a coup staged by the CIA. But his people rallied and Chávez returned to lead the country until his mysterious early death. Tariq Ali, in his memoirs, &lt;em&gt;You Can’t Please All&lt;/em&gt; has a chapter on his meetings with Chávez and Maduro. It’s titled “Was Hugo Chávez murdered?” There’s a distinct possibility his cancer was induced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story, however, is about Donald Trump’s fear of Brics and his suspicion of the Bolivarian revolution Chávez launched after his electoral victory in Venezuela in 1998. This has irked the West. In this sense, the story hasn’t really moved forward since the Anglo-American Operation Ajax toppled Mohammad Mosaddegh’s elected government in Iran in 1953. That was about oil. Last week’s kidnapping of Maduro is also about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965198&quot;&gt;oil&lt;/a&gt; even if the Trump administration is rowing back from its claim of running Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What role is Brics playing to worry Trump, so much so that two key Brics members, Iran and Venezuela, are in America’s constant crosshairs? They are both heavily sanctioned countries. With Brics becoming a cohesive financial and economic platform, the hold of sanctions as a tool of US coercion would most likely be rendered ineffective, a key worry for the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chávez’s Bolivarian revolution needs to be understood nicely for a good reason. Chávez leaned heavily on Simón Bolívar’s ideals of Latin American unity, sovereignty, and anti-imperialism. Simón Bolívar was the 19th-century liberator who led South America’s independence from Spain. However, dozens of roads and landmarks in the US and other Western countries are named after Bolívar. Chávez plotted something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don’t know how many Venezuelans were killed. But there was resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nehru inaugurated a Simón Bolívar Road in Delhi’s diplomatic enclave in 1955. Bolívar inspired Nehru’s Non-aligned Movement and Third World solidarity. To the right-wing Narendra Modi government, the road would be an embarrassment. It was evident in the foreign ministry’s tame response to Trump’s attack on a Brics country. “Recent developments in Venezuela are a matter of deep concern. We are closely monitoring the evolving situation.” Thus spake the Brics host for later this year. In neighbouring Bangladesh, people took to the streets to protest the heist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has strong reasons to want to oust the Bolivarian republic. Chávez rewrote the constitution that established new rights, strengthened the executive, and allowed for re-election. Funded by oil revenue, he launched vast social programmes targeting poverty. These included free community healthcare, staffed initially by Cuban doctors; a massive literacy campaign; a mission for subsidised food, housing, and university education. A Qadhafi-like irritant but in the Western hemisphere, a challenge to the Monroe Doctrine.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his adventurous attack on Venezuela, Trump looked like a quack dressed as a handyman assigned the task of staunching America’s slide as a Great Power. His bombing raids on seven nations last year defined his view of Pax Americana. His targets were Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Syria, Nigeria, Somalia and Venezuela. For all that and more, including the supervision of Israeli &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942547&quot;&gt;genocide&lt;/a&gt; of Palestinians, he demanded the Nobel Peace Prize, which &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1947881&quot;&gt;went&lt;/a&gt; instead to a female Venezuelan dissenter who Trump cheered first but has distanced himself from after last week’s removal of Maduro to New York. Seymour Hersh noted that the bombings were inflicted without significant complaint from the Republican-led Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easily the most significant concern for the US is the Venezuelan state taking control of key sectors of oil, telecommunications, electricity, steel, and cement. The constitution is committed to the redistribution of large, unused estates to peasants. Currency and price controls are implemented to combat capital flight and inflation, though they also contributed to economic distortions. Venezuela under Chávez/Maduro pursued Latin American integration outside US influence, promoting the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America and offering subsidised oil for Caribbean nations. The revolution aimed to fundamentally transform Venezuelan society, moving it away from the neoliberal, two-party system that had dominated since 1958 and towards a model of ‘21st century socialism’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As usual, the news about the dangerous military intervention was used to highlight American intelligence and military prowess instead. Stories were circulated about the derring-do of the elite Delta Force commandos who seized Maduro and his wife by bombing their way into his heavily guarded palace. However, Cuba is mourning the death of 32 Cuban guards who were protecting the first family. They were killed in the air and ground mission. We don’t know how many Vene­zuelans were killed. But there was resistance, and that resistance is believed to be the signal for a rehearsed plan to turn a swoop on Venezuelan resources into a nightmare for Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensing the resistance, Trump threatened Venezuela’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, with the fate of her president. Tapped to take control of the country after Maduro’s removal to the US, Rodríguez has claimed that the operation to arrest him had a “Zionist tinge”. She warned that “the extremists who have promoted armed aggression against our country — history and justice will make them pay”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What role could Israel have played in the assault on a distant country? Not very different from the role that Iran has as a strategic ally of Bolivarian Venezuela. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar was quick to congratulate Trump, saying the US “acted as the leader of the free world”. But Trump’s ties with Israel have split his MAGA base. As he struggles to keep his majority in both Houses of Congress in polls due in November, Trump may have overplayed his hand in using the military to fix runaway domestic challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>287 died after abduction during Hasina era, says commission</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965377/287-died-after-abduction-during-hasina-era-says-commission</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: A Bangladesh commission investigating disappearances during the rule of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina said Monday at least 287 people were assumed to have been killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commission said some corpses were believed to have been dumped in rivers, including the Buriganga in the capital, Dhaka, or buried in mass graves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government-appointed commission, formed after a mass uprising in August 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; Hasina, said it had investigated 1,569 cases of abductions, with 287 of the victims presumed dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have identified several unmarked graves in several places where the bodies were presumably buried,” Nur Khan Liton, a commission member, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The commission has recommended that Bangladesh seek cooperation from forensic experts to identify the bodies and collect and preserve DNA samples from family members.” In its final report, submitted to the government on Sunday, the commission said that security forces had acted under the command of Hasina and her top officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report said many of those abducted had belonged to the country’s largest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, or the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), both in opposition to Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a separate investigation, police in December began exhuming a mass grave in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan, China call for more ‘visible, verifiable’ actions to eliminate terrorist groups based in Afghanistan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and China issued a joint communique on Monday calling for more “visible and verifiable” actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan, and prevent them from using Kabul’s territory for militancy against any other country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement came after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965195/pakistan-china-reaffirm-bond-amid-regional-tensions&quot;&gt;conclusion&lt;/a&gt; of the 7th round of the Pakistan-China Foreign Mini­sters’ Strategic Dialogue, for which Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar travelled to Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two sides called for more visible and verifiable actions to dismantle and eliminate all terrorist organisations based in Afghanistan which continue to pose serious threats to regional and global security, and prevent terrorist organisations from using the Afghan territory for terrorism against any other country and to endanger any other country,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two sides agreed to keep in close communication and coordination on the Afghan issue, work with the international community to encourage the Afghan government to build an inclusive political framework, adopt moderate policies, focus on development, pursue good-neighbourliness, and play a constructive role in helping Afghanistan achieve stable development and integrate into the international community,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement also said that China commended the measures taken by Islamabad to combat terrorism and protect the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“China fully recognised the significant contributions and huge sacrifices that Pakistan made in combating terrorism over the years,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two sides reiterated their commitment to combating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations with zero tolerance, and agreed to further deepen all-round cooperation on counter-terrorism and security, and make concerted efforts to ensure that the China-Pakistan Belt and Road cooperation advances in a secure and smooth manner,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Calling on the international community to strengthen counter-terrorism cooperation, the two sides expressed their firm opposition to double standards on counterterrorism,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both countries also expressed the readiness to continue leveraging the China-Afghanistan-Pakistan trilateral foreign ministers’ dialogue and the China-Bangladesh-Pakistan cooperation mechanism to “deliver new outcomes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#pak-china-agree-to-enhance-communication&quot; id=&quot;pak-china-agree-to-enhance-communication&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pak-China agree to enhance communication&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the communique, during the dialogue in Beijing, the two sides engaged in a “thorough exchange of views on bilateral relations and cooperation in wide-ranging areas, including strategic and political cooperation, as well as cooperation on defence and security, economy, trade, investment, and cultural and people-to-people exchanges”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and China “agreed to enhance strategic communication, deepen strategic mutual trust, jointly safeguard their common interests, promote the economic and social development of the two countries,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also called for the safeguarding and advancing “peace, development and prosperity of the region and beyond”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and China also marked the 75th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, with the launch of commemorative activities, the communique said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that the anniversary was an “opportunity to consolidate China-Pakistan friendship and expand new areas of cooperation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan also congratulated China on the “successful conclusion of the 14th Five-Year Plan and the upcoming 15th Five-Year Plan” under the leadership of Chinese President Xi Jinping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan also lauded China for its “people-centred development philosophy”, the communique said, adding that Pakistan also believed that the “Chinese path to modernisation provided a new option and practical solution for other developing countries to achieve independent development”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China also commended Pakistani leadership on “leading the country to achieve macroeconomic stability and to lay a solid foundation for national economic growth centred on Pakistan’s National Economic Transformation Plan (2024-2029) (URAAN Pakistan) and for its people to share the fruits of development and prosperity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan also reiterated its “firm commitment” to the one-China principle, stating that Taiwan is an “inalienable part of China’s territory”, the communique said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan firmly supports every effort of China to achieve national reunification, and opposes any form of ‘Taiwan independence‘ and any attempt to create ’two Chinas’ or ’one China, one Taiwan,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also added that “Pakistan firmly supports China on the issues concerning Xinjiang, Xizang, Hong Kong and the South China Sea”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement further added that China also “reiterated its steadfast support for Pakistan in safeguarding its sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China also renewed its commitment to supporting Pakistan in “pursuing a development path suited to its national conditions and achieving economic prosperity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The country also vowed to support “Pakistan in firmly combating terrorism and playing a bigger role in international and regional affairs”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#upgraded-version-of-cpec&quot; id=&quot;upgraded-version-of-cpec&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Upgraded version of CPEC’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communique further said that the two sides also reached an agreement to “build an upgraded version 2.0” of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They agreed to “further align their development plans and priorities”, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the communique, the two nations outlined three key sectors: industry, agriculture, and mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also called for pushing for the “building and operation of the Gwadar Port, smooth passage of the Karakoram Highway, and enhancing Pakistan’s capacity for sustainable development”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two nations pledged to “deepen cooperation in areas such as trade and investment, information technology, science and technology, cybersecurity, technical and vocational training and education, and people-to-people and cultural exchanges”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the course of the dialogue, it was also decided that the two countries will “take the year-round opening of the Khunjerab Pass as an opportunity to deepen two-way trade and people-to-people exchanges”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also agreed to “welcome third-party participation in CPEC cooperation that conforms with the modalities set by China and Pakistan”, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two countries also agreed to strengthen bilateral cooperation in the financial and banking sectors, including extending mutual support at regional and international multilateral financial forums, the communique added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan appreciated China for providing support for its fiscal and financial sectors,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On their cooperation in the field of space, the two sides “expressed satisfaction at their expanding space cooperation and for the expected early entrance of Pakistani astronauts into the China Space Station”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They agreed to explore space in a peaceful and mutually beneficial manner for greater economic and social development and prosperity,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, China &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1952137&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; it was going to arrange for a Pakistani astronaut to perform short-term missions as part of China’s space station missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two sides also reaffirmed their commitment towards upholding UN principles and international law, vowing to “oppose the plotted resurgence of fascism and militarism”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They expressed “support for the postwar international order underpinned by international legal documents such as the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Proclamation and other principles of international law for the maintenance of world peace and security, and protect historical truth and international justice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also underscored the significance of a South Asian “regional order underpinned by the UN Charter, international law, and the basic norms governing international relations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and China also reiterated their “opposition to any unilateral actions, and reaffirmed the significance of maintaining peace and stability in South Asia and the necessity of resolving all outstanding disputes through dialogue and consultation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the dialogue, Pakistan informed China of the latest developments in occupied Kashmir, with the latter reiterating that the dispute should be resolved “properly and peacefully in accordance with the UN Charter, relevant UN Security Council resolutions and bilateral agreements”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the communique, the two countries “expressed readiness to conduct trans-boundary water resources cooperation under the principle of equality and mutual benefit”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also “emphasised the imperative of fulfilling international legal obligations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that the “significance of the maintenance of international and regional security and stability was reiterated”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and China also “reaffirmed their readiness to further enhance cooperation under the frameworks of the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, the Global Civilisation Initiative and the Global Governance Initiative”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two sides reaffirmed their commitment towards making the “global governance system more just and equitable, and join hands to build a community with a shared future for humanity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan highly commended China’s efforts to safeguard developing countries’ right to sustainable development,” the joint communique said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two sides expressed satisfaction over their cooperation within multilateral mechanisms such as the UN and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO),” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that note, they agreed to “deepen coordination and collaboration to safeguard the common interests of developing countries and international fairness and justice”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and China also renewed their “commitment to the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, their support for multilateralism and free trade, and their opposition to hegemonism, bullying behaviours violating national sovereignty of other countries, the forming of ‘small circles’ and bloc confrontation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The communique said that China commended Pakistan on its “outstanding performance during its UN Security Council presidency”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also voiced “full support for Pakistan to work as the rotating president of the SCO from 2026 to 2027”, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the issue of Palestine, Pakistan and China called for an “unconditional, comprehensive and permanent ceasefire in Gaza” and stressed the significance of the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two countries called for the “implementation of the two-state solution with the establishment of an independent state of Palestine”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two sides also expressed their concern at the situation in the occupied West Bank, and urged the need for urgently addressing it,” the communique said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that Pakistan and China also “expressed willingness to work with the international community to make unremitting efforts for peace and stability in the Middle East”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, Dar thanked his counterpart for the “warm hospitality accorded to him and his delegation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two sides agreed to hold the next round of Foreign Ministers’ Strategic Dialogue in Islamabad next year on mutually convenient dates,” the communique concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his visit to Beijing, the foreign minister also met with a delegation from China Minmetals Corporation (MCC) led by its Vice President Xu Jiqing, the FO said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FO said that the pair “held productive discussions on MCC’s ongoing and upcoming projects in Pakistan”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, Dar reaffirmed “Pakistan’s strong support for MCC in advancing mining investment and promoting value-added industrial development”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Opposition leader’s appointment: PTI chief whip submits documents pertaining to Omar Ayub’s cases to NA speaker</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965254/opposition-leaders-appointment-pti-chief-whip-submits-documents-pertaining-to-omar-ayubs-cases-to-na-speaker</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PTI Chief Whip Amir Dogar, shared with National Assembly (NA) Speaker Ayaz Sadiq on Monday documents pertaining to the withdrawal of cases concerning PTI’s Omar Ayub and again demanded Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party Chairperson Mehmood Khan Achakzai’s appointment as the opposition leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes around a month after the NA Secretariat sent a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959934&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt; to Dogar, seeking details about the status of cases concerning Ayub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The letter said the provision of the details in writing is necessary for the completion of the process for the appointment of an opposition leader in the lower house of Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NAofPakistan/status/2008122399464821086&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a post on the NA’s X account, Dogar presented the documents to Sadiq today, and the two also exchanged views on matters related to the appointment of the opposition leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogar “once again” demanded that the Achakzai be appointed as the opposition leader, the post said, adding that Ayaz gave the assurance that “everything will be done in accordance with the law and the constitution”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement further quoted Ayaz as saying that he would share information with the house on the matter at the next NA session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The process for the appointment of the opposition leader will be initiated afresh,” he said, adding that the rules of the NA regarding the appointment of the opposition leader were clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post of the opposition leader in the NA has been vacant since the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1928901&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;disqualification&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in August last year by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in connection with his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1927802&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;conviction&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the May 9 cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same month, incarcerated PTI founder Imran Khan had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1932053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;nominated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Achakzai for the post of opposition leader and despite the PTI‘s insistence for his appointment, his notification remains pending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Ayub had challenged his disqualification in the Supreme Court (SC). But, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951715&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;withdrew his plea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For his part, Sadiq had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1953709&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;maintained&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; regarding the delay in the appointment of a new opposition leader that the matter was “sub judice” — apparently a reference to Ayub’s appeal against his disqualification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its letter to Dogar last month, the NA Secretariat stated that the opposition had mentioned in Parliament that Ayub’s cases were not sub judice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“However, this fact was not conveyed to the secretariat in writing,” the letter said, requesting that the current status of the cases in which the secretariat had been made a party be communicated to it in writing for the completion of the “prescribed process of the declaration of leader of the opposition in the National Assembly”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#no-formal-contact-for-talks&quot; id=&quot;no-formal-contact-for-talks&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘No formal contact for talks’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, NA Speaker Sadiq said that the opposition had not yet made formal contact for initiating talks with the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the remarks while speaking to the media, according to a handout issued by the NA Secretariat. It quoted him as saying that the “opposition had not yet made any formal contact to initiate a dialogue”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My role in the talks is only that of a facilitator,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadiq further stated that the committee system in the lower house of Parliament was fully functional as per constitutional requirements, adding that he was “completely independent” in his position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the topic of the appointment of the NA opposition leader, Sadiq said that four letters had been sent to the opposition’s chief whip in this regard. He said that after the fourth &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964060&quot;&gt;letter&lt;/a&gt;, the opposition had submitted a certified copy of their decision.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The constitutional process for the appointment of the next opposition leader will be initiated in the next parliamentary session,” Sadiq said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the process will move forward “after checking and verification of the signatures of the opposition members”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had reiterated his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962792&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;offer for talks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, at a recent national conference organised by the Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayin-i-Pakistan (TTAP) opposition alliance, participants had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962585/door-to-talks-must-never-be-shut-ttap&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;agreed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the door for dialogue must never be closed in a democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day, political leaders from across the spectrum, including stalwarts from the ruling PML-N, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962581/pml-n-stalwarts-back-call-for-political-dialogue&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;called for dialogue and restraint&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to achieve stability in the country, saying that political confrontation was causing instability and violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the PTI later said that it would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963000/?utm_source=newskit_ai&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;not engage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in negotiations with the federal government, with the party’s Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram saying the stance was taken following the instructions of party founder Imran Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, Prime Minister’s Adviser on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964485&quot;&gt;stated&lt;/a&gt; that “confidence-building measures” between five major players in the country would improve the overall political situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The speaker also recalled his recent visit to Bangladesh for the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt; funeral &lt;/a&gt;of the former prime minister of the country, Khaleda Zia. Sadiq and India’s External Affairs Minister Subrah­manyam Jaishankar had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964410&quot;&gt;shaken hands&lt;/a&gt; during the visit, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Pakistani delegation received an unusually warm welcome from the people of Bangladesh,” Sadiq said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the Indian minister “came to greet him and shook his hand”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadiq recalled that he also met with the country’s interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, terming the meeting “pleasant”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the two “reached an agreement for the promotion of parliamentary and public relations” between the two countries during the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further said that “he will always remember the love he received from the people of Bangladesh”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;He further said that “he will always remember the love he received from the people of Bangladesh”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later in the day, the opposition’s chief whip in the NA, Amir Dogar, in a meeting with Sadiq, once again demanded the appointment of Mehmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also submitted documents regarding the withdrawal of cases against PTI leader Omar Ayub to him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Ayub’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1928901&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;disqualification&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), the seat of the opposition leader in the lower house has been vacant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a press statement issued by the NA Secretariat today, the two “exchanged views on matters related to the appointment of the opposition leader”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, Dogar submitted documents regarding the withdrawal of cases against the disqualified opposition leader Ayub, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogar “once again” demanded that the Achakzai should be appointed as the opposition leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August last year, the incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1932053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;nominated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Achakzai for the post of opposition leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response to Dogar’s request, the NA speaker said that everything “will be done in accordance with the law and the constitution”, adding that he would apprise the House of the matter in the next session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that “a fresh process for the appointment of the opposition leader will be initiated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadiq maintained that “the rules of the NA regarding the appointment of the opposition leader are clear”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh orders indefinite ban on IPL telecast after Mustafizur Rahman row</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965259/bangladesh-orders-indefinite-ban-on-ipl-telecast-after-mustafizur-rahman-row</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh government on Monday ordered an indefinite ban on the telecast and promotion of the Indian Premier League (IPL) following the controversy surrounding the removal of Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes after KKR said on Saturday they had released the Bangladesh bowler after being told to do so by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh are scheduled to play three T20 World Cup matches in Kolkata next month, with the February 7-March 8 tournament being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said after an emergency meeting that it had “formally requested” the International Cricket Council (ICC)&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt; shift its team’s games to Sri Lanka&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A statement from the ministry of information and broadcasting said that it had “noted that no reason was communicated for the decision behind Mustafizur Rahman’s exclusion [from the IPL]” and that the development had “caused distress among the people of Bangladesh”, &lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this context, a decision has been taken regarding the broadcast of IPL matches,” the statement said, adding that the decision had been taken “in public interest”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was signed by the ministry’s assistant secretary Firoz Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no logical reason for this decision of the Indian Cricket Board and such a decision has distressed, shocked and angered the people of Bangladesh,” the government statement further said, according to &lt;em&gt;India Today&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A request has been made to stop the promotion/broadcast of all games and events of the Indian Premier League (IPL) until further orders,” the statement added. &lt;br /&gt;TV channels and streaming platforms have broadcast the IPL in Bangladesh since its inception in 2008, according to &lt;em&gt;ESPN Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the first time that the Bangladesh government has banned the telecast of an international cricket tournament, anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCB President Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters late on Saturday: “The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#worsened-relations-between-india-bangladesh&quot; id=&quot;worsened-relations-between-india-bangladesh&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Worsened relations between India, Bangladesh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developments come against the backdrop of soured political relations between India and Bangladesh after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;toppled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1880793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;allowed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; India to play Champions Trophy matches in the United Arab Emirates due to sour relations with hosts Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will also play all their matches of the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, as part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, cricket news site &lt;em&gt;Cricbuzz&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/137127/bcb-to-approach-icc-on-t20-wc-security-after-mustafizurs-ipl-omission-cricbuzzcom&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the BCB would ask the BCCI for a formal explanation regarding Mustafizur’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; requests for comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Mustafizur Rahman was bought by KKR for Rs 9.20 crore at the auction last month, a move that underlined his value in T20 cricket. However, the franchise later released him following directives from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) amid political tensions related to minority issues in Bangladesh.</description>

      <title>Do Not Allow Politics To Colonise Our Shared Games</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/do-not-allow-politics-colonise-our-shared-games</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;When cricket is weaponized against Bangladesh while India’s own internal challenges are ignored, the message is unmistakable: power, not principle, is guiding moral judgment. This undermines the very spirit of &lt;em&gt;Neighborhood First&lt;/em&gt;, which depends on trust and even‑handedness. Over time, such practices erode confidence, deepen asymmetry, and weaken the foundations of cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh will not play T20 World Cup matches in India, decision taken in context of BCCI’s ‘extreme communal policy’</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will not play their T20 World Cup matches in India after its cricketer Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolkata Knight Riders said on Saturday they had released the Bangladesh bowler after being told to do so by India’s cricket board (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh are scheduled to play three T20 World Cup matches in Kolkata next month, with the February 7-March 8 tournament being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), after an emergency meeting on Sunday, said it had “formally requested” the International Cricket Council (ICC) shift its team’s games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Board of Directors resolved that the Bangladesh National Team will not travel to India for the tournament under the current conditions,” a BCB statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said its decision was made due to “growing concerns regarding the safety and security” of its players, and based on its government’s advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In light of this decision, the BCB has formally requested the International Cricket Council (ICC), as the event authority, to consider relocating all of Bangladesh’s matches to a venue outside India.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the BCB’s emergency meeting, Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul said, “We welcome this decision taken in the context of the extreme communal policy of India’s cricket board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Nazrul had &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bssnews.net/news/347627&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “We will not accept any insult to Bangladeshi cricket, cricketers and Bangladesh under any circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The days of slavery are over,” he had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he had ordered the BCB to inform the ICC that “where a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India despite being contracted, the entire Bangladeshi cricket team cannot feel safe going to play in the World Cup”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he would also ask that the IPL be blocked from Bangladeshi broadcasters. “I have requested the information and broadcasting adviser to stop the broadcasting of the IPL tournament in Bangladesh,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolkata Knight Riders, majority-owned by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, subsequently said that Mustafizur’s “release has been carried out following due process and consultations”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCB President Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters late on Saturday: “The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developments come against the backdrop of soured political relations between India and Bangladesh after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;toppled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1880793&quot;&gt;allowed&lt;/a&gt; India to play Champions Trophy matches in the United Arab Emirates due to sour relations with hosts Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will also play all their matches of the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, as part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, cricket news site &lt;em&gt;Cricbuzz&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/137127/bcb-to-approach-icc-on-t20-wc-security-after-mustafizurs-ipl-omission-cricbuzzcom&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the BCB would ask the BCCI for a formal explanation regarding Mustafizur’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh will not go to India to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has taken this decision today,” Nazrul, who is an adviser to the Ministry of Sports, said in a statement after an emergency meeting of the BCB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We welcome this decision taken in the context of the extreme communal policy of India’s cricket board.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On December 18, 2025, a 25-year-old Hindu garment worker was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962420/massive-crowd-attends-funeral-of-bangladesh-student-leader#:~:text=the%20violence%20this%20week%20also%20saw%20a%20Hindu%20garment%20worker%20killed%20following%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy&quot;&gt;lynched&lt;/a&gt; by a mob of approximately 150 people in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district. Following accusations of blasphemy, the victim was beaten to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mob lynchings in Bangladesh, known locally as &lt;em&gt;gono-pituni&lt;/em&gt;, have a long history. But this crisis is not unique to Bangladesh. According to the Human Rights Watch’s &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Report 2025&lt;/a&gt;, South Asia has emerged as a global epicentre for collective vigilantism, with similar violence frequently reported in India and Pakistan as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent surge in mob violence across India, Bangladesh and Pakistan is propelled by similar drivers: a decaying public confidence in the judiciary and the rapid spread of digital disinformation. This combination allows ‘street justice’ to effectively supersede state authority. As American political scientist Paul Staniland observed in a 2020 analysis for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, these patterns in South Asia are not recent developments. They are historical continuities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooted in colonial-era structures and galvanised by the 1947 partition of India, this culture of vigilantism has simply been recalibrated for the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Bangladesh to India and Pakistan, lynchings have become a grim substitute for justice, but South Asia’s mobs are not simply spontaneous eruptions of rage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1326729&quot;&gt;lynching&lt;/a&gt; of university student Mashal Khan in Mardan, Pakistan, serves as a grim illustration of how false allegations (circulated on social media) are weaponised to orchestrate violence. Targeted by a campus mob under the guise of blasphemy, Mashal was brutally murdered, and his death was filmed by mobile phones and then uploaded on social media sites. The plan of the attack was hatched by university staff and Mashal’s political rivals who wanted to silence his criticism of administrative corruption in the university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tragedy highlights a broader historical pattern in South Asia, where the mob has evolved into a calculated tool for political mobilisation and social policing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last century, the psychological mechanisms of ‘mob mentality’ have become deeply integrated into the region’s sociopolitical terrain. Mob mentality is driven by a psychological phenomenon known as ‘deindividuation’, where individuals lose their ‘sense of self’ and personal identity within a large group. When a person becomes part of an energised crowd, they often experience a feeling of anonymity. They believe they are indistinguishable from those around them and feel shielded from personal recognition or judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the individual perceives their actions as being shared by the collective, the weight of personal accountability is diminished. Deindividuation often overrides a person’s moral compass, pushing individuals to engage in behaviours they are likely to find unthinkable if they were acting alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that individuals in ‘collectivist societies’, where group harmony is prioritised over individual identity, may be more susceptible to participate in or cheer mob violence. According to a 2023 study by Chinese researchers Jingjing Jio and Jun Zhao, people in collectivist cultures are conditioned from birth to subordinate their personal identity to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the transition from being an individual actor to becoming part of a collective mass is fluid, allowing personal moral standards to be easily overwhelmed by a crowd’s passions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about China? It is a collectivist society, like most South Asian cultures. But mob violence in China is rare. While China saw significant mob activity in the 1960s and 1970s, the Chinese state (especially after 1989) has maintained a strict monopoly on force through its policy of ‘&lt;em&gt;weiwen&lt;/em&gt; [stability maintenance].’ Unauthorised gatherings, even if they are pro-government, are swiftly dismantled. All forms of mob action are perceived as a threat to the state’s authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divergence between South Asia and China regarding mob violence lies in the nature of the ‘moral trigger.’ In South Asia, religious anxieties, such as allegations of blasphemy (Pakistan, Bangladesh) or disputes over cow slaughter (India), serve as ‘sacred’ justifications that allow a crowd to emotionally and morally bypass legal frameworks. In contrast, China’s secular and strictly regulated environment lacks these sacred pretexts, making it far more difficult to ignite the emotional frenzy required for a lynching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/695984db0630f.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital dynamics further separate these two regions. South Asia grapples with viral, unregulated disinformation that facilitates rapid mobilisation, whereas China’s heavily monitored digital space prevents the formation of frenzied mobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within China’s one-party system, capitalist growth has birthed a lifestyle individualism which, while not political, acts as a buffer against the more destructive elements of rigid groupthink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But capitalism in South Asia has not catalysed a similar shift toward individualism. Instead, economic power remains deeply intertwined with collectivist traditions. For example, business communities and traders often provide significant financial support to both mainstream and radical religious groups that are often at the forefront of fomenting mob violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a feedback loop, where economic success reinforces traditional group identities rather than diluting them, maintaining the collective as the primary unit of social and political life. The Indian historian Meera Nanda has brilliantly investigated this in her book The God Market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individualism functions as a psychological safeguard, anchoring the person to their internal moral convictions. By prioritising personal integrity over collective impulse, the individual becomes resilient to deindividuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While capitalism and individualism are historically symbiotic, this synergy faces resistance in South Asia, despite the expansion of capitalism in the region. Here, individualism is often stigmatised as a threat to communal harmony. Consequently, while Western discourse frames individuality/ self-reliance as a hallmark of ‘maturity’, South Asian cultural paradigms frequently interpret personal autonomy as a form of egoism or a betrayal of domestic duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, as capitalism expands across South Asia, the burgeoning middle class is cultivating what the Indian psychologist Jai B. P. Sinha terms “localised individualism”. This model does not abandon communal ties but strategically renegotiates them, to serve personal and economic advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this shift is unlikely to curb the region’s propensity for mob violence nor neutralise the moral triggers behind lynchings. Rather than dismantling the moral narratives that incite such behaviour, South Asian middle classes have co-opted these narratives through populist movements, to protect their own socio-economic and political standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution requires a two-pronged approach: the cultivation of a more robust individualism and a decisive shift in state policy. The government must treat all mob activity as a direct challenge to state sovereignty and respond with appropriate force. Furthermore, the state must actively deconstruct and reframe the moral rationales that serve as triggers for collective violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, these remedies are more feasible in Pakistan’s pragmatic-centrist hybrid regime than in its neighbouring states. In India, a populist Hindu-nationalist government often relies on these very triggers for political mobilisation, while Bangladesh remains in a state of flux, struggling to navigate the volatile transition from autocracy to democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘Days of slavery are over’: Bangladesh to demand its T20 World Cup matches be moved outside India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/days-of-slavery-are-over-bangladesh-to-demand-its-t20-world-cup-matches-be-moved-outside-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will request their matches at next month’s T20 World Cup be played in Sri Lanka, after India forced a Bangladeshi player to quit the Indian Premier League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will not accept any insult to Bangladeshi cricket, cricketers and Bangladesh under any circumstances,” said Asif Nazrul, Youth and Sports Adviser in the interim government, in a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bssnews.net/news/347627&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; carried by the state-run &lt;em&gt;BSS&lt;/em&gt; news agency Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The days of slavery are over,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman was on Saturday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; by the Kolkata Knight Riders after the Indian Premier League (IPL) team were “advised” by Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to do so, following tensions between the neighbouring nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he had ordered the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to write to the International Cricket Council (ICC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board should inform that, where a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India despite being contracted, the entire Bangladeshi cricket team cannot feel safe going to play in the World Cup,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have also instructed the board to request that Bangladesh’s World Cup matches should be held in Sri Lanka.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T20 World Cup begins on February 7, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh are scheduled to play their four group matches in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka, part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations between India and Bangladesh soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCB president Aminul Islam Bulbul said the board will hold an emergency meeting later on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind”, he told reporters late Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2026 IPL season begins on March 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he would also ask that the IPL be blocked from Bangladeshi broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have requested the Information and Broadcasting Adviser to stop the broadcasting of the IPL tournament in Bangladesh,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolkata, majority-owned by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, subsequently said that Mustafizur’s “release has been carried out following due process and consultations”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Mindless politicising of sport’: Tharoor slams Mustafizur Rahman’s IPL exit</title>

      <description>Sharing a video from Friday, Tharoor made his position clear on the issue. &quot;Recalling my views on the subject, now that BCCI has deplorably pulled the plug on Mustafizur Rahman,&quot; he said. He then questioned the logic behind the move, adding: &quot;And what if the Bangladeshi player in question had been Litton Das or Soumya Sarkar?&quot;</description>

      <title>BCCI instructs Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh’s Mustafizur after pressure from BJP</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indian Premier League (IPL) team Kolkata Knight Riders have been told to release fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia said on Saturday, amid growing tensions between the countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sangeet Som’s criticed Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise, calling Khan a traitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur’s selection to play for KKR had come amid allegations mostly by the Indian right-wing over attacks on Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, hundreds protested near Bangladesh’s High Commission in New Delhi after Hindu factory worker Dipu Chandra Das was beaten and set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district by a crowd that accused him of making derogatory remarks about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 12 people were arrested in connection with his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to recent developments going on all across, the BCCI has instructed the franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release one of their players, Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, from their squad,” Saikia &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://aninews.in/news/sports/cricket/kkr-confirms-exclusion-of-mustafizur-rahman-from-squad-after-bcci-directive20260103134705/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Indian news agency &lt;em&gt;ANI&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They can ask for a replacement if needed. And upon request, BCCI will allow a replacement player.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“BCCI will allow Kolkata Knight Riders a replacement player in line with IPL regulations, and further details will be communicated in due course,” the team added in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; has approached Mustafizur for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, 30, has played for Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals in previous seasons of the IPL, taking 65 wickets in 60 matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964862/shahrukh-khan-gets-flak-over-bangladesh-cricketer-in-kolkata-knight-riders&quot;&gt;signed by Kolkata&lt;/a&gt; in last month’s auction for a fee of 92 million Indian rupees ($1.02 million), making him the most expensive player from Bangladesh in IPL history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt;, opposition Congress party on Thursday condemned Som’s criticism of Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While calling Khan a “gaddar” (traitor), former Uttar Pradesh MLA Som questioned him for investing money in a player “from a country working against India”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt; quoted from a video clip of him as saying: “The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite all this, traitors like Shahrukh Khan, I’m calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shahrukh that they will not succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident worsened relations between India and its neighbour, with ties already strained after Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;fled to New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1847298&quot;&gt;protests against her&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 19th edition of the IPL begins on March 26, after India and Sri Lanka co-host the Twenty20 World Cup starting in February.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shahrukh Khan gets flak over Bangladesh cricketer in Kolkata Knight Riders</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964862/shahrukh-khan-gets-flak-over-bangladesh-cricketer-in-kolkata-knight-riders</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI: Political tensions between India and Bangladesh spilled into the cricket field after Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan recently inducted Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman into his Indian Premier League (IPL) team Kolkata Knight Riders and a Hindutva politician called him a traitor, reports said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt;, opposition Congress party on Thursday condemned Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sangeet Som’s criticism of Shahrukh for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Uttar Pradesh MLA, Som targeted Shahrukh and called him a “gaddar” (traitor) for backing the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not unusual for the popular actor, who happens to be a Muslim. In fact, the Muslim movie star triumvirate of Sharukh, Salman Khan and Amir Khan have all faced allegations that they were anti-Hindu, pro-Pakistan or whatever else BJP supporters choose to call them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the late acting legend Dilip Kumar was also not spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mustafizur controversy erupted following the IPL 2026 auction, where KKR secured “The Fizz” for a staggering Rs92 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the move was seen as a tactical masterstroke by cricket analysts, it also waded into a nationalistic backlash underway amid diplomatic tensions between India and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy over Mustafizur being in Shahrukh’s team is nicely timed with domestic election season in West Bengal where the BJP is threatening to topple secular Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in polls due by mid-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur’s selection to play for KKR has come amid allegations mostly by the Indian right-wing over attacks on Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While calling Shahrukh a traitor, Som questioned him for investing money in a player “from a country working against India”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt; quoted from a video clip of him as saying: “The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite all this, traitors like Shahrukh Khan, I’m calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shahrukh that they will not succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress MP Manickam Tagore, strongly condemning the ‘traitor’ remarks, called the comments an “attack on India’s pluralism” while saying that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) should stop “poisoning society”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Som was adamant. “Rahman won’t be able to step outside the airport,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>South Asia&amp;#039;s Youth Bulge Risks Becoming Long-Term Liability</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/south-asias-youth-bulge-risks-becoming-long-term-liability</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;South Asia’s unemployment challenge is unfolding differently across different regional countries, yet driven by almost similar structural failures. India’s scale magnifies the risks of jobless growth; Pakistan’s instability deepens youth disillusionment; Sri Lanka’s educated unemployment reflects long-standing policy neglect; and Bangladesh’s export-led success masks limited employment diversification. Unless these states move beyond fragmented schemes and adopt employment-centred growth, skill-linked education, and gender-inclusive labour reforms, the region’s youthful population will shift from being a potential dividend to a shared strategic vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ex-information secretary Ambreen Jan selected to head Pemra</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964676/ex-information-secretary-ambreen-jan-selected-to-head-pemra</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ambreen Jan, former information secretary, was selected on Friday as the new chairperson of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra), which will make her the first female head of the electronic media regulator once her appointment is confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous head of the regulator, Mohammad Saleem Baig, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1410839&quot;&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 and retired last year, leaving the post vacant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meeting of a parliamentary committee, chaired by Shehbaz Babar, selected Jan after it was convened to appoint the next head of the influential media regulatory authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the committee’s unanimous approval, Jan’s name was forwarded to President Asif Ali Zardari for final confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Grade 22 officer, Jan has also previously served as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1882974/?utm_source=newskit_ai&quot;&gt;managing director&lt;/a&gt; of the state broadcaster &lt;em&gt;PTV,&lt;/em&gt; the director general of &lt;em&gt;Radio Pakistan&lt;/em&gt; and press counsellor to Bangladesh while relations were strained from 2011 to 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was among five shortlisted candidates considered for the post, including Brigadier (retd.) Anwar Ahmed, Mateen Haider, Irfan Ashraf, and Dr Hamid Khan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>India to tour Bangladesh for white-ball matches in September</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964679/india-to-tour-bangladesh-for-white-ball-matches-in-september</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;India’s postponed six-match white-ball cricket tour of Bangladesh will take place in September, Bangladesh’s Cricket Board said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series, including three one-day and three T20 matches, originally due to be played in August 2025, was delayed after both countries’ boards “mutually agreed to defer” the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India will now play three ODIs and three T20s between September 1 to 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The postponement last year came as political relations between India and neighbouring Bangladesh turned frosty, after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina fled to India, where she has remained, straining relations between Dhaka and New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh has repeatedly requested Hasina’s extradition. She was sentenced to death in absentia in November for orchestrating a deadly crackdown on the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But New Delhi is also closely watching the upcoming elections on February 12, the first vote in the South Asian nation of 170 million people since the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar visited Bangladesh to attend the funeral of former leader Khaleda Zia, the most senior visit by an Indian official since the overthrow of Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is widely seen as a frontrunner in elections, and her son Tarique Rahman, who returned last month after 17 years in exile, is seen as a potential prime minister if it wins a majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will also host series against Pakistan, New Zealand, Australia and the West Indies, across all three formats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Spectrum-starved country’: IT minister says govt to auction 600 MHz spectrum next month</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964674/spectrum-starved-country-it-minister-says-govt-to-auction-600-mhz-spectrum-next-month</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Federal Minister for IT and Telecommunications Shaza Fatima Khawaja announced on Friday that Pakistan would auction the 600 megahertz (MHz) spectrum next month to provide better internet speeds and roll out 5G in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a meeting last week, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962943&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the process of auctioning the 600 MHz spectrum within two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The spectrum available for our telecom industry is extremely limited,” said the minister while addressing the media in Islamabad, and added that telcos “provide services in the country using just the 274 MHz”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a spectrum-starved country,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a country of 240 million people with only 274 MHz of spectrum,” she stated, adding that “Bangladesh, with about two-thirds of Pakistan’s population, provides 600 MHz.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spectrum is the range of radio frequencies that carries wireless signals for mobile phones, the internet, TV, and radio. Mobile networks like 3G, 4G, and 5G operate by sending data over specific frequency bands within this spectrum. In South Asia, Bangladesh, India, Bhutan, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka have launched 5G networks nationwide, while Pakistan, Nepal, and Afghanistan have yet to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal minister maintained that spectrum availability in Pakistan was the lowest in the region due to the absence of any major spectrum auction for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will not only improve our 3G and 4G services, but also introduce 5G in Pakistan for the first time,” she elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal minister emphasised that the internet was “critical infrastructure,” like roads used to be in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The internet plays a crucial role in the development of the social sector, large-scale economic policies, and national and personal security. Without this [600MHz] level of connectivity, we cannot move forward,” she maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT minister said that it is vital to perceive the internet and connectivity as an “enabling tool” that will unlock the country’s “ economic potential and create employment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, during a press conference alongside the finance minister, Khawaja said that the government was trying to ensure that the auction is completed by the end of January or early February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal minister said that in the auction, additional bands were being offered in Pakistan for the first time, which would not only improve 3G and 4G quality but also ensure the rollout of 5G services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stressed that the internet was integral to the government’s digitisation efforts as part of the Digital Nation Pakistan Act, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, the consultant for the 5G spectrum auction &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955349&quot;&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; its report to the government, which had remained stalled due to the merger of PTCL and Telenor and litigation over the 2600 MHz band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report, prepared by US-based consultancy firm National Economic Research Associates (NERA), noted that Pakistan was offering 606MHz of new spectrum across six major bands: 700MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz, 2600MHz and 3500MHz. The 2600MHz band was considered the most suitable for 5G.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>From the rift with the U.S. to a slow rapprochement with China, but reduced ties with Russia. From the new normal in conflict with Pakistan and spiralling ties with Bangladesh, to closer bonds with the Taliban in Afghanistan — 2025 was India’s most challenging year in foreign policy.

      <title>Assault On The Aravallis: Development Models India Must Eschew</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/assault-aravallis-development-models-india-must-eschew</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;India today sits at the bottom of the rank of countries in the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), which combines a range of indicators like climate change mitigation, air pollution, waste management, sustainability of fisheries and agriculture, deforestation, and biodiversity protection. The EPI is produced by centres working under Yale and Columbia universities. The 2024 listing showed India at rank 176 out of 180, just ahead of Pakistan (rank 179) but behind Bangladesh (175), China (156), and Sri Lanka (134).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Just a handshake</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964530/just-a-handshake</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;IT was a handshake that sent a ripple through the region. On Wednesday, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964291&quot;&gt;shook hands in Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;, where they had both arrived to attend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964271&quot;&gt;state funeral of former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;passed away &lt;/a&gt;earlier this week. It was, doubtless, a significant moment which invited attention across three countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chief Adviser of the Government of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/ChiefAdviserGoB/status/2006340330585833665&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made note of it in a post on his X account&lt;/a&gt;, which stated that the two men had “exchanged greetings” during their interaction ahead of the funeral programme organised for Ms Zia. Pictures of the two, sombrely attired for the occasion, accompanied his post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian media downplayed the event, framing the handshake as a usual nicety at such events and therefore inconsequential. The Pakistani media, noting that it was the first high-level contact between the two nations since the May hostilities, ran with the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/NAofPakistan/status/2006331508479664546&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement issued by the National Assembly Secretariat&lt;/a&gt;, underlining the part where it claimed that the handshake and pleasantries had been initiated by Mr Jaishankar, who reportedly approached Mr Sadiq with an informal acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason for the interest could be that this is a slow time of the year for newsrooms. Another could be that anticipation has continuously been high for what happens next between Pakistan and India. Yet, given the prevailing atmosphere, not much can or should be read into a mere handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the NA Secretariat’s statement on the ‘handshake’ notes that Pakistan has “consistently emphasised dialogue, restraint and cooperative measures, including proposals for peace talks and joint investigations into the alleged false flag Pahalgam incident, in order to prevent unprovoked aggression and escalation”. Can this be read as a signal to New Delhi that the door to talks remains open?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the hostile rhetoric and posturing from next door show no signs of relenting. Recent reports regarding plans for controversial hydropower projects by India, which would violate the Indus Waters Treaty, are designed to be provocations for further tensions between the two states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, without question, a strong need for temperatures to be brought down. But handshakes and exchanging pleasantries alone will not make that happen. It will require earnest effort, especially on New Delhi’s part, and diplomacy at the highest levels before a thaw can be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

Congress has stepped in to defend Khan, labeling the criticism an attack on India&apos;s pluralism. The debate highlights differing views on nationalism and inclusion,</description>

    &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-subhead&quot;&gt;The European Court of Human Rights issued a new challenge against the UK&apos;s decision to strip Begum of her citizenship amid concerns she was groomed and trafficked into Syria&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-cutline&quot;&gt;A source told the BBC that British Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will prioritise national security and not restore Shamima Begum&apos;s UK citizenship (AFP)&lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has vowed to “robustly defend” the Conservative Party’s decision to revoke the citizenship of a British woman who fled to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/syria&quot;&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; as a 15-year-old to join the Islamic State (IS) group after a European Court challenged the move. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A government source told the BBC that Mahmood will defend the decision to strip &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-supreme-court-refuse-hear-shamima-begum-appeal&quot;&gt;Shamima Begum&lt;/a&gt; of her citizenship after the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) asked the Home Office whether ministers considered Begum was a victim of trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The home secretary will robustly defend the decision to revoke Shamima Begum’s citizenship, which has been tested and upheld time and again in our domestic courts,” said the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The home secretary will always put this country’s national security first.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last December, the Strasbourg court &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/shamima-begum-uk-citizenship-european-court-human-rights-challenges-uk-government-citizenship-stripping&quot;&gt;sent a series of questions &lt;/a&gt;to the UK government, asking whether it broke anti-trafficking obligations when it stripped Begum of her citizenship in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions include whether the government violated Article 4 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which prohibits slavery, servitude and forced labour, as well as a state’s duty to prevent and investigate trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Former Northern Ireland lord chief justice says UK wrong to strip Shamima Begum of citizenship&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/former-northern-irish-lord-chief-justice-says-uk-wrong-strip-shamima-begum-citizenship&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped Begum of her citizenship on national security grounds after his office argued that the deprivation was “conducive to the public good” and she posed a threat to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javid also justified the decision to strip her British citizenship on the grounds that Begum qualified for a Bangladeshi passport because of her parents’ heritage, despite never visiting or living in the South Asian country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begum made headlines when she fled to Syria in 2015 to join IS with two school friends from her East London home. She then reappeared four years later, at an advanced stage of pregnancy, after journalists tracked her down in IS territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Begum has tried multiple times, in a series of legal battles with the UK government, to regain her British citizenship, none of which have succeeded, while being held in a prison camp in northern Syria controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECHR is now assessing whether the Home Office failed to take into account whether she was a victim of trafficking, and if removing her citizenship could have prevented the government from fulfilling its duty to investigate how she was allowed to leave the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&apos;Catalogue of failures&apos;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their application to the Strasbourg court, Begum’s lawyers said the decision violated Article 4 of the ECHR and that the UK authorities failed to ask four questions before depriving her of her citizenship: whether she had been trafficked to Syria; whether British authorities failed to protect her; whether her deprivation of citizenship would undermine any future investigation into potential trafficking; and, if trafficking issues were present, whether deprivation could be justified on national-security grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birnberg Peirce, the law firm that is representing Begum, described the ECHR’s intervention as an “unprecedented opportunity” for the UK government to assess whether previous administrations ignored or sidestepped the considerations to be taken into account to strip her of her citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Strasbourg’s communication presents an unprecedented opportunity for the UK as well as for Ms Begum to grapple with the significant considerations raised in her case and ignored, sidestepped or violated up to now by previous UK administrations,” said&amp;nbsp;lawyer&amp;nbsp;Gareth Peirce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is impossible to dispute that a 15-year-old British child was in 2014/15 lured, encouraged and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to ISIL-controlled territory for the known purpose of being given, as a child, to an ISIL fighter to propagate children for the Islamic State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The police failed to warn families, informed the school that its apprehension of risk was overstated, conducted no safeguarding measures, delayed contact with ports and known routes of travel to trigger alarms and prevent [them] reaching the known destination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, Declan Morgan, the former lord chief justice of Northern Ireland, said Britain&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/former-northern-irish-lord-chief-justice-says-uk-wrong-strip-shamima-begum-citizenship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;should not have stripped&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Begum of her citizenship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan, who serves as a a supplementary panel member of the UK Supreme Court, made the remarks&amp;nbsp; at the launch of a new&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/sweeping-uk-terror-law-label-harmful-behaviour-terrorism-prevent-overhaul&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by the Independent Commission on UK Counter-Terrorism Law, Policy and Practice, which he chairs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Special Immigration Appeals Court (SIAC) found that conditions in the prison camp where Begum is being arbitrarily detained without trial constituted inhuman and degrading treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years later, SIAC also found that the state failed to protect her but noted that its “hands were tied” as a result of the Supreme Court’s limiting the immigration court’s ability to take into consideration the merits of Begum’s case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECHR’s intervention comes as activists ramp up their campaigning against the UK’s growing use of citizenship-stripping powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final judgement is expected at a later date, following submissions from the UK government and Begum’s lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NA Speaker Sadiq, Indian FM Jaishankar shake hands in Dhaka in first high-level contact since May conflict</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964291/na-speaker-sadiq-indian-fm-jaishankar-shake-hands-in-dhaka-in-first-high-level-contact-since-may-conflict</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Speaker of the National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar shook hands in Dhaka on Wednesday, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations between Islamabad and New Delhi reached their lowest point this year following an attack in Pahalagam, in Indian-occupied Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan, while Islamabad denied any connection and offered — and continues to offer — an independent probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A press release from the NA Secretariat stated that during Sadiq’s visit to Dhaka for former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia’s funeral, Jaishankar approached him for a handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indian External Minister Dr S Jaishankar approached the Speaker [of the] National Assembly and shaked hands,” the press release read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During this interaction, Dr S Jaishankar introduced himself to the speaker and told the speaker that he had recognised him [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;].”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NAofPakistan/status/2006331508479664546&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press release added that since the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan has “consistently emphasised dialogue, restraint and cooperative measures, including proposals for peace talks and joint investigations into the alleged false flag Pahalgam incident, in order to prevent unprovoked aggression and escalation“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Pahalgam incident, India took a raft of unilateral diplomatic measures against Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the Indian measures, the suspension of the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTs/Volume%20419/volume-419-I-6032-English.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Indus Waters Treaty&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (IWT) stood out as the most severe. The 1960 pact, brokered by the World Bank, has endured through wars and decades of hostility. Its suspension, therefore, marked a watershed moment in the already fraught relationship between the nuclear-armed neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India further lowered diplomatic ties by closing down the main border transit point, framing the attack as a grave provocation that warranted significant diplomatic, economic, and logistical pressure on Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan called for an independent and transparent investigation into the attack, strongly denying India’s accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, New Delhi launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;deadly air strikes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of a four-day clash between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;tit-for-tat strikes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reach a ceasefire&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;issued&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had sounded the alarm on New Delhi’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961827&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;variations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the flow of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which caused consternation among farmers in Punjab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1920727&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reaffirmed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute-resolution mechanisms. In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh mourns ex-PM Khaleda Zia with state funeral</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964271/bangladesh-mourns-ex-pm-khaleda-zia-with-state-funeral</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh bade farewell on Wednesday to former prime minister Khaleda Zia in a state funeral drawing vast crowds, mourning a towering leader whose career defined politics for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda, the first woman to serve as prime minister in the South Asian nation of 170 million people,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt; died&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday aged 80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flags were flown at half-mast, and thousands of security officers lined the streets as her body was carried through the streets of the capital Dhaka in a vehicle in the colours of the national flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large crowds had gathered outside parliament — many waving national flags or those of Khaleda’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — where the funeral prayers were &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/passing-khaleda-zia/news/khaleda-zias-body-taken-gulshan-flag-draped-vehicle-4069821&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;held&lt;/a&gt; at around 3pm local time, according to Dhaka-based &lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChiefAdviserGoB/status/2006315795283083711&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda was laid to rest alongside her late husband, Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981 during his time as president. The burial took place at around 4:30pm local time, &lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy-year-old retired government official Minhaz Uddin, who was attending Khaleda’s funeral, said he had never voted for her, but came to honour the three-time prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I came here with my grandson, just to say goodbye to a veteran politician whose contributions will always be remembered,” he said, watching from behind a barbed wire barricade as her body passed by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Khaleda Zia has been an inspiration,” mourner Sharmina Siraj told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;, adding that “it is difficult to imagine women in leadership positions anytime soon”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 40-year-old mother of two said stipends introduced by Khaleda to support girls’ education “had a huge impact on the lives of our girls”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#na-speaker-meets-family-expresses-condolences&quot; id=&quot;na-speaker-meets-family-expresses-condolences&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;NA speaker meets family, expresses condolences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, who is in Bangladesh for the funeral, visited the residence of the former Bangladeshi prime minister, where he met her son and daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat, Sadiq expressed his condolences at the passing of their mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this hour of grief and sorrow, the government and the people of Pakistan stand with you,” he was quoted as saying. The family of the late premier thanked Sadiq for his condolences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NA speaker also met the country’s national security adviser, Khalilur Rehman, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said that Sadiq “conveyed a message of sympathy and condolences on behalf of the residents and prime minister of Pakistan”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker also met the adviser for law, justice and parliamentary affairs of Bangladesh, Asif Nazrul, where the two discussed matters of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, a post on the NA‘s X account said Sadiq also had an interaction with Indian Foreign Minister Dr S, Jaishankar at Bangladesh’s parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#legacy-lives-on&quot; id=&quot;legacy-lives-on&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Legacy lives on’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959216&quot;&gt;ill health&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1388124&quot;&gt; imprisonment&lt;/a&gt;, Khaleda had vowed to campaign in elections set for 12 February — the first vote since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party is widely seen as a frontrunner, and her son Tarique Rahman, 60, who returned only last week after 17 years in exile, is seen as a potential prime minister if they win a majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She is no more, but her legacy lives on — and so does the BNP,” said Jenny Parvez, 37, who travelled for several hours with her family to watch the funeral cortege pass her on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interim government, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, declared three days of national mourning and an elaborate state funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus said Bangladesh had “lost a great guardian”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#unbreakable&quot; id=&quot;unbreakable&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Unbreakable’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarique Rahman said in a statement that “the country mourns the loss of a guiding presence that shaped its democratic aspirations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mother, he added, “endured repeated arrests, denial of medical care, and relentless persecution”, but that “her resilience … was unbreakable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering from a raft of health issues, Khaleda was rushed to hospital in late November, where her condition had gradually deteriorated despite treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, hours before her death, party workers had on Monday submitted nomination papers on her behalf for three constituencies for next year’s polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he hoped Khaleda’s “vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership”, a warm message despite the strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka since Hasina’s fall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2025 — Pakistan’s year of water wars</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963930/2025-pakistans-year-of-water-wars</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will remember 2025 for a couple of reasons. One, and most pivotal of them, is water, and not because of a single catastrophic event, but because multiple hydrological, political, and climatic crises converged simultaneously, dismantling the long-held assumption that water management is merely a technical or seasonal concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the year, water moved decisively into the realm of national security, federal cohesion, public health, and regional diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan entered 2025 with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1886804&quot;&gt;drier-than-average winter&lt;/a&gt;, slid rapidly into one of the most severe heatwave seasons on record, endured compound monsoon disasters, and concluded the year facing unprecedented transboundary water hostility on both its eastern and western borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges, however, were not just external. Internally, long-standing inter-provincial distrust over water allocation erupted into mass protests, as Sindh confronted an existential crisis spanning agriculture, access to drinking water, coastal survival, and deteriorating infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, we take a closer look at all that unfolded this year to make 2025 a turning point in Pakistan’s water history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#transboundary-hydropolitics&quot; id=&quot;transboundary-hydropolitics&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Transboundary hydropolitics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Indus Waters Treaty shock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the Indus Water Treaty, forged by an unlikely alliance of world powers in 1960, withstood over six decades, survived wars, and braved diplomatic crises, serving as a stunning example of international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that, however, collapsed in 2025, when on April 23, India formally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075&quot;&gt;placed the treaty in abeyance&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source&quot;&gt;Pahalgam attack&lt;/a&gt;. The immediate consequence was not the physical diversion of river flows, but the suspension of hydrological data sharing, which is an essential pillar for flood forecasting, reservoir operations, and irrigation planning in downstream Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss of advanced flow information during an exceptionally volatile monsoon season sharply increased downstream flood risk and operational uncertainty. Although Pakistan managed information through alternative national and international sources, India’s posture in water diplomacy appeared increasingly irresponsible, signalling an attempt to weaponise water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weaponisation of water and consistent threats were met with an appropriate and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1953682&quot;&gt;timely response &lt;/a&gt;from Pakistan, which involved declaring any unilateral diversion of western rivers an act of war and marking an unprecedented securitisation of water. Although international arbitration processes continued and interpretative rulings were issued later in the year, the treaty’s normative authority was thoroughly weakened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The western frontier: Afghanistan and the Kunar River&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While attention remained fixed on India, a quieter but equally destabilising hydrological threat emerged on Pakistan’s western frontier. In October 2025, the Taliban administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1950983&quot;&gt;ordered &lt;/a&gt;the immediate construction of a major dam on the Kunar River, a tributary that provides the bulk of the flow to the Kabul River system, sustaining large parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a formal water-sharing treaty between Pakistan and Afghanistan, bilateral water relations rely on customary practices that are now under visible strain. Few voices in Pakistan called for the counter-diversion of the Chitral River, signalling how water infrastructure has begun to function as a strategic instrument in an increasingly volatile regional landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#inter-provincial-water-governance&quot; id=&quot;inter-provincial-water-governance&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Inter-provincial water governance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestically, 2025 exposed the fragility of Pakistan’s federal water compact. The launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1892713&quot;&gt;Green Pakistan Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, aimed at converting millions of acres of land into corporate farmland through new irrigation canals, triggered the most intense inter-provincial water conflict in decades. The proposed Cholistan Canal became the central flashpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sindh’s opposition was grounded in hydrological reality: there is no demonstrable surplus water in the Indus system capable of sustaining new large-scale irrigation without reducing downstream flows. Political leaders, farmers, lawyers, and civil society framed the project as a violation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1922326&quot;&gt;1991 Water Apportionment Accord&lt;/a&gt; and a direct threat to Sindh’s agriculture and the already collapsing Indus Delta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass protests, highway blockades, and resolutions passed in the Sindh Assembly reflected a rare province-wide consensus that upstream water diversion had become an existential issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with escalating unrest, the federal government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1906331&quot;&gt;halted &lt;/a&gt;canal construction in late April, a decision later formalised by the Council of Common Interests (CCI). The body returned provisional approvals and directed that no new canal could proceed without full provincial consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this intervention reaffirmed constitutional federalism, it did not eliminate underlying structural tensions. Corporate agriculture remains a federal priority, while inter-provincial trust remains deeply eroded. Even technically successful reservoir management later in the year could not fully restore confidence in allocation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#from-climatic-extremes-to-systemic-failures&quot; id=&quot;from-climatic-extremes-to-systemic-failures&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From climatic extremes to systemic failures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1944130&quot;&gt;came the floods&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most consequential hydrological events since 2022, not because of the physical damage they caused but because they exposed systematic failures in water governance, infrastructure planning, and disaster preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a single flood pulse, 2025 witnessed a sequence of high-intensity rainfall events, sudden upstream releases, massive landslides and urban drainage collapse, producing cascading flood risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monsoon began earlier than average in late June and extended deep into September, marked by intense cloudburst events. On July 17, Rawalpindi received approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1924943&quot;&gt;230 millimetres of rainfall&lt;/a&gt; within 24 hours, overwhelming drainage systems and inundating urban settlements. Similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1938525&quot;&gt;flash flooding occurred across KP and northern Punjab&lt;/a&gt;, where steep catchments rapidly converted rainfall into destructive flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riverine flooding followed as exceptional rainfall in the upper Indus Basin coincided with reduced predictability in upstream releases. In late August, sudden discharges — particularly on the Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab rivers — combined with local rainfall to inundate large tracts of Punjab. Satellite analysis later confirmed that more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1940647&quot;&gt;1.3 million hectares of farmland were submerged&lt;/a&gt;, severely damaging rice, cotton, and sugarcane crops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; This aerial view shows partially submerged residential buildings following the overflowing of the Ravi River in Lahore on August 30, 2025. &amp;mdash; AFP &quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/311129000f52d5d.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;This aerial view shows partially submerged residential buildings following the overflowing of the Ravi River in Lahore on August 30, 2025. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sindh, on the other hand, experienced a different flood dynamic. After entering the year under drought conditions, the province faced rapid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942352&quot;&gt;river swelling at Guddu and Sukkur barrages&lt;/a&gt;. Emergency discharges forced evacuations of around 150,000 people from vulnerable riverine areas, illustrating the absence of adaptive operational management under extreme variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, the floods claimed over 1,000 lives, displaced more than six million people, and damaged critical infrastructure. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1944130&quot;&gt;economic impact &lt;/a&gt;was severe, with flood-related disruptions shaving an estimated 0.5 per cent off national GDP. Beyond immediate destruction, floodwaters mobilised sewage, industrial effluents, and agro-chemicals, contaminating drinking water sources and triggering post-flood disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overarching lesson was stark: floods in Pakistan are no longer episodic natural disasters but systemic stress tests, exposing the same governance failures with increasing intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#droughts-to-floods&quot; id=&quot;droughts-to-floods&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Droughts to floods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sindh embodied the contradictions of 2025 more acutely than any other province. Early &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1898669&quot;&gt;Kharif water shortages&lt;/a&gt;, now a recurring feature, once again reduced cotton sowing and devastated mango orchards at critical growth stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the year progressed, the irrigation crisis morphed into a public health emergency. In rural areas, women and children travelled long distances to collect saline and contaminated water. In cities, reliance on water tankers surged beyond affordability. Only about a quarter of Sindh’s population had access to safely managed drinking water, while water-borne diseases increased silently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  &quot;&gt;

        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Women clear wastage from cotton fibers in Kabirwala, Pakistan September 18, 2025. — Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Indus Delta continued its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1895480&quot;&gt;slow collapse&lt;/a&gt;. Insufficient freshwater flows below Kotri accelerated seawater intrusion, rendering fertile land unproductive and displacing more than 1.2 million people over the past two decades. Mangrove loss, collapse of fisheries, and salinisation transformed large areas into ecological dead zones, fuelling migration toward already overstressed cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It increasingly appears that the delta no longer belongs to anyone. Even in 2025, when relatively improved flows reached the delta, voices emerged claiming that water had been “wasted” by flowing to the sea — an outlook that is anti-river, anti-resilience, anti-sustainability, and ultimately anti-people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, investigations into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1843096&quot;&gt;Sukkur Barrage gate failures &lt;/a&gt;exposed years of deferred maintenance. Fortunately, a major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962471&quot;&gt;rehabilitation and modernisation project&lt;/a&gt; was already underway. Even with the progress in 2025, the system remains under significant stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Karachi, the K-IV project reached only 64pc completion despite massive expenditure, while demand continued to exceed supply by nearly 550 MGD. Moreover,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1916618&quot;&gt; serious questions remain&lt;/a&gt; about whether the project’s design and execution will translate into the intended outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#the-question-of-water-governance&quot; id=&quot;the-question-of-water-governance&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The question of water governance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.adb.org/awdo/editions/2025&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Asian Water Development Outlook&lt;/a&gt; (AWDO), released by the Asian Development Bank, brought yet another water reality to the fore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report placed Pakistan near the bottom of regional water security rankings, underscoring that the country’s water crisis stems less from absolute scarcity and more from persistent governance failure. Assessing 50 economies across rural, urban, economic, environmental, and disaster dimensions, the document showed that Pakistan’s National Water Security Index improved by only 6.4 points between 2013 and 2025 — below the regional average and far behind neighbours such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rural water security remains in the second-lowest tier, marked by poor water quality, limited piped supply, sanitation deficits, and a high burden of water-borne disease, reflecting weak integration of WASH into climate adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban water security is even more alarming: despite marginal gains, Pakistan’s urban drainage score fell to zero, highlighting chronic flooding, unplanned expansion, and infrastructural decay, exemplified by Karachi’s persistent supply deficits and informal tanker economy. Economic water security stagnated, while environmental water security deteriorated most visibly in the shrinking Indus Delta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings reinforce the central lesson of 2025: Pakistan’s water crisis is no longer defined by scarcity alone, but by the growing unsafety of its water and the inequitable, opaque systems through which it is governed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#10-imperatives-for-2026&quot; id=&quot;10-imperatives-for-2026&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;10 imperatives for 2026&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lived experience of 2025 leaves little room for ambiguity and yields ten unavoidable priorities for 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, water must be recognised and governed explicitly as a national security issue that have country level consensus, not merely as a sectoral or engineering concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Pakistan must urgently develop a defensive and adaptive approach to transboundary water challenges, one that not just prepares for uncertainty, but also internationally works for basin-level thinking to save the lives, especially those of people belonging to less privileged backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, inter-provincial water governance must be rebuilt on transparent, publicly accessible data and genuine constitutional consensus, without which technical decisions will continue to provoke political resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, water quality must be elevated from a neglected environmental concern to a full-fledged public health emergency, integrated into health planning, nutrition outcomes, and productivity assessments. This leads us towards the fifth priority: groundwater — now Pakistan’s primary source of water for households and agriculture — must be governed as a shared public resource instead of an unregulated private commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixth, urban water governance, particularly in Karachi, must shift decisively from emergency coping mechanisms toward durable institutional reform, equitable distribution, and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventh, environmental flows to the Indus Delta must be legally guaranteed and treated as essential for human survival, ecological stability, and coastal security, rather than as surplus water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighth, women must be integrated as active decision-makers in water planning and management, recognising their central role beyond the invisible labour of water collection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; Residents work at a damaged property, following monsoon rains and flooding, in Punjab on September 17, 2025. &amp;mdash; Reuters &quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/311140220f5a373.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Residents work at a damaged property, following monsoon rains and flooding, in Punjab on September 17, 2025. — Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, two things that require immediate attention: climate adaptation must be fully mainstreamed into all water planning, replacing reliance on historical averages with scenario-based, flexible, and risk-informed approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, water policy must be anchored in social justice, ensuring that access to safe water is upheld as a fundamental right rather than reduced to a market commodity determined by income and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydrological turbulence of 2025 was not an anomaly; it was a preview. It revealed what happens when fractured water diplomacy, internal mistrust, decaying infrastructure, and climate volatility collide. Water is no longer a sector to be managed; it is a constraint on Pakistan’s survival. Whether 2026 becomes a year of reform or repetition depends on whether the lessons of 2025 are heeded or willfully ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Khaleda Zia&apos;s death creates a political void in Bangladesh, with her son Tarique Rahman poised to lead the BNP.  While past BNP rule saw strained India ties and ISI influence, Rahman&apos;s recent shift may suggest a more liberal, India-friendly stance. This evolution could reshape upcoming elections and regional dynamics.</description>

      <title>Injured Archer included in England T20 World Cup squad but no place for Smith</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964110/injured-archer-included-in-england-t20-world-cup-squad-but-no-place-for-smith</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fast bowler Jofra Archer was included in England’s provisional T20 World Cup squad announced on Tuesday, despite suffering a left side strain that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962981&quot;&gt;ruled him out of&lt;/a&gt; the final two Ashes Tests, but there was no place for wicketkeeper Jamie Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archer’s fellow quick Josh Tongue has been called up to the T20 squad for the first time in a 15-man party to be captained by Harry Brook for the tournament in India and Sri Lanka beginning on February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archer will sit out the warm-up tour to Sri Lanka next month to continue his rehabilitation following the injury he sustained during the third Ashes Test in Adelaide earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brydon Carse will replace Archer in Sri Lanka for three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 internationals beginning on January 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no place, however, in the T20 World Cup squad for Smith who has endured a torrid Ashes tour of Australia, for all that is an unusual starting point in deciding selection for a white-ball tournament in the sub-continent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/englandcricket/status/2005906710309798248?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Surrey wicketkeeper-batsman smashed 60 from 26 balls in his last T20 appearance against the West Indies in June, but was rested due to his heavy all-format workload from the subsequent series against South Africa and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963379&quot;&gt;four Tests &lt;/a&gt;in Australia where he has averaged a lowly 19.85 with the bat and endured several struggles behind the stumps, he has been left out entirely, with the experienced Jos Buttler and Phil Salt providing England with keeping options for 2024 T20 World Cup semi-finalists England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tongue, by contrast, has never played white-ball cricket but has enhanced his reputation with impressive Ashes displays in Adelaide and Melbourne, where a England’s four-wicket win still left them 3-1 down heading into a series finale at Sydney starting Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the 28-year-old was the top wicket-taker in last season’s Hundred competition, taking 14 wickets in just six games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test-match opening batsman Zak Crawley returns to the ODI squad for the first time since December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brook will lead his first World Cup campaign as white-ball captain, with England facing Bangladesh, West Indies, Italy and Nepal in Group C, with both managing director Rob Key and coach Brendon McCullum looking for an impressive showing after they came in for criticism following the Test team’s tame Ashes series loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;England T20 squad for World Cup squad and Sri Lanka tour:&lt;/strong&gt; Harry Brook (capt), Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler (wkt), Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Josh Tongue, Luke Wood, Brydon Carse (Sri Lanka tour only)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What drove gen Z protests that brought down governments and called out corruption? Five activists explain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We spoke to protesters in Togo, Kenya, Nepal, Madagascar and Morocco about how their actions helped shape the world in 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass protests in Nepal and Madagascar toppled both governments this year, even when the young people at the forefront of the demonstrations were faced with heavily armed police and the threat of arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many called 2025 the year of the protest although the revolution in Bangladesh in 2024 that unseated the authoritarian leader Sheikh Hasina is often credited with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;inspiring young people to take to the streets across parts of Asia and Africa. Although not all achieved the change they wanted, from Sri Lanka to Timor-Leste they shared a common factor: gen Z was the driving force.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/30/gen-z-protests-corruption-five-activists-nepal-madagascar-togo-kenya-morocco-protesters&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Prime Minister Modi met Congress leader Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury to discuss attacks on Bengali-speaking individuals in BJP-ruled states. Chowdhury highlighted administrative confusion between &quot;Banglabhasi&quot; and &quot;Bangladeshi&quot; people, leading to unjust detentions. This meeting precedes West Bengal&apos;s 2026 assembly elections, while Union Minister Amit Shah is also in the state reviewing BJP&apos;s poll preparedness.</description>

      <title>Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, dies at 80 after prolonged illness</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087/khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-dies-at-80-after-prolonged-illness</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the &lt;em&gt;Fajr&lt;/em&gt; prayer,” the party said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim leader Muhammad Yunus said Bangladesh “has lost a great guardian”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Through her uncompromising leadership, the nation was repeatedly freed from undemocratic conditions and inspired to regain liberty,” the Nobel Peace Prize winner said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I pray for the eternal peace and forgiveness of Begum Khaleda Zia’s soul,” ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina said, in a statement on social media by her now banned Awami League party.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/albd1971/status/2005861396219842701&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;her arch-rival Hasina last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in late November, she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958157&quot;&gt;rushed to hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned to Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh declared three days of state mourning, with Khaleda’s funeral to be held on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim leader Yunus, in a television broadcast to the nation, appealed for calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I humbly appeal to everyone to maintain discipline while observing all forms of mourning, including the funeral prayers. I know you are all deeply emotional at this time,” Yunus said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope that during this difficult period, you will show utmost patience and support one another in carrying out her last rites, including the funeral.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asif Nazrul, who holds the law portfolio in the interim government, said the funeral prayers would be held in front of parliament after midday prayers, and that Zia would then be buried alongside her late husband, Ziaur Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened by Khaleda’s passing. “Her lifelong service to Bangladesh and its growth and development leaves a lasting legacy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Begum Zia was a committed friend of Pakistan. My government and the people of Pakistan stand with the people of Bangladesh in this moment of sorrow,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends and the people of Bangladesh during this difficult time,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said Khaleda’s “leadership and services will be remembered with respect”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also expressed his condolences at Khaleda’s passing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he hoped Zia’s “vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership”, a warm message despite the strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka since Hasina’s fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years later she became the head of the BNP, which her husband had founded, and vowed to deliver on his aim of “liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh’s founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their cooperation did not last long. Their bitter rivalry would lead to the two being dubbed “the battling begums”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters saw her as polite and traditional yet quietly stylish, someone who chose her words carefully. But they also viewed her as a bold, uncompromising leader when it came to defending her party and confronting her rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, by contrast, was far more outspoken and assertive. Their opposite personalities helped fuel the rivalry that dominated Bangladesh’s politics for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the Jamaat-e-Islami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Benazir Bhutto, who was elected three years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.&lt;br /&gt;She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her second term was marred by the rise of militants and allegations of corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 wounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda’s government and its allies were widely blamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, after Hasina had reclaimed Bangladesh’s highest office, Rahman was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP denounced the trial as politically motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#detention-and-freedom&quot; id=&quot;detention-and-freedom&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Detention and freedom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Khaleda later clamped down on radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda never regained power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the BNP boycotting the 2014 and 2024 elections, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tension between their two parties often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding the economic development of Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country of about 175 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Khaleda, Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister — charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda was freed from house arrest in August 2024 after Hasina’s ouster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2025, Khaleda and Rahman were acquitted by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Afghan Taliban visit Bangladesh ahead of elections</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964043/afghan-taliban-visit-bangladesh-ahead-of-elections</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Senior envoy meets religious leaders in push for political clout&lt;br /&gt;• Religious parties eye resurgence in February polls&lt;br /&gt;• Bangladeshi officials label trip as ‘personal’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Afghan Taliban officials have held meetings with religious leaders in Bangladesh during a visit aimed at expanding political ties, officials in Dhaka said on Monday, as the country’s leaders manoeuvre for influence ahead of elections due in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kabul’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Director General Noor Ahmad Noor met senior figures including Mamunul Haque, leader of the Khelafat-i-Majlish party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meetings took place during a week-long stay that comes at a sensitive time for the South Asian nation, which is navigating a fragile transition under an interim government. Haque told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; that Noor had visited the seminary he oversees. “It was a courtesy call, as we run one of the largest madrassas in the country,” Haque said. “He visited some other madrassas as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While religious diplomacy appea­red central to the itinerary, trade was also on the agenda. Abu Sayem Kha­led, president of the Bangladesh-Afgh­a­nistan Chamber of Commerce, told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; that the visit also sought to exp­and commercial ties between the two nations. The interim government has not officially commented on the diplomatic exchange. However, a foreign ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described Noor’s trip as “personal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visit occurs as Bangladesh prepares for its first election since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following her ouster, groups previously sidelined or banned are seeking a return to formal politics. This includes Jamaat-i-Islami, the country’s largest and best-organised religious party, which is ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical precedents of cooperation exist between militants in the two countries; the Taliban had longstanding links with the banned militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami Ban­gl­adesh, with some members of the latter having fought in Afghanistan against Soviet forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reciprocal visits have also incre­ased recently. Leaders of Hefazat-i-Islam, an influential coalition of Isla­mic schools and Muslim organisations, visited Afghanistan in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon their return, they told the Dh­a­ka-based &lt;em&gt;Prothom Alo&lt;/em&gt; newspaper that they appreciated the “rule-based society” they observed under the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, whose archrivalry with &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-hasina-verdict-yunus-security-c1eec828e68460bae66824601a94eaca&quot;&gt;another former premier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defined the country’s politics for a generation, has died, her Bangladesh Nationalist Party said in a statement Tuesday. She was 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia was the first woman elected prime minister of Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had faced corruption cases she said were politically motivated, but in January 2025, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-zia-acquittal-corruption-hasina-supreme-court-bbbbcd38e67a013815b72cc49d45f1c9&quot;&gt;the Supreme Court acquitted Zia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the last corruption case against her, which would have let her run in &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-anniversary-hasina-yunus-uprising-4582f6ae05aac5f50e6922d0c2e778a2&quot;&gt;February’s general election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BNP said that after she was released from prison due to illness in 2020, her family requested the administration of her archrival, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, at least 18 times to allow her to be treated abroad, but the requests were rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-yunus-hasina-zia-politics-uprising-jamaat-f68cacfad0cfd31e33cccb497a564228&quot;&gt;Hasina’s ouster in 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, an interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus finally allowed her to go. She went to London in January and returned to Bangladesh in May. &lt;/p&gt;


    
        




    


&lt;h2&gt;Zia’s fight against the military dictatorship&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-history-photo-gallery-73c4087662ed0e43b91e74429213339e&quot;&gt;early years of independence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, gained in a bloody 1971 war against Pakistan, were marked by assassinations, coups and countercoups as military figures and secular and Islamic leaders jockeyed for power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia’s husband, President Ziaur Rahman, had grabbed power as a military chief in 1977 and a year later formed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. He was credited with opening democracy in the country, but he was killed in a 1981 military coup. Zia’s uncompromising stance against the military dictatorship helped build a mass movement against it, culminating with the ousting of dictator and former army chief H.M. Ershad in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    





&lt;p&gt;



    &lt;p&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;

            
        
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s opponent when she won her first term in 1991 and in several elections after that was Hasina, the daughter of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was assassinated in a 1975 coup. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
        
            
                
    
    &lt;a id=&quot;html-embed-module-e30000&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


    
    &lt;p&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;

            
        
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Zia was criticized over an early 1996 election in which her party won 278 of the 300 parliamentary seats during a wide boycott by other leading parties including Hasina’s Awami League, which demanded an election-time caretaker government. Zia’s government lasted only 12 days before a nonpartisan caretaker government was installed and the new election was held that June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia returned to power in 2001 in a government shared with the country’s main Islamist party, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-islamist-hasina-yunus-7bcf60910c94bef1730d0c8d62f22883&quot;&gt;Jamaat-e-Islami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which had a dark past involving Bangladesh’s independence war. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;Rivalry with Hasina&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party was previously closely allied with the party, and her government maintained the confidence of the business community by following pro-investment, open market policies. Zia was known to have a soft spot for Pakistan and used to deliver anti-Indian political speeches. India alleged insurgents were allowed to use Bangladesh’s soil to destabilize India’s northeastern states under Zia, especially during her second term from 2001-2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that term, Zia was also tainted by allegations that her elder son, Tarique Rahman, was running a parallel government and was involved in widespread corruption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, Hasina blamed Zia’s government and Rahman &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/general-news-15cc06be5bae433a94b5054d8691ad01&quot;&gt;for grenade attacks in Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that killed 24 members of her Awami League party and wounded hundreds of people. Hasina narrowly escaped the attack, which she characterized as an assassination attempt, and subsequently won the 2008 general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia’s party and its partners boycotted the 2014 election in a dispute over a caretaker government, giving a one-sided victory to the increasingly authoritarian regime of Hasina. Her party joined the national elections in 2018 but boycotted again in 2024, allowing Hasina to return to power for a fourth consecutive time &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/sheikh-hasina-awami-league-boycott-opposition-bangladesh-election-1506563c63b06166f800e8e89332b4e3&quot;&gt;through controversial elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia was sentenced to 17 years in jail &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/general-news-272d601763d34acd98a081f9ddf7375c&quot;&gt;in two separate corruption cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for misuse of power in embezzling funds meant for a charity named after her late husband. Her party said the charges were politically motivated to weaken the opposition, but the Hasina government said it did not interfere and the case was a matter for the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hasina was bitterly criticized by both her opponents and independent critics for sending Zia to jail. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;Health concerns trump politics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia was released from jail by Hasina’s government in 2020 and was moved to a rented home, from where she regularly visited a private hospital. Her family repeatedly requested Hasina’s administration to allow Zia to travel abroad for medical treatment, but was refused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 15 years in power, Hasina was ousted in a mass uprising in August 2024 and fled the country. &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-zia-yunus-hasina-election-246a0a75ae2fcab2e03ddfb13c611491&quot;&gt;Zia was given permission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to travel abroad by an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia was silent about politics for years and did not attend political rallies, but she remained the BNP chairperson until her death. Rahman has been the party’s acting chair since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was last seen at an annual function of the Bangladesh military in Dhaka Cantonment on Nov. 21, when Yunus and other political leaders met her. She was in a wheelchair and appeared pale and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is survived by Rahman, her elder son and heir apparent in the political dynasty.

      <title>Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, dies at 80 after prolonged illness</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087/bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-khaleda-zia-dies-at-80-after-prolonged-illness</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the &lt;em&gt;Fajr&lt;/em&gt; prayer,” the party said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bdbnp78/status/2005817539113161047&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in late November, she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958157&quot;&gt;rushed to hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus called for the nation to pray for Zia, calling her a “source of utmost inspiration for the nation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP’s media chief Moudud Alamgir Pavel also confirmed Zia’s death to &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned to Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh’s former prime minister and opposition leader Khaleda Zia has died at the age of 80, her party said Tuesday, just months before elections many expected would return her to power. Her death ends a turbulent political career marked by imprisonment, ill health and a dramatic comeback attempt following the fall of her longtime rival Sheikh Hasina.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, dies at 80</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087/bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-khaleda-zia-dies-at-80</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the &lt;em&gt;Fajr&lt;/em&gt; prayer,” the party said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in late November, she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958157&quot;&gt;rushed to hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus called for the nation to pray for Zia, calling her a “source of utmost inspiration for the nation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP’s media chief Moudud Alamgir Pavel also confirmed Zia’s death to &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned to Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh’s three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia, who hoped to lead her nation one last time after the election next year, died on Tuesday aged 80, her party said.
The government declared three days of state mourning, with her funeral to be held on Wednesday.
Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in the election set for February – the first vote since a mass uprising toppled her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.
