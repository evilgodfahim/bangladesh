      <title>Amid warming ties, Bengalis in Pakistan plan family reunions</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1975334/amid-warming-ties-bengalis-in-pakistan-plan-family-reunions</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;KARACHI: Shah Alam travelled from his home in Bangladesh to Pakistan for a brief visit nearly three decades ago, but flaring hostility between the two countries and financial woes left him stranded in Karachi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the 60-year-old, who makes a modest living selling dried seafood, is determined to return to his birthplace, having already missed the deaths of his parents and first wife in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Direct flights between Pakistan and Bangladesh finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969741&quot;&gt;resumed&lt;/a&gt; last month after a 14-year pause, reflecting a warming of ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shah Alam has already started planning his trip to be reunited with remaining family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will go,” he told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; with teary eyes. “I am facing some financial issues but will certainly go with my son after Eid al-Azha,” referring to the festival expected in late May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shah Alam, who married again in Pakistan, still owns agricultural land and his family home in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Everything is there. I was stuck here,” he told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; in Karachi, near the well-known Bengali market where he sells desiccated fish and prawns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wanted to go back, but there was no way. The relationship [between Pakistan and Bangladesh] was not good. I had no money as well to go back home,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now, I want to see my elder brother and my married daughter who live in Bangladesh,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hussain Ahmed, 20, whose family lives in Machhar Colony does not have Pakistani nationality or an identity card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How can I go [to Bangladesh]? I want to go there,” the fish factory worker told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;. “Even my father doesn’t have an identity card. How can I get it then?” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Bengalis rarely venture outside their home areas owing to fear of being interrogated by law enforcement agencies to prove their “identities” as Pakistani citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local politician Muhammad Rafiqul Hussain, who was born in Karachi, told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; that Bengalis like him live across Pakistan and contribute to the economy like other Pakistanis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is one of the seven elected leaders from the Bengali community in Karachi’s municipal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Hussain, the “cordial relationship” between Pakistan and Bangladesh has made a big difference for Pakistani Bengalis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, community activist and lawyer Hafiz Zainulabdin Shah said Bengalis living in Pakistan have lost some of their identity by adopting local languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But despite Pakistan-based Bengalis living “with a sense of deprivation”, Shah said “they feel content with the newly developed relationship between the two countries”.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trade gap widens 42pc with nine countries to $9bn</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1975357/trade-gap-widens-42pc-with-nine-countries-to-9bn</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s trade deficit with nine regional countries swelled by 41.37 per cent to $9.001 billion in the first seven months (July-January) of FY26, up from $6.367bn in the corresponding period last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The widening gap reflects a fall in Pakistan’s exports to regional markets, driven largely by reduced shipments to China, followed by Afghanistan and Bangladesh. Trade with Afghanistan, including exports, has remained &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964233&quot;&gt;suspended&lt;/a&gt; since October 10, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to India posted a slight increase in percentage terms, though the rise was minimal in dollar value. Meanwhile, shipments to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka declined during the period under review, according to the latest figures &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sbp.org.pk/publications/export/index.htm&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; by the State Bank of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade deficit with the nine countries widened by 29.42pc to $12.297bn in FY25 compared to $9.502bn in the preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of Pakistan’s exports to the nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — declined by 16.86pc to $2.307bn in 7MFY26 compared to $2.775bn a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In FY25, exports to these nine countries recorded a modest increase of 1.49 per cent, rising to $4.401 billion in July to June, up from $4.336 billion in the corresponding period a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to this, imports surged 23.69pc to $11.31bn in 7MFY26 from $9.14bn. Imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the same period of the previous fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that imports from China grew by 24.58pc to $11.097bn in 7MFY26 from $8.907bn over the same period last year. In FY25, imports from China stood at $16.312bn, up by 20.79pc from $13.504bn a year ago. The bulk of imports in the region are sourced from China, followed partially by India and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s exports to China fell by 1.02pc to $1.467bn in 7MFY26 from $1.482bn in the preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imports from India dipped by 9.44pc to $122.56m in 7MFY26 from $135.35m. In FY25, import from New Delhi increased to $220.58m from $206.89m in the preceding year. Meanwhile, exports remained at $2.926m, slightly increased from $0.404m.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to Afghanistan dipped 59.07pc to $228.96m in 7MFY26 from $559.52m last year. Imports stood at $6.36m in 7MFY26 against $15.21m in FY25, a plunge of 58.18pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s exports to Bangladesh declined by 10.48pc to $417.62m in 7MFY26 from $466.55m over the last year. In FY25, exports to Dhaka increased by 19.08pc to $787.35m from $661.19m. Imports grew 14.02pc to $42.17m in 7MFY26 from $49.05m over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to Sri Lanka dipped by 28.89pc to $184.48m in 7MFY26 from $259.43m over the last year. The imports from Sri Lanka rose by 11.63pc $38.57m in 7MFY26 from $34.55m over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>South Africa announce eight home Tests for 2026-27</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1975314/south-africa-announce-eight-home-tests-for-2026-27</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CENTURION: World champions South Africa will play eight Test matches at home in the 2026-27 season, Cricket South Africa (CSA) announced on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa, who beat Australia in the 2023-25 Test championship final at Lord’s in England last year, did not play a single home Test match during the current 2025-26 season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But they will play three Tests against Australia, two against Bangladesh and three against England in the coming season with all three series counting towards the 2025-27 World Test Championship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa are currently in third place in the standings after sharing a series 1-1 in Pakistan and beating India 2-0 in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Tests against Australia will all be at coastal venues — Durban, Gqeberha and Cape Town — starting on Oct 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh series will be played in Johannesburg and Centurion during November, while England will be the visitors over the holiday period of December-January. The England Tests will be in Johannesburg, Centurion and Cape Town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All three tours will also include three-match One-day Internationals series, while Bangladesh will also play three T20 Internationals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;England were also due to play a T20 series but it will be rescheduled because of a clash with the SA20 franchise competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CSA chief executive Pholetsi Moseki said the Test and ODI series were both particularly important for the South African team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have made a promising start to the new World Test Championship cycle and it is important that we continue to build on that momentum and strengthen our position on the WTC table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“On the white-ball front, our focus remains firmly on building towards hosting the ICC men’s Cricket World Cup in 2027. Every ODI series from here forms part of our preparation for that global event.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa’s home fixtures (2026-27):&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>OICCI seeks to break ‘tax paradox’</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974914/oicci-seeks-to-break-tax-paradox</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: The Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has urged the government to immediately freeze all preferential tax treatments — including new exemptions, zero-rating and special regimes — whether introduced through SROs or legislation, unless routed through a fully operational Tax Policy Office (TPO) with a published rationale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a special report titled Pakistan’s Tax Paradox, the OICCI describes Pakistan’s tax system as one characterised by a narrow tax base and high tax rates, with tax revenues remaining largely stagnant as a share of GDP despite growth in absolute collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It notes that Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio has remained between 9 and 10 per cent for over a decade, although reforms have recently pushed it into double digits, reaching 10.3pc in FY25.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this remains well below international benchmarks. According to the World Bank and the IMF, a tax-to-GDP ratio exceeding 15pc is essential for sustainable growth, poverty reduction and the provision of basic public services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report highlights that OECD countries collect taxes equivalent to 34pc of GDP, while the Asia-Pacific average stands at 19.3pc. Pakistan lags behind regional peers such as India (17pc) and Bangladesh (12pc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OICCI recommends that Pakistan’s tax reform agenda be guided by clear outcome targets and disciplined sequencing. It proposes raising the tax-to-GDP ratio from the current 10-12pc range to around 13pc in the short term and above 15pc in the medium term to support growth, strengthen fiscal stability and reduce reliance on debt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among its key recommendations, the report calls for immediate operationalisation of the Tax Policy Office as a gatekeeper for all tax changes, along with a clear separation of tax policy from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR)’s administrative functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also proposes freezing all preferential treatments, removing arbitrary forms of taxation to minimise refund issues, implementing a structured refund clearance plan, starting with refund-heavy sectors, and adopting a consultative approach in designing and reviewing tax regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also recommends eliminating the super tax under Sections 4B and 4C, reducing the corporate tax rate to 28pc, cutting withholding taxes to 5pc and fixing the maximum salary tax slab at 25pc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Asian Development Bank to support AI adoption in Pakistan’s health sector</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974906/asian-development-bank-to-support-ai-adoption-in-pakistans-health-sector</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: The Asian Development Bank will provide technical assistance to Pakistan to enhance understanding and accelerate the deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) applications in health services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ADB has approved regional technical assistance amounting to $950,000 to help Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia reap the benefits of AI for service excellence in health. The assistance will assess AI applications in health promotion, screening, diagnosis, and treatment, and will develop a roadmap for AI adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The governments benefiting from the assistance have requested the ADB to help develop practical AI governance frameworks for anticipated AI innovations, including validation mechanisms, ways to safeguard data privacy and avoid algorithmic bias, and strategies for post-market performance monitoring. These countries are also keen to learn from best practices and use cases for AI tools in clinical care and health management.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, the ADB had supported member countries investing in digital health, helping them adopt digital health information systems, establish common standards, and improve interoperability, thereby laying a strong foundation for big data analytics and AI applications. The assistance will provide timely support to enhance the AI readiness of member countries’ health systems through technical support and capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Bank’s project to assess AI applications in health promotion, screening, diagnosis and treatment&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the project document, the assistance will focus on three types of AI applications that are relevant for ADB projects and are becoming mature. First, applications in the clinical context, including AI-assisted smart point-of-care diagnosis and treatment. Advances in image processing and pattern recognition allow medical equipment to become “smart” enough to generate highly accurate diagnoses at the point of care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, AI applications in healthcare management aim to improve efficiency and the experience of both patients and health workers. Small hospitals can adopt AI solutions to provide a seamless experience for patients — from appointments, registration, consultations, prescriptions, and treatment to follow-ups — and to help manage patient flow. AI could also automate administrative tasks for health professionals and managers, freeing up time for patient care, improving doctor-patient interaction, and preventing burnout, which is common among health professionals in primary care and hospital settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, generative AI and AI agents could assist in distance learning, medical education, and telemedicine, providing clinical decision support for areas and populations with limited physical access. This could significantly improve the effectiveness and efficiency of medical education, upskilling of health workers, and public health education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the project document, AI applications have the potential to transform health service organisation and delivery. They could improve the efficiency, quality, and equitable access to healthcare services. AI leveraging big data analytics, deep learning, natural language processing, and robotics could enhance health management, diagnostics, and treatment capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These technologies also open new possibilities in rapid drug discovery and personalised medicine. AI can automate record-keeping, claims monitoring, and other administrative tasks; reduce health worker burnout; and enhance efficiency, transparency, and quality of patient-doctor interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical assistance will deliver knowledge to inform the design and implementation of ADB projects in Bangladesh, Indonesia and Pakistan. It will survey available AI tools in healthcare and help member countries develop roadmaps for home-grown AI ecosystems that integrate considerations for research and development, technology transfer, commercialization, and procurement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ADB notes that intensified geopolitics, economic uncertainties, and major shifts in the global health aid landscape have constrained the investments needed to improve health outcomes. Governments continue to face gaps in health infrastructure, equipment bottlenecks, mal-distribution of qualified health human resources, insufficient funding to upskill and incentivise health workers, escalating health expenditure, and the proliferation of fragmented and non-interoperable digital health applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Absorbing population growth</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974737/absorbing-population-growth</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;FINALLY, the debate about whether rapid population growth is beneficial or pernicious for the economy appears to be settled. While the evidence was extensive and categorical, it has taken several decades for the numbers to be absorbed by our leading economists. In the meantime, we have potentially lost billions of dollars in GDP, experienced the tragedy of several thousand maternal and child deaths, and seen a decline in per capita income as the cost of not pursuing sound population policies and actions to bring down our rapid population growth rate. While all our neighbours, most prominently Bangladesh, took clear and purposeful steps, we have complacently accepted high and even rising population growth rates since 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The consensus created at DawnMedia’s &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cUNr-LEZxTWbD3UcLWdAvL5EHJZFrRWFCTRsF-4UGt4/edit?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Paki­stan Population Summit&lt;/a&gt; last December confirmed several truths. First and foremost is that economic growth and prosperity for Pakistan are impossible under current demographic trends. High fertility and population growth rates are eating into an already low economic growth, resulting in greater poverty and income inequalities. There is categorical evidence that larger households with more dependents save less, spend less on education and eat lower-quality food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, the expectation of a demographic dividend due to the surge in the working population is an elusive dream. In fact, this dream has been shattered by growing unemployment figures and a rising gap in the ability to generate employment to keep up with the millions of youth entering the labour force each year. The finance minister has publicly admitted that it is next to impossible, as not enough jobs are being generated to keep pace with the forecasted surge in the working-age population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, it was proclaimed that urbanisation would be the engine of growth and generate employment. However, it has been pointed out by &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://knowledgecommons.popcouncil.org/topics_population-policy/21/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pakistan@2050&lt;/a&gt; that structural changes are required to produce more jobs. Rapid urbanisation is being led by a push out of agriculture in rural areas to escape poverty, and not as a pull factor in search of better jobs. In fact, additional jobs in new sectors only provide minimal employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The summit brought together a wide spectrum of participants and speakers, generating some optimism that we have turned the corner on population issues. Foremost, a media house took the initiative of organising a summit on population. Another prominent media house has just launched the Waqfa campaign to raise awareness and change behaviour. Much of this positivity is the outcome of the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nam-Fw4f8AxJWOwIVBdqGPfl0GafIDG7/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Council of Islamic Ideology&lt;/a&gt; and Population Council consultation on the concept of tawazun (balance) and birth spacing last year. This declaration has been endorsed by 37 prominent ulema supporting family planning and birth spacing for improved outcomes for mothers, children and families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expectations of a demographic dividend due to the surge in working numbers are misplaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another hopeful sign is the unusual cross-party support for the national issue of tackling high population growth rates. The Parliamentary Forum for Population has had successful meetings over five years, discussing resource-sharing around population. Forum members passed a unanimous &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hmdk7nFLzPSUU6Dk-gVa0oFkjrBu3926/view?usp=sharing&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;resolution&lt;/a&gt; in parliament last August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a consensus has emerged, why is there very little action at the national or provincial level that reflects a commitment to lowering population growth on an urgent and priority basis? This is not to undermine efforts and statements issued periodically by the provincial and federal leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The need to act is immediate. There is no time for piecemeal efforts or waiting for the provinces to reach the same level of capacity and concern regarding this daunting challenge. The federal government should take the first step and become the dominant partner. It must demonstrate intent, moving beyond statements: theirs should be a policy setting and coordination role with the provinces and regions. Larger provinces, such as Punjab and Sindh, can generate their initiatives, but less-resourced provinces and regions definitely require supplemental funds from the centre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finance minister has been most consistent and prominent in publicly expressing that population growth is not just an impediment but an existential crisis for Pakistan. Creating the financing and resources to balance population concerns, especially in the most challenging, poorest, remotest and vulnerable parts of the country, must be his ministry’s priority. Direct financing for districts that are most vulnerable and lack the basics, preventing millions of households from accessing education, health and family planning, has to become as much of a priority as other financing reforms.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Benazir Income Support Programme is renowned as one of the largest social protection programmes in the world. It is centred on women. Unwanted pregnancies affect the poorest women most directly, as do unwanted and mistimed births, which are not within their control. A cash transfer programme must be launched that enables poorer households to access family planning services. This programme would follow the same rationale as providing income support to women living in the poorest households through BISP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poorest women, when able to fulfil their unmet needs, will provide for improved health outcomes for families and create an economically powerful impetus for improving household welfare. It will present a programme that enables millions to benefit from improving other outcomes — such as their own health, household savings and children’s investments — and trigger a new turnaround dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the federal government must activate and announce the CCI mandated population fund. This population fund should be well-resourced and function under the finance ministry; it would be used to award grants to provinces and regions for additional family planning services. Grants can be directly linked with performance in improving health and related outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is a growing consensus that population concerns will not be solved without improving educational outcomes, particularly for women and girls. The most powerful way of empowering women is through education and skills, but especially through paid work, by ensuring their safety, mobility and employability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is heartening that the public conversation has shifted towards putting women in the driving seat. It is high time that women’s empowerment is seen as a solution to unlocking greater economic growth by tapping into work and earnings potential and reaping the benefits of increased household savings and positive behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan to tour Bangladesh next month for a 3-match ODI series</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974595/pakistan-to-tour-bangladesh-next-month-for-a-3-match-odi-series</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) said on Friday that the Green Shirts would tour Bangladesh in March for a three-match One Day International (ODI) series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/TheRealPCB/status/2024841594105729405&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, the PCB said, “Pakistan men’s cricket team will tour Bangladesh for a three-match ODI series, the Bangladesh Cricket Board confirmed on Friday.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said that the team would arrive in Bangladesh on March 9 and hold a training session the next day, ahead of the opening ODI against the hosts on March 11.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-4/5  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheRealPCB/status/2024841594105729405?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board added that the second ODI would be played on March 13, while the third and final match was scheduled for March 15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that all three matches would be played at the Shere Bangla National Cricket Stadium in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This will be Pakistan’s second tour of Bangladesh since July 2025. Pakistan last toured Bangladesh for a three-match T20I series in July, which the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1925946&quot;&gt;hosts won 2-1&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Bangladesh toured Pakistan for a three-match T20I series in May/June last year, which the Salman Ali Agha-led side &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1914787&quot;&gt;won 3-0&lt;/a&gt;,” the PCB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes after Pakistan announced it would boycott the match against India during the ongoing T20 World Cup. The decision came after Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969924&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to shift its matches out of India was rejected amid tensions between the two countries, which led to the team being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced &lt;/a&gt;by Scotland in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation ultimately led to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;delegation &lt;/a&gt;from the International Cricket Council visiting Pakistan, after which it was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;that Pakistan would play the match against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the ICC also announced that Bangladesh would not face any penalty for opting out of the tournament and would also host an ICC event prior to the Men’s Cricket World Cup in 2031.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The biggest challenges that the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has to tackle following its recent victory in the general election are the country’s sluggish economy, high inflation and unemployment.
Speaking at a webinar, panellists said voters would judge the new government on its ability to create jobs, tame inflation and steady relations with key partners, even as they commended the peaceful election.
Zafar Sobhan, editor of Counterpoint, said: “Let us not forget this was a key driver in...</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Muslims around the world continue to observe Ramazan with devotion and unity, as communities gather for prayers, reflection, and acts of kindness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mosques resonate with nightly Taraweeh prayers, and charitable initiatives reach their peak as believers support those in need. Here are some glimpses from different countries, including Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Palestine, Africa, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How Pakistan is busting the Great Power monopoly on air power</title>
      <link>https://responsiblestatecraft.org/pakistan-air-force-fighter-jets/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://responsiblestatecraft.org/media-library/jf-17-thunder-jet-fighter-pakistan.jpg?id=64965159&amp;amp;width=1200&amp;amp;height=600&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C117%2C0%2C118&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a familiar refrain heard through the packed halls of the Munich Security Conference this year — soliloquies on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/10/europe/trump-munich-security-conference-report-intl-hnk&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;decades-long prosperous international order&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” now under unprecedented strain. The gathering, as ever, was an echo chamber of transatlantic anxiety, tinged with denial about the steady unraveling of Western primacy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thousands of miles away, however, a more consequential transformation is unfolding. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inside the&lt;a href=&quot;https://nastp.gov.pk/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;National Aerospace Science and Technology Park&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(NASTP) in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, visitors moved through halls lined with scaled-down models of fighter jets and combat drones, pausing at flight simulators where students honed their skills, and observed engineers guiding startups through prototype development. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than an industrial showcase, NASTP captured a structural shift reshaping global security, as airpower is steadily democratized and credible aerial capability passes from the monopoly of wealthy Western states into the hands of emerging powers in the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For much of the modern era, scenes like this would have been unthinkable outside a narrow circle of elite powers. Advanced airpower demanded massive defense budgets, well-developed technological ecosystems, and political alignment with Western security networks that controlled access to cutting-edge aircraft, avionics and precision weapons. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Air superiority became the strategic privilege of close U.S. allies, the Soviet Union/Russia, and the handful of wealthy states able to sustain the financial and diplomatic costs of maintaining modern fleets. Export controls, sanctions regimes and political conditionalities ensured that control of the skies remained tightly guarded. Today, however, that long-standing monopoly is steadily eroding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An example of this monopoly was U.S. control of the F-16, one of the most coveted fighter aircraft of the Cold War. Produced by General Dynamics, the multirole jet combined air-to-air combat capability with precision strike, a versatility it demonstrated in 1981 when Israeli F-16s destroyed &lt;a href=&quot;https://shafaq.com/en/Report/Israel-s-raid-on-Osirak-as-a-brave-new-world-JP-reported&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iraq’s Osirak nuclear reactor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, the F-16 became the geopolitical reward for serving as Washington’s frontline ally in expelling the Soviets from Afghanistan after 1980, while its rival India remained largely dependent on Soviet aircraft during the Cold War. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, and increasing tensions between the U.S. and Pakistan after 2001, led to a strategic regional realignment in South Asian arms procurement, and the erosion of Western dominance over advanced airpower. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift became impossible to ignore when Washington moved in 2020 to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2020/08/12/congress-has-secretly-blocked-us-arms-sales-to-turkey-for-nearly-two-years/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;block fellow NATO-member Turkey from acquiring advanced F-16 upgrades&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; following Ankara’s purchase of Russia’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/turkeys-missile-dilemma-choice-between-russia-and-us&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;advanced S-400 missile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; air defense system. The decision exposed how even close allies remain vulnerable to Western export controls. Ankara responded by accelerating its indigenous drone program, producing low-cost, combat-proven platforms that would soon reshape battlefields from Ukraine and the Caucasus to the Middle East and Africa, a transformation catalyzed and accelerated by the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In parallel, Pakistan and China advanced the JF-17. The name of the affordable jet took a swipe at its Western competitors, with “JF” standing for “Joint Fighter” and the number 17 suggesting an upgrade over the F-16. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China&apos;s willingness to transfer technology and co-produce advanced systems enabled Pakistan to field a modern multirole fighter capable of shooting down aircraft with beyond-visual-range missiles, delivering precision-guided munitions against ground targets and tracking multiple threats through its active electronically scanned array radar. Together, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-05/turkey-plans-drone-facility-in-pakistan-in-global-defense-push?embedded-checkout=true&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turkish combat drones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the JF-17 have shattered the exclusivity of airpower, dismantling the financial and political barriers that long restricted credible aerial capability to a narrow circle of privileged states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, this transformation has been both strategic and reputational. Co-developed with China and increasingly produced domestically, the JF-17 anchors Islamabad’s shift from arms importer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2026/02/pakistans-burgeoning-arms-industry-strategic-opportunity-us/411168/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;aerospace power broker&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That evolution gained global visibility during the four-day conflict last May, when Pakistani aircraft allegedly downed the Indian Rafale aircraft purchased from the French firm Dassault. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That success generated international attention and drew rare &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972507&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;public praise from U.S. President Donald Trump&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sharply boosting interest in the aircraft. Since then, the JF-17’s export footprint has expanded across Nigeria, Myanmar, Azerbaijan, and Iraq, with interest growing across Africa, the Middle East, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/9/why-is-pakistan-selling-its-jf-17-fighter-jets-to-bangladesh-and-others&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Southeast Asia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By offering a capable, affordable alternative to Western and Russian fighters, Pakistan is reshaping procurement choices for mid-tier states. In doing so, it is no longer merely buying security but it is increasingly enabling it, positioning itself as a strategic node in a rapidly diversifying global defense ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consequences of this shift extend beyond arms markets, as smaller and mid-tier states acquire credible airpower for the first time and regional hierarchies flatten and deterrence relationships recalibrate. In volatile regions from South Asia to the Middle East and the Caucasus, this diffusion of airpower is fundamentally altering how influence, coercion, and stability are negotiated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“For mid-tier powers, the war in Ukraine showed that without effective airpower, maneuver alone cannot deliver decisive battlefield outcomes. Instead, it drives conflicts toward attritional stalemate and forces a reassessment of force structure and operational concepts,” observes Lt Col Steen Kjaergaard from the Royal Danish Defence College, Denmark, who has closely followed the war in Ukraine to study the battlefields of tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at NASTP in Rawalpindi, the objective is not merely to manufacture aircraft, but to cultivate human capital and technological depth underpinning long-term strategic autonomy. By embedding aerospace development within an entrepreneurial framework, Pakistan is laying the groundwork for enduring defense sovereignty, ensuring that its growing airpower is supported by indigenous skills, research capacity and industrial resilience rather than perpetual external dependence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Air Marshal (Ret.) Aamir Masood, who served in the Pakistan Air Force for over 40 years, “Aerospace [is likely to] remain as a weapon of choice for future leadership.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He says that the future “is all about non-contact warfare with beyond visual range precise ammunition, swarming drones and combat unmanned vehicles assisted by Artificial Intelligence based algorithms Decision support tools (DSTs). A country with better integration and networking would be able to have a faster OODA (Observe- Orientate- Decide- Act).”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cumulative effect is a reshaping of the global balance of military power. Western dominance of defense markets is weakening as a new cohort of arms exporters led by Turkey, Pakistan and China is redefining access to advanced aerial capability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It is not only about cheaper alternatives. These states offer new solutions for markets confined by the political conditionality, or export mechanisms imposed by the Western world. This change is especially appealing in the Global South, eroding the domination of Western suppliers over elevated military capabilities,” said Flavius Caba-Maria, President of the Middle East Political and Economic Institute in Romania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As more states acquire affordable fighters and combat drones, deterrence relationships are shifting and regional competitions are intensifying, injecting both stability and volatility into fragile security environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The democratization of airpower does not automatically produce peace. Instead, it redistributes leverage, accelerates arms races and complicates strategic calculations. It also signals the arrival of a genuinely multipolar military order, in which technological capability is no longer the exclusive domain of a few privileged states. This transformation is unfolding in real time, redrawing the geopolitical map of the skies and, with it, the nature of air power itself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The budget carrier, facing financial struggles despite recent fundraising, is in communication with Bangladeshi authorities to resolve the issue and resume normal operations.</description>

      <title>Ramazan moon sighted; holy month to begin in Pakistan on Thursday</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974092/ramazan-moon-sighted-holy-month-to-begin-in-pakistan-on-thursday</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee announced on Wednesday that the Ramazan moon was sighted, and the holy month would begin in Pakistan on Thursday (February 19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made by committee chairman, Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad, as it met in Peshawar for the moon sighting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking to the media after the meeting, Azad said that the skies were clear in some areas and cloudy in others.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that testimonies were received from several parts of the country, including Quetta, Islamabad, Waziristan, Dir, Karachi, Buner, Mardan and Tando Allahyar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Therefore, it was decided with consensus that the first day of Ramazan would be on Thursday,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, according to the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/ramadan-begins-tomorrow-moon-sighted-4109261&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the crescent moon was sighted in Bangladesh, while &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/ramzan-fasts-to-begin-in-india-from-february-19/article70648078.ece&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hindu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported that it was also spotted in India.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Afghanistan observed their first day of fasting on Wednesday after the crescent moon was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973918/ramazan-moon-sighted-in-saudi-arabia-uae&quot;&gt;sighted&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended “heartfelt” greetings to the nation, as well as Muslims around the world, on the beginning of Ramazan, state-run &lt;em&gt;APP&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the holy month was a blessing from God and gave Muslims an opportunity to “renew the values of devotion and humility in worship, righteousness and piety and spiritual purification”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fasting is not merely the observance of a religious obligation; rather, it is practical training in patience, discipline and a sense of responsibility in our daily lives,” the PM said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the government had launched a Ramazan Package to “provide maximum possible support to the vulnerable groups”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Under this initiative, financial assistance will be provided to deserving individuals in a dignified manner through digital wallets, ensuring that every household,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari also extended greetings to the nation and the Muslim Ummah, describing the sacred month as a period of mercy, forgiveness, and salvation,  according to &lt;em&gt;APP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“At a time when Pakistan faces various social and economic challenges, Ramazan brings a message of hope, patience, and collective solidarity,” the report quoted the president as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed the resolve that “the nation should rise above personal interests and give priority to national and collective welfare”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on X, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari congratulated the Muslim Ummah on the month of Ramazan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq also extended felicitations to the people of Pakistan and the Muslim Ummah on the commencement of the holy month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He appealed to the public to “demonstrate patience, avoid hoarding and profiteering, and ensure the availability of essential commodities at reasonable prices”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, based on the moon’s expected age, the Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972917&quot;&gt;predicted&lt;/a&gt; that the first day of Ramazan was “likely to fall” on February 19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has announced a Rs38 billion &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973178&quot;&gt;Ramazan Relief Package&lt;/a&gt; for 12.1 million deserving families across the four provinces as well as Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every deserving family will receive Rs13,000 through a digital wallet or bank transfer, without discrimination based on party affiliation or point of view,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A meeting of the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee is currently underway in Peshawar to sight the Ramazan moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee chairman, Maulana Syed Muhammad Abdul Khabir Azad, is presiding over the meeting at the Auqaf Department building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zonal and district Ruet-i-Hilal Committees in Karachi, Islamabad, Lahore and other cities have also gathered to sight the new moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, according to the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/ramadan-begins-tomorrow-moon-sighted-4109261&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the crescent moon was sighted in Bangladesh, meaning that the first day of the holy month would be observed on Thursday (February 19).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Suparco said the final announcement regarding the beginning of the holy month would be made by the Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, “which is the sole competent authority, based on credible witness testimonies from across the country”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Afghanistan observed their first day of fasting on Wednesday after the crescent moon was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973918/ramazan-moon-sighted-in-saudi-arabia-uae&quot;&gt;sighted&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday night.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Farhan, who needed just 20 deliveries to move from 50 to 100, ended on 100 not out off 58 balls, becoming only the second player from Pakistan to score a century in the tournament after Ahmed Shehzad’s ton against Bangladesh in 2014 at Mirpur.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh PM Tarique Rahman names cabinet after election win</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1974089/bangladesh-pm-tarique-rahman-names-cabinet-after-election-win</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s Prime Minister &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973905/bangladeshs-new-prime-minister-political-heir-tarique-rahman&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; has named a former commerce minister to steer the country’s troubled economy and kept the defence portfolio for himself as he formed his first cabinet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973874&quot;&gt;sworn into office&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday after a landslide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890/bangladeshs-bnp-wins-sweeping-election-majority-promises-stability&quot;&gt;election victory&lt;/a&gt;, taking over from the interim administration that had led the country of 170 million people since a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850190&quot;&gt;deadly&lt;/a&gt; 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951527&quot;&gt;uprising&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 50-member cabinet announced in a gazette notification issued late Tuesday includes &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/16933/pakistan-to-boost-trade-ties-with-bd#:~:text=Amir%20Khasru%20Mahmud%20Chowdhury&quot;&gt;Amir Khasru Mahmud Chowdhury&lt;/a&gt;, 76, a businessman and veteran lawmaker who has now returned to the finance ministry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chowdhury is tasked with reviving growth after months of turmoil that rattled investor confidence in the world’s second-largest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1884081&quot;&gt;garment exporter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had previously served in the cabinet of Rahman’s late mother, three-time prime minister &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;Khaleda Zia&lt;/a&gt;, but was forced to resign in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to media reports, his resignation came after he had granted permission for Taiwan to open a commercial office in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chowdhury has not spoken publicly about the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also arrested several times during Sheikh Hasina’s 15-year rule, as her government regularly targeted opposition leaders in cases often decried as politically motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, 60, has appointed himself defence minister, as his government faces a daunting list of challenges, including improving security and healing rifts in a country polarised by years of bitter rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh is squeezed between India — where border tensions are high — and Myanmar, where clashes have spilled over into frontier areas.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh is home to more than a million Rohingya refugees who have fled Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khalilur Rahman is the foreign minister, an experienced diplomat and former UN official who holds degrees from universities in Dhaka and the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khalilur Rahman held the security portfolio in the caretaker government and helped mediate trade talks with the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He faces the tricky task of balancing regional relations after ties with neighbour India soured during the interim government, and Dhaka deepened engagement with New Delhi’s arch-enemy Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In separate posts on X, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar conveyed his “heartiest congratulations” to Khalilur Rahman and State Minister for Foreign Affairs Shama Obaed Islam on their appointments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am confident that his vast diplomatic experience and commitment to regional peace, stability and connectivity will greatly benefit the people of Bangladesh, the region, and beyond,” Dar said about his counterpart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to working closely with him to further deepen the brotherly ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh, and to advance mutually beneficial bilateral and multilateral cooperation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the state minister, Dar expressed his wish to work closely with her to further strengthen Pakistan-Bangladesh relations and to advance “regional peace, stability, and mutually beneficial cooperation in areas of shared interest”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s Minister of External Affairs Subrahmanyam Jaishankar congratulated his counterpart, saying in a statement that they would work together to “advance our cooperation”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PM Rahman was expected to chair his first cabinet meeting later on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other members of the cabinet include veteran politicians, former ministers and lawmakers, as well as academics and several party workers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Nations from Algeria to Zimbabwe, Arab League, OIC and EU take issue with unilateral decisions aimed at expanding unlawful Israeli presence&lt;br /&gt;• Israeli NGO warns against expansion of settlements ‘into Jerusalem’&lt;br /&gt;• Imam of Al Aqsa barred from entering mosque compound&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM: As Israeli authorities barred the imam of Al Aqsa Mosque from entering the compound, 93 states — including the eight-nation Muslim bloc — slammed Tel Aviv’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973604&quot;&gt;move&lt;/a&gt; to designate lands in the occupied West Bank as so-called “state land”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the Israeli cabinet approved measures that would increase Israeli civilian authority in Areas A and B of the West Bank, which together constitute roughly 40 per cent of the territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israeli NGOs have also raised alarm over the government’s settlement plan, which they say would mark the first expansion of Jerusalem’s borders into the occupied West Bank since 1967.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement, issued by the Palestinian mission to the United Nations, 85 nations as well as the European Union (EU), Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and Arab League called for the immediate reversal of the Israeli annexation of the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;States who signed up to the latest statement include Algeria, Andorra, Australia, Austria, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belarus, Belgium, Brazil, Brunei, Canada, Chad, China, Colombia, Cuba, Cyprus, North Korea, Denmark, Djibouti, Egypt, El Salvador, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Guyana, Iceland, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lebanon, Liberia, Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Mauritania, Mauritius, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Namibia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, South Korea, Russia, San Marino, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Somalia, South Africa, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, Switzerland, Syria, Tajikistan, The Gambia, Turkiye, Uganda, UAE, Tanzania, UK, Uruguay, Vanuatu, Venezuela, Yemen and Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Palestine_UN/status/2023852371454124361&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An earlier statement from the foreign ministers of the eight-nation Muslim bloc also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973896&quot;&gt;condemned&lt;/a&gt; Israel for approving procedures for the registration and settlement of land ownership across extensive areas of the occupied West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This illegal step constitutes a grave escalation aimed at accelerating illegal settlement activity, land confiscation, entrenching Israeli control, and applying unlawful Israeli sovereignty over the Occupied Palestinian Territory and undermining the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people,” said the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This step reflects an attempt to impose a new legal and administrative reality designed to consolidate control over the occupied land, thereby undermining the two-state solution, eroding the prospects for the establishment of an independent and viable Palestinian State, and jeopardising the attainment of a just and comprehensive peace in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning by NGOs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned development, announced by Israel’s Ministry of Construction and Housing, is formally a westward expansion of the Geva Binyamin, or Adam, settlement situated north-east of Jerusalem in the West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the area to be developed lies on the Israeli side of the separation barrier built in the early 2000s, while Geva Binyamin sits on the West Bank side of the barrier, and the two are separated by a road. In a statement, Israeli settlement watchdog Peace Now said there would be no “territorial or functional connection” between the area to be developed and the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The new neighbourhood will be integral to the city of Jerusalem,” said Lior Amihai, Peace Now’s executive director.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What is unique about that one is that it will be connected directly to Jerusalem, but it will be beyond the annexed municipal border. So it will be in complete West Bank territory, but just adjacent to Jerusalem,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Imam barred from Al Aqsa&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheikh Muhammad Al-Abbasi, a senior imam of the Al Aqsa Mosque in east Jerusalem, said on Tuesday that Israeli authorities had barred him from entering the compound, just days before the start of the holy month of Ramazan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have been barred from the mosque for a week, and the order can be renewed,” he said, adding that he was not informed of the reason for the ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Israeli police said they had recommended issuing 10,000 permits for Palestinians from the occupied West Bank, who require special permission to enter Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Tarique Rahman sworn in as Bangladesh’s PM after landslide election victory</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973874/tarique-rahman-sworn-in-as-bangladeshs-pm-after-landslide-election-victory</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; was sworn in as Bangladesh’s prime minister on Tuesday, marking a decisive political shift in the South Asian nation after his party’s sweeping parliamentary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890&quot;&gt;election victory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, 60, son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and assassinated President Ziaur Rahman, takes office facing urgent challenges, including restoring political stability, rebuilding investor confidence, and reviving key industries such as the garment sector after the prolonged turmoil that followed the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;Gen Z-led uprising&lt;/a&gt; that toppled &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955643&quot;&gt;Sheikh Hasina’s&lt;/a&gt; government in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interim administration led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus ran the country through the transitional period leading up to the election.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube_short  media__item--relative&quot;&gt;    &lt;div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking with tradition, the swearing-in ceremony was held under the open sky at the South Plaza of the Jatiya Sangsad Bhaban, the national parliament building, instead of the Bangabhaban, the president’s official residence, where such events are usually organised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Mohammed Shahabuddin officiated as Rahman and his cabinet took their oaths in the presence of senior political figures, diplomats, civil and military officials, and representatives from invited countries, including China, India and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman’s BNP secured a commanding two-thirds majority, returning to power after nearly two decades. The Jamaat-i-Islami, contesting its first election since a 2013 ban was lifted following Hasina’s ouster, won a record 68 seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina’s Awami League party was banned from contesting after its registration was revoked by the Election Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat and its allies, including the National Citizen Party, led by youth activists who played a prominent role in the movement that toppled Hasina, will form the opposition.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman’s elevation caps a long and turbulent political journey. He returned to Bangladesh last year after 17 years of self-imposed exile in London, arriving shortly before his mother’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivals have long criticised his political record, pointing to corruption allegations he denies, but his return energised party supporters and reshaped the BNPs campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his first remarks after the election, Rahman urged calm and restraint, saying: Peace, law and order must be maintained at any cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He called on supporters to avoid retaliation, warning: We will not tolerate any kind of chaos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Rahman and lawmakers were sworn into parliament on Tuesday, becoming the first elected representatives since a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850190&quot;&gt;deadly&lt;/a&gt; 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850304&quot;&gt;uprising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers, who promised loyalty to Bangladesh, were sworn in by the Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahman’s win marks a remarkable turnaround, with the BNP coalition winning 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat, which secured more than a quarter of seats in parliament — a four-fold increase on its previous best — has challenged results in 32 constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jamaat leader Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has also said the party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only seven women were directly elected, although a further 50 seats reserved for women will be allocated to parties according to their share of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four members of minority communities won seats, including two Hindus — a population that makes up roughly seven per cent in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has so far responded to the results with relative calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the BNP can do a good job with the economy, it will make everything else easier for the government,” Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will help to create a level of stability, to tackle the many other challenges beyond the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#pakistan-congratulates-rahman&quot; id=&quot;pakistan-congratulates-rahman&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Pakistan congratulates Rahman&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Rahman’s oath-taking, President Asif Ali Zardari congratulated him on becoming the prime minister and his party on its “decisive victory” in the elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A post by the President’s Secretariat on social media platform X said Zardari also appreciated the interim government’s role “in a peaceful [and] fair election” and conveyed “best wishes for stability and prosperity”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president “hopes for stronger Pakistan-Bangladesh ties and regional peace”, the post said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif extended warm felicitations to Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I look forward to close and meaningful engagements with my brother, to further strengthen our bilateral cooperation across mutually beneficial areas and to deepen the historic ties between our two countries,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who was visiting Dhaka for the swearing-in ceremony, conveyed best wishes and prayers for Rahman in “steering the country towards new heights of progress and development”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was an honour to witness and be part of this historic moment in the history of Bangladesh on behalf of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the people of Pakistan,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iqbal also met Rahman after the latter’s oath-taking, with a PID press release stating that the Pakistani minister conveyed “warm congratulations on behalf of the government and people of Pakistan” to the new prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He extended best wishes for the peace, progress and prosperity of Bangladesh under Rahman’s leadership, the press release said, adding that during the meeting, Iqbal also conveyed a formal invitation from the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif to Rahman to undertake an official visit to Pakistan at a mutually convenient date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two leaders discussed avenues to reinvigorate bilateral relations and enhance regional cooperation,” the press release further stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said Iqbal emphasised the need to revive SAARC to promote regional connectivity and advance a shared geo-economic vision for South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He noted that South Asia has remained one of the least integrated regions due to historical conflicts, and underscored that Pakistan and Bangladesh, through mutual collaboration, could help pave the way for a more integrated and economically vibrant South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the importance of knowledge partnerships, Iqbal proposed the establishment of a “Pakistan–Bangladesh Knowledge Corridor” to strengthen academic, research and technological collaboration, the press release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He informed Rahman that the Chairman of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) of Pakistan would be directed to visit Bangladesh to explore twin-university agreements and promote student and faculty exchange programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iqbal stressed that youth exchange “is crucial for building long-term partnerships” and announced enhanced academic cooperation, including scholarship opportunities. He said that 500 scholarships had been allocated for Bangladeshi students, with 75 students already proceeding to Pakistan for higher education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides also discussed collaboration between institutions including the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), and their Bangladeshi counterparts to exchange expertise in data systems, digital governance, and institutional capacity building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Iqbal further highlighted opportunities for cooperation in SMEs and cottage industries, noting that by leveraging their combined populations, Pakistan and Bangladesh could secure a greater share in global markets for technology-enabled services, manufacturing, and production of goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expanding direct flight operations and improving connectivity were also discussed as important steps to facilitate trade, tourism, business-to-business engagement, and people-to-people contacts, the press release said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said Iqbal also proposed the revival of the Iqbal Academy and suggested joint celebrations of the 150th birth anniversary of Allama Muhammad Iqbal next year, as a symbol of shared intellectual and cultural heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both leaders reaffirmed their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties and working together for regional peace, stability, and shared prosperity, according to the press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, the minister had met with Mohammad Yunus, who was serving as the country’s interim leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I warmly congratulated Professor Yunus and the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of elections and the historic democratic transition. I conveyed Pakistan’s sincere good wishes for continued stability, progress, and prosperity for Bangladesh under its new leadership,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further said that the discussions focused on “opening a new, forward-looking chapter in Pakistan–Bangladesh relations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I expressed appreciation for the positive momentum in bilateral ties, including growing trade engagement, revival of direct air connectivity, and renewed people-to-people contacts. We agreed that the current regional and geopolitical environment demands greater economic cooperation, connectivity, and collaboration between our two countries,” Iqbal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also acknowledged Yunus’s global contributions to social entrepreneurship and inclusive development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I extended an invitation for him to visit Pakistan so that we may further institutionalise cooperation in areas of shared interest, particularly youth empowerment, innovation, and sustainable development,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan and Bangladesh share deep cultural, historical, and social affinities. It is time to transform these affinities into structured economic partnerships, academic exchanges, and regional cooperation. Our future lies in building connectivity, expanding trade, empowering youth, and shaping a stable and prosperous South Asia together,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Muslims follow the lunar calendar, which consists of 12 months lasting between 29 and 30 days. The start of the fasting month of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/2024-ramadan-when-starts-why-muslims-fast&quot;&gt;Ramadan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;depends on the sighting of the crescent moon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi authorities said on Tuesday evening that the moon had been spotted by their teams, and therefore the fasting month would begin on Wednesday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uae&quot;&gt;UAE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/qatar&quot;&gt;Qatar&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/bahrain&quot;&gt;Bahrain&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/kuwait&quot;&gt;Kuwait&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/yemen&quot;&gt;Yemen&lt;/a&gt;, Afghanistan and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/palestine&quot;&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt; announced that they would commence on Wednesday too. Sunni religious authorities in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iraq&quot;&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/lebanon&quot;&gt;Lebanon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;also said Ramadan was beginning that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A string of other Muslim-majority countries said they would begin on Thursday, having not sighted the moon, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt&quot;&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;, Brunei, Malaysia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, Indonesia, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/tunisia&quot;&gt;Tunisia&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/libya&quot;&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/jordan&quot;&gt;Jordan&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/syria&quot;&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/oman&quot;&gt;Oman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several countries outside of the Muslim world also will begin on Thursday, including the Phillipines, Japan, Singapore, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/france&quot;&gt;France&lt;/a&gt; and Australia.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The office of Ayatollah Ali Sistani, the most senior Shia authority in Iraq, said Ramadan will start on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iran&quot;&gt;Iran&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/morocco&quot;&gt;Morocco&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/india&quot;&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, Bangladesh and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/pakistan&quot;&gt;Pakistan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;are among a number of countries that will make announcements on Wednesday as to whether Ramadan will begin on Thursday or Friday. These countries are expected to begin the month on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Spotting the crescent moon&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, Saudi Arabia - home to Islam’s holiest sites - has reported some of its sightings of the crescent moon on days when scientists and astronomers insisted it would be impossible to see it. Saudi authorities have not addressed these criticisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia uses a calendar called the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ummulqura.org.sa/yearcalender.aspx?y=1446&amp;amp;l=True&quot;&gt;Umm al-Qura&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on calculations and marks key dates years in advance. For this year’s Ramadan, the calendar had marked it as starting on Wednesday 18 February.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month in the UAE, the Sharjah Academy for Astronomy, Space Sciences and Technology (SAASST) at the University of Sharjah &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khaleejtimes.com/uae/sharjah-astronomy-experts-calculation-ramadan-crescent-sighting-2026&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would be scientifically impossible to sight the crescent moon on Tuesday 17 February - even using new technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SAASST had said the first day of Ramadan would be Thursday 19 February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Separately, Abu Dhabi-based astronomer Mohammad Odeh, director of the International Astronomical Centre in Abu Dhabi and the Islamic Crescents Observation Project, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.khaleejtimes.com/uae/ramadan-2026-warning-against-false-moon-sighting-information?_refresh=true&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the moon will not be visible on Tuesday in the UAE or Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Such reports, if they do occur, definitively confirm the error some individuals may make in mistakenly believing they have sighted a crescent moon that is not present in the sky,&quot; Odeh said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE and many other Muslim-majority countries, especially in the Gulf region, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/eid-2025-does-saudi-arabia-report-impossible-moonsightings&quot;&gt;customarily&lt;/a&gt; follow Saudi Arabia&apos;s lead with its moon-sightings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the comments from Emirati experts about the impossibility of a sighting, the UAE announced Ramadan for Wednesday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many experts had predicted that Saudi Arabia would declare Ramadan beginning on Wednesday regardless, as they have often announced sightings in previous years despite astronomers insisting the moon was not visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imad Ahmed, founder and director of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/newcrescentsociety/&quot;&gt;New Crescent Society&lt;/a&gt;, an astronomy society that specialises in the Islamic calendar in the UK, runs an astronomy programme with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/planetarium-shows/astronomy-islam&quot;&gt;Royal Observatory in Greenwich&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;On Tuesday 17 February 2026, the crescent moon is astronomically impossible to see, whether by high powered telescopes or by the unaided eye anywhere in the Middle East - indeed, in the whole of Asia, Africa, or Europe,&quot; he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/will-uae-break-saudi-arabia-ramadan-start-date-moon-sighting&quot;&gt;told Middle East Eye last week&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His Majesty’s Nautical Almanac Office in the UK, a government body that produces astronomical data, said the moon would &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/world-news/ramadan-2026-moonsighting-predictions-point-33407093&quot;&gt;not be visible&lt;/a&gt; in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in countries without official moon-sighting bodies, like the UK, many Muslims also follow Saudi Arabia’s lead, although some religious scholars in the Gulf kingdom have urged people elsewhere not to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increasing numbers of British Muslims are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/eid-2025-does-saudi-arabia-report-impossible-moonsightings&quot;&gt;opting&lt;/a&gt; for local moon sightings. Ahmed’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://newcrescentsociety.org/&quot;&gt;New Crescent Society&lt;/a&gt; carries out sightings across the country and aims to gather support for a unified Islamic calendar for Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observant Muslims abstain from all forms of food and drink between the hours of dawn and sunset whilst trying to reconnect with their faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, Middle East Eye answers some of the most asked questions about the holy month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What is Ramadan and why do Muslims fast?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar and amongst the most sacred for Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the month, Muslims are expected to fast if they are healthy and able to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam and forms a core part of the religion. The other pillars are the declaration of faith, prayer, giving charity and going on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/hajj&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Hajj&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;pilgrimage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;&apos;Not even water?&apos;: Five Ramadan questions you may be too embarrassed to ask&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/ramadan-questions-not-even-water-too-embarrassed-ask&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims believe that through fasting they are able to strengthen their relationship with God. Time is spent participating in acts of worship, such as praying, reading the Quran and giving charity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abstaining from food and drink during daylight hours allows Muslims to practise willpower and focus their energy on working on their faith. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fasting also allows Muslims to empathise with those who are less fortunate, and be more compassionate to those in need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are numerous ways a fast can be invalidated, including intentionally eating or drinking, intercourse and smoking. A woman cannot fast if she is menstruating.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One question most Muslims get asked during Ramadan (alongside the infamous gasp of&amp;nbsp; &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/ramadan-questions-not-even-water-too-embarrassed-ask&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;not even water&lt;/a&gt;?&quot;) is what happens if you eat or drink by mistake? Can you not just take a sneaky swig when no one is looking?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eating or drinking intentionally invalidates your fast, as the purpose of Ramadan is to practise self-restraint and engage in religious acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, eating or drinking, if it is done through a genuine mistake, does not nullify your fast: followers can continue fasting as normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Why does the date of Ramadan change each year?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Islam adheres to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/islamic-calendar-how-does-it-work-and-how-does-it-differ#:~:text=The%20Islamic%20calendar%20is%20governed,of%20a%20new%20crescent%20moon.&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;lunar calendar&lt;/a&gt;. This means that the month of Ramadan begins when the first crescent of a new&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/ramadan-moon-sighting-saudi-arabia-uk-muslims&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;moon is sighted&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-mee-life mee-readmore-type-image align-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/islamic-calendar-how-does-it-work-and-how-does-it-differ&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;alt&quot; class=&quot;mee-readmore-image&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/moon-ramadan-afp.jpg.webp?itok=Msjhw9Q1&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;The Islamic calendar: How does it work and why is it lunar?&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/islamic-calendar-how-does-it-work-and-how-does-it-differ&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lunar calendar is 10 to 11 days shorter than the modern 365-day Gregorian calendar, which is based on the Earth&apos;s rotation around the sun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This difference means Ramadan begins on a different day each year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Muslim-majority countries, dedicated state committees check for the crescent moon and officially announce the start of Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile in non-Muslim majority countries, there are different approaches: some Muslims follow a national mosque or reputable Islamic authority, whilst others follow the decision taken by Muslim-majority countries such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/saudi-arabia&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan or India.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;When will it start this year?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia, Qatar and several other Gulf countries claimed to have sighted the crescent moon on 17 February and declared 18 February as the first day of Ramadan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, Egypt, Turkey Jordan and some other countries said the crescent moon was not sighted and therefore announced that Ramadan would begin on Thursday 19 February.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that the month of fasting will likely end on either Wednesday 18 March or Thursday 19 March, as there are either 29 or 30 days in a lunar month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, Eid al-Fitr, the festival of breaking the fast, is likely to fall on either Thursday 19 March or Friday 20 March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eid al-Fitr marks the end of Ramadan. Muslims tend to celebrate Eid with a small breakfast and give to charity before Eid prayers in congregation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How long will Muslims be fasting for this year?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of each day&apos;s fast varies from place to place, depending on the number of daylight hours. It also varies with the time of year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take northern&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/tags/norway&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Norway&lt;/a&gt;: if Ramadan falls one year in December, then each day&apos;s fast will be very short due to the limited amount of daylight near the North Pole at this time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the hours of fasting will increase in the same place during the summer, when there is near-perpetual daylight. In such circumstances there are rulings that allow for the local Muslim population to follow the hours of the nearest Muslim country or Mecca, home to Islam&apos;s holiest site, in&amp;nbsp;Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, each day of fasting can be as short as 11 hours or as long as 20 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Muslims in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, for instance those in London, can expect to fast between 12 hours at the start of Ramadan to 14 hours &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.almustafatrust.org/ramadan-timetable-2026/&quot;&gt;by the end&lt;/a&gt;, while in Ottawa,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/topics/canada&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;they will be fasting more than 14 hours, whereas in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/tags/south-africa-1211294169&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;South Africa&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;fasting time will be about 12 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;How do Muslims prepare for Ramadan?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every family prepares for Ramadan differently. It is often a time for family and friends to get together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many will host&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/tags/iftar&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;iftars&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;- the meal which breaks the fast at the end of the day - at home and invite friends. Mosques typically host open iftars when anybody can come by and eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;alt&quot; height=&quot;15&quot; src=&quot;data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAPABAP///wAAACH5BAEKAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAICRAEAOw==&quot; title=&quot;Click and drag to move&quot; width=&quot;15&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Many Muslims try to break bad habits before the start of Ramadan, to ease themselves into the month, prepare spiritually and take part in more charitable acts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What happens on a typical day during Ramadan?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the month of Ramadan, Muslims will wake before the sun rises to eat a pre-dawn meal called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/ramadan-suhoor-pre-dawn-meal-closer-look&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;suhoor&lt;/a&gt;. They will then not eat or drink until sunset, when they will have iftar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iftar is followed by optional nightly prayers, known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-new-york-city-ramadan-tarawih-prayer-times-square&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tarawih&lt;/a&gt;, which go on into the night, if not into the early hours of the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prayers usually take place at the mosque in large congregations but Muslims have the option to pray at home too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What are some key Ramadan traditions?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each day’s fast is typically broken by eating dates, which follows the tradition of the prophet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, people will pray Maghrib - one of the five daily prayers - and then sit down to eat.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some countries, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/egypt&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/turkey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/features/meet-cairos-mesaharati-spirit-ramadan-beats-womans-drums&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;musaharati&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;will go down the streets with a drum to wake people for the pre-dawn meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What else are Muslims expected to do during Ramadan?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the holy month, Muslims are expected to engage in charitable acts, one of which is the obligatory zakat al-fitr, which is given at the end of Ramadan but before the Eid prayer (see below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The significance of the donation is to cleanse the donor from any shortcomings conducted during the month and provide food for the needy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This payment is different to the zakat, which can be given at any time of year. It is one of the five pillars of Islam and equates to 2.5 percent of a full year&apos;s savings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In many Middle Eastern countries, Ramadan is prime time for the year&apos;s best&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/ramadan-arab-tv-shows-six-things-learned&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TV series&lt;/a&gt;, showcasing the most dramatic storylines and top celebrities, capitalising on the time people spend waiting for iftar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, many people choose the holy month to reduce the hours spent on entertainment, preferring instead to focus on studying the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 10 days of Ramadan are especially revered, with a focus on intense worship, as the first verses of the Quran were revealed to the Prophet Muhammad during this period, which is&amp;nbsp;known as Laylat al-Qadr, Arabic for &quot;night of decree&quot; or &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/islam-laylat-qadr-night-power-holiest-night-explained&quot; style=&quot;background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;night of power&lt;/a&gt;&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the prophet never specified the exact date of the night, Muslims use those 10 days to increase their spirituality by reading and studying the Quran.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sacredness of Laylat al-Qadr is mentioned in the Quran, where it states that Laylat al-Qadr is better than a thousand months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worshippers believe that praying with sincerity will allow their previous sins to be forgiven&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some Muslims choose to live and sleep in a mosque during this period - known as i&apos;tikaaf - to focus on increasing their religious knowledge, staying in separate parts according to gender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;What happens at the end of Ramadan?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the holy month there is a three-day celebration known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/discover/eid-al-fitr-2022-islam-muslims-end-of-ramadan&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Eid al-Fitr&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or, more commonly, Eid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Families will typically wake up early to go and pray in the mosque and greet friends, family and others in the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a time of food and festivities, when young children receive presents and homes are decorated to mark the occasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Others also use the occasion to visit graveyards and pay their respects to loved ones who have passed away.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh’s new prime minister, political heir Tarique Rahman</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973905/bangladeshs-new-prime-minister-political-heir-tarique-rahman</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Long overshadowed by his parents and heir to one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties, the country’s new prime minister, Tarique Rahman has finally stepped into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At 60, the leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) takes charge of the South Asian nation of 170 million, driven by what he calls an ambition to “do better”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year-and-a-half after the deadly uprising that toppled previous prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s iron-fisted rule, the BNP won a “sweeping victory” in parliamentary elections on February 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973874/tarique-rahman-sworn-in-as-bangladeshs-pm-after-landslide-election-victory&quot;&gt;sworn in&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday, leading a more than two-thirds majority in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This victory belongs to people who aspire to and have sacrificed for democracy,” he said in a speech.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube_short  media__item--relative&quot;&gt;    &lt;div&gt;
        
    &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His rise marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Widely known as Tarique Zia, he carries a political name that has shaped every stage of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was 15 when his father, President Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarique’s mother, Khaleda Zia — a three-time prime minister and a towering figure in Bangladeshi politics for decades — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;died aged 80 in December&lt;/a&gt;, just days after his return home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#my-country&quot; id=&quot;my-country&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘My country’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, speaking to &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; just before the vote, vowed to build on their legacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are them, I am me,” he said from his office, beneath gold-framed portraits of his late parents. “I will try to do better than them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He described the “mixed feelings” that overwhelmed him when he arrived home in December — the joy of returning, swiftly eclipsed by grief at his mother’s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of celebrating, however, he had to bid farewell to his ailing mother, who had long been in intensive care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you come home after so long, any son wants to hug his mother,” he said. “I didn’t have that chance.” Within days of landing in Dhaka, the still grieving heir assumed leadership of the BNP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#unnerves-many&quot; id=&quot;unnerves-many&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Unnerves many’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born when the country was still East Pakistan, he was briefly detained as a child during the 1971 war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His party hails him as “one of the youngest prisoners of war”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His father, Ziaur Rahman, an army commander, gained influence months after a 1975 coup when founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman — Sheikh Hasina’s father — was murdered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It entrenched a rivalry between the two families that would define the country’s politics for decades. Ziaur Rahman himself was killed in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman grew up in his mother’s political orbit as she went on to become the country’s first female prime minister, alternating power with Hasina in a long and bitter duel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In her seats, I used to go and I used to campaign,” Rahman said. “So this is how slowly and gradually I started getting involved in politics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But his career has also been shadowed by allegations of corruption and abuse of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2006 US embassy cable said he “inspires few but unnerves many”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other cables labelled him a “symbol of kleptocratic government and violent politics” and accused him of being “phenomenally corrupt”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrested on corruption charges in 2007, Rahman says he was tortured in custody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He fled to London the following year, where he faced multiple cases in absentia. He denied all charges and dismissed them as politically motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he also told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; he offered an apology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If there are any mistakes which were unwanted, we are sorry for that,” he told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;Hasina’s fall&lt;/a&gt;, Rahman was acquitted of the most serious charge against him — a life sentence handed down in absentia for a 2004 grenade attack on a Hasina rally — which he had always denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Married to a cardiologist and father to a daughter, a lawyer, he led a quiet life in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That changed with his dramatic return in December, accompanied by his fluffy ginger cat, Zebu, images of which went viral on Bangladeshi social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He admits the task ahead is now “immense”, rebuilding a country he says was “destroyed” by the former government.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Under the BNP, particularly during Khaleda Zia’s rule, four major anti-India terrorist camps were being run in the Chittagong Hill Tracts. Notably, these terrorist training camps had Al Qaeda and Pakistan ISI/military instructors. As a young officer, Pervez Musharraf (later president of Pakistan) also served as an instructor in these terrorist training camps. To assume that the radical elements of the BNP will not be in league with the JeI will be the height of naviete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh PM-to-be Tarique Rahman and lawmakers sworn into parliament</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973874/bangladesh-pm-to-be-tarique-rahman-and-lawmakers-sworn-into-parliament</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s prime minister-to-be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; and lawmakers were sworn into parliament on Tuesday, becoming the first elected representatives since a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850190&quot;&gt;deadly&lt;/a&gt; 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850304&quot;&gt;uprising&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman is set to take over from an interim government that has steered the country of 170 million people for 18 months since the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;overthrown&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers, who promised loyalty to Bangladesh, were sworn in by the Chief Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) lawmakers are expected to formally elect Rahman as their leader, with President Mohammed Shahabuddin then to administer the oath of office to the prime minister and his ministers later on Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, 60, chief of the BNP and scion of one of the country’s most powerful political dynasties, won a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890/bangladeshs-bnp-wins-sweeping-election-majority-promises-stability&quot;&gt;landslide victory&lt;/a&gt; in the February 12 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/early-counts-show-bnp-ahead-in-bangladesh-election-after-strong-turnout&quot;&gt;elections&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy,” he said in his victory speech on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This victory belongs to people who aspire to and have sacrificed for democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he has also warned of the challenges ahead, including tackling the economic woes of the world’s second-largest garment exporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by the authoritarian regime, weakened constitutional and statutory institutions, and a deteriorating law and order situation”, he added in his victory speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new leader has pledged to restore stability and revive growth after months of turmoil that rattled investor confidence in the world’s second-largest &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1853189&quot;&gt;garment exporter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has also called for all parties to “remain united” in a country polarised by years of bitter rivalry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#peaceful-opposition&quot; id=&quot;peaceful-opposition&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Peaceful opposition’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman’s win marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP coalition won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat, which secured more than a quarter of seats in parliament — a four-fold increase on its previous best — has challenged results in 32 constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jamaat leader Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has also said the party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina’s Awami League party &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951958/bangladeshs-sheikh-hasina-warns-of-mass-voter-boycott-as-her-party-barred-from-election&quot;&gt;was barred&lt;/a&gt; from taking part in the elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, 78, who was sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal” election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But India praised the BNP’s “decisive win” — a notable shift after deeply strained ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only seven women were directly elected, although a further 50 seats reserved for women will be allocated to parties according to their share of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four members of minority communities won seats, including two Hindus — a population that makes up roughly seven per cent in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has so far responded to the results with relative calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the BNP can do a good job with the economy, it will make everything else easier for the government,” Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will help to create a level of stability, to tackle the many other challenges beyond the economy.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh is transitioning to a new political era with the BNP&apos;s victory. Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus will step down as Chief Adviser. His future role remains undefined, though some suggest advisory capacities. Yunus himself expresses no political interest, aiming to return to his social business work. The new government faces significant challenges ahead.</description>

      <description>In a surprising development, Dr. Nasimul Gani, a known ideologue of Hizbut Tahrir, is set to take on the role of Cabinet Secretary in Bangladesh&apos;s interim government. This decision comes just before Tarique Rahman’s official inauguration as Prime Minister. Gani&apos;s background invites scrutiny regarding potential implications for regional security, particularly with another aide, Mahfuz Alam, labeled as a HuT affiliate.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus stepped down on Monday in a farewell broadcast to the nation, before handing over the reins to an elected government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, the interim government is stepping down,” the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner said. “But let the practice of democracy, freedom of speech, and fundamental rights that has begun not be halted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus returned from self-imposed exile in August 2024, days after the iron-fisted government of Sheikh Hasina was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;overthrown&lt;/a&gt; by a student-led uprising, and she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief#:~:text=Hasina%20flees%20to%20India&quot;&gt;fled &lt;/a&gt;by helicopter to India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was the day of great liberation,” he said. “What a day of joy it was! Bangladeshis across the world shed tears of happiness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has led Bangladesh as its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;chief adviser&lt;/a&gt; since, and now hands over power after congratulating the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its leader Tarique Rahman on a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890&quot;&gt;landslide victory&lt;/a&gt;” in elections last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The people, voters, political parties, and stakeholder institutions linked to the election have set a commendable example,” Yunus said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This election has set a benchmark for future elections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, 60, chief of the BNP and scion of one of the country’s most powerful political dynasties, will lead the South Asian nation of 170 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#rebuilt-institutions&quot; id=&quot;rebuilt-institutions&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Rebuilt institutions’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi voters endorsed sweeping democratic reforms in a national referendum, a key pillar of Yunus’s post-uprising transition agenda, on the same day as the elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lengthy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1949661&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt;, known as the “July Charter” after the month when the uprising that toppled Hasina began, proposes term limits for prime ministers, the creation of an upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We did not start from zero — we started from a deficit,” he said. “Sweeping away the ruins, we rebuilt institutions and set the course for reforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referendum noted that approval would make the charter “binding on the parties that win” the election, obliging them to endorse it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, several parties raised questions before the vote, and the reforms will still require ratification by the new parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman conceded on Saturday, saying his party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly elected lawmakers are expected to be sworn in on Tuesday, after which Tarique Rahman is set to become Bangladesh’s next prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police records show that political clashes during the campaign period killed five people and injured more than 600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has responded to the results with relative calm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The far-right Restore Britain party was launched on Friday night in Great Yarmouth by former Reform MP Rupert Lowe and has been endorsed by Elon Musk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowe, a millionaire businessman and farmer who used to be chairman of Southampton FC, released an &quot;immigration policy&quot;, which he called &quot;deportation poetry&quot;, over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He pledged to close off visa routes for &quot;Albania, Pakistan, Somalia, Eritrea, Afghanistan and plenty more&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will discriminate,&quot; Lowe proclaimed. &quot;We will look at the facts, and then discriminate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Lowe&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023386586864386140?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the party would &quot;abolish the entire asylum systems&quot;, adding: &quot;No more asylum seekers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party has &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RestoreBritain_/status/2023306233219068141?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it has more than 50,000 members already. Over the weekend, Lowe &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2022580807336911236?s=20&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that a Restore Britain government would ban non-stun halal and kosher slaughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In Britain, we treat our animals with care - we do not brutally butcher them alive,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, the MP was widely criticised after&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/rupert-lowe-admits-putting-down-labrador-with-shotgun-b1234246.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revealing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;he asked his gamekeeper to shoot his 17-year-old dog in the back of the head at his estate in Gloucestershire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the dog, Cromwell, could no longer use his back legs and described his decision as &quot;humane&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&apos;Cousin marriages will be outlawed&apos;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowe was suspended from Reform in March last year after&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/21/rupert-lowe-antisemitic-remark-parliament-meeting-reform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;calling&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;it a &quot;protest party led by the Messiah&quot; and criticising Farage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the MP &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023304275217072259?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on X: &quot;Cousin marriages will be outlawed, so don’t even try and bring your wifecousin in from Pakistan. Not happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;Restore Britain will not be putting forward any Bangladeshi candidates, I promise you that&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;- Rupert Lowe MP&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;But if a British man wants to bring his American wife to Britain in order to build a life together, then we will encourage and enable that,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MP &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023304275217072259?s=20&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; a selective easing of &quot;fees and rules around spouse visas&quot; that would not apply to people from &quot;Pakistan, Albania, Bangladesh, Somalia, Afghanistan and many, many more&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023083380716327408?s=20&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; for a &quot;total ban on all foreigners voting, or standing in elections&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Restore Britain will not be putting forward any Bangladeshi candidates, I promise you that,&quot; he added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the party&apos;s campaigns director and spokesman, Charlie Downes, became embroiled in a social media argument with Matt Goodwin, Reform&apos;s parliamentary candidate in the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downes &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/GoodwinMJ/status/2023340610548105694?s=20&quot;&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; Reform of deploying &quot;Regime attack lines when their electoral prospects are threatened by an authentically anti-establishment offering,&quot; after Goodwin criticised a far-right X account for mocking Sikh supporters of Reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Downes, Goodwin &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/GoodwinMJ/status/2023340610548105694?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;You and many Restore people around you appear to be advocating blatant racism, calling to not just deport illegal migrants and foreign criminals (which is Reform policy) but throw out settled Brits who work hard, pay taxes, and play by the rules.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: &quot;Your ecosystem is riddled with white supremacists, antisemites, racists and conspiracy theorists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodwin himself has a long record of making controversial comments about ethnicity and Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most contentiously, he has repeatedly&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/jan/27/matthew-goodwin-gorton-and-denton-reform-uk-minorities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;insisted&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that British-born people with immigrant parents are not necessarily British.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advance UK, led by former Reform deputy leader Ben Habib and backed by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/feb/15/rupert-lowe-great-yarmouth-first-party-far-right-reform-uk&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it will consider a merger with Lowe&apos;s Restore Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restore Britain has said it will act as an umbrella political party that partners with locally based political parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party could cause a headache for Farage and his Reform party by splitting the anti-immigration vote in many constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is necessary for Britain will be incredibly painful,&quot; Lowe &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023155273704103976?s=20&quot;&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. &quot;This is going to be the fight of our lives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In meeting with Naqvi, Sri Lankan president appreciates Pakistan’s support during ‘difficult times’</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973707/in-meeting-with-naqvi-sri-lankan-president-appreciates-pakistans-support-during-difficult-times</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: In a meeting with a delegation from Pakistan on Monday, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appreciated Islamabad’s support during “difficult times”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sri Lankan president shared photos of the meeting held in Colombo on social media platform X, saying that he had met Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development Chaudhry Salik Hussain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We reaffirmed our enduring friendship [and] appreciated Pakistan’s support to Sri Lanka during difficult times,” the post by Dissanayake said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anuradisanayake/status/2023376056657559557&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further stated that the “Pakistan delegation conveyed special thanks from Pakistan’s president and prime minister for Sri Lanka’s timely intervention when Pakistan’s participation in the T20 [World Cup] was uncertain”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days ahead of the ongoing T20 global showpiece, the Pakistan government had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; that the country’s cricket team would not play against India in the group-stage match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision had come after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/in-phone-call-with-pm-sri-lanka-president-urges-pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-clash-against-india&quot;&gt;withdrew its decision&lt;/a&gt; to boycott the India match on February 9, saying: “The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the Bangladesh Cricket Board, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the withdrawal, PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Dissanayake. The Sri Lankan president urged Pakistan to play the match against India, in response to which PM Shehbaz said he would inform him about a “final decision” regarding the match after consultations, state-run &lt;em&gt;PTV News&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after Pakistan announced its decision to play the match, Dissanayake thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said in a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#joint-strategy-against-cybercrime-financial-fraud-mafia&quot; id=&quot;joint-strategy-against-cybercrime-financial-fraud-mafia&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Joint strategy against cybercrime, financial fraud mafia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Pakistan and Sri Lanka agreed to develop a joint strategy against cybercrimes and financial fraud mafias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The understanding was reached during a meeting of Naqvi with his Sri Lankan counterpart, Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijepala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a handout released by the Interior Ministry’s media wing, the meeting focused on strengthening bilateral cooperation and matters of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Ministers also discussed ways to enhance cooperation in internal security and joint efforts in counterterrorism and anti-narcotics operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‎It was agreed to strengthen institutional collaboration between the interior ministries of Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The two sides also decided to improve coordination to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matters relating to joint training programs for police and paramilitary forces were also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi offered training opportunities for Sri Lankan police officers at the National Police Academy of Pakistan. He stated that officer exchange programs would enhance the professional capacity of forces in both countries and open new avenues of cooperation between the two ministries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also emphasised the need to expand collaboration to effectively combat cybercrime and financial crimes. Naqvi also invited the Sri Lankan minister to visit Pakistan and expressed gratitude for the warm hospitality extended to him during his visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sri Lankan minister welcomed Naqvi, stating that it was a matter of great pleasure for Sri Lanka and affirmed their commitment to promoting cooperation with Pakistan in areas of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#security-cooperation&quot; id=&quot;security-cooperation&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Security cooperation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi also met with Sri Lanka’s Secretary of Defence Air Vice Marshal (Retd.) Sampatha Thuyacontha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting included discussions on Pakistan–Sri Lanka security cooperation and defence matters. Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to further enhance bilateral security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‎The defence secretary acknowledged that Sri Lanka had also been a victim of terrorism and expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s steadfast support to the government in its fight against terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi stated that security relations between Pakistan and Sri Lanka had remained strong over the years and reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening security cooperation with Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi also met Sri Lankan Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs Sunil Kumara Gamage, with discussions focusing on enhancing cooperation in sports, particularly cricket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides agreed to strengthen collaboration between the respective sports ministries and promote bilateral cooperation in cricket and other sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi stated that cricket and other sports would further strengthen bilateral relations. He also appreciated the excellent arrangements made during the T20 World Cup and thanked the Sri Lankan authorities for their hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He extended an invitation to the Sri Lankan sports minister to visit Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh has invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend Tarique Rahman’s swearing-in as the country’s next leader, a gesture analysts say could help steady relations after months of strain between the neighbours.
Rahman’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secured victory in last week’s national polls, paving the way for the long-time opposition leader to take office after years on the political sidelines.
Modi will not attend Tuesday’s ceremony because of prior commitments, but...</description>

      <title>Watch: Om Birla to attend Bangladesh PM Tarique Rahman’s oath ceremony</title>
      <link>https://www.thehindu.com/videos/watch-om-birla-to-attend-bangladesh-pm-tarique-rahmans-oath-ceremony/article70638291.ece</link>
      <description>India has nominated Om Birla to represent the country at the swearing-in ceremony of Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Tarique Rahman as Prime Minister on February 17 in Dhaka. Prime Minister Narendra Modi declined the invitation due to prior commitments, including engagements with French President Emmanuel Macron. Rahman’s appointment follows the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024. Birla’s participation signals India’s intent to maintain continuity in bilateral ties, even as New Delhi cautiously evaluates its approach toward the new BNP-led government amid recent diplomatic strains.</description>

      <title>Ahsan Iqbal to attend Bangladesh PM-elect Tarique Rahman’s oath-taking ceremony in Dhaka</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal is set to attend the oath-taking ceremony of Bangladesh’s Prime Minister-elect Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who won a landslide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890&quot;&gt;victory&lt;/a&gt; in last week’s elections, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election was the first since a deadly 2024 uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ousted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina. Rahman is a scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement issued today, the FO said that Iqbal will represent Pakistan at the oath-taking ceremony, which is scheduled to be held on February 17 in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/2023286119165825305&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FO added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was unable to attend “due to a prior overseas engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan’s participation in the ceremony reflects its support for Bangladesh’s democratic process and underscores its commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries,” the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman is the son of former Bangladeshi president Ziaur Rahman and the country’s former prime minister &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Khaleda Zia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb 13, BNP won an overwhelming two-thirds majority in the country’s general elections. The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the election results last week, President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz extended their felicitations to the BNP and its leader, Rahman, on securing a landslide majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the sovereignty and democratic aspirations of Bangladesh. While PM Shehbaz said he looked forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership and strengthening the two countries’ “historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ahsan Iqbal to attend Bangladesh’s PM-elect Tarique Rehman’s oath-taking ceremony in Dhaka</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973651/ahsan-iqbal-to-attend-bangladeshs-pm-elect-tarique-rehmans-oath-taking-ceremony-in-dhaka</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal is set to attend the oath-taking ceremony of Bangladesh’s Prime Minister-elect Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who won a landslide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890&quot;&gt;victory&lt;/a&gt; in last week’s elections, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election was the first since a deadly 2024 uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ousted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina. Rahman is a scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement issued today, the FO said that Iqbal will represent Pakistan at the oath-taking ceremony, which is scheduled to be held on February 17 in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/2023286119165825305&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FO added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was unable to attend “due to a prior overseas engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan’s participation in the ceremony reflects its support for Bangladesh’s democratic process and underscores its commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries,” the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman is the son of former Bangladeshi president Ziaur Rahman and the country’s former prime minister &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Khaleda Zia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb 13, BNP won an overwhelming two-thirds majority in the country’s general elections. The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the election results last week, President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz extended their felicitations to the BNP and its leader, Rahman, on securing a landslide majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the sovereignty and democratic aspirations of Bangladesh. While PM Shehbaz said he looked forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership and strengthening the two countries’ “historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s JI-led coalition submits poll complaints</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973578/bangladeshs-ji-led-coalition-submits-poll-complaints</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s Islamist-led coalition, which lost its chance to form the country’s next government in this week’s polls, submitted complaints to the Election Commission on Sunday, challenging results in 32 constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP),&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973288&quot;&gt; led&lt;/a&gt; by Tarique Rahman — the scion of one of the country’s most influential political dynasties — celebrated a sweeping victory in the South Asian nation of 170 million after general elections on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were the first polls since a 2024 uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;ousted &lt;/a&gt;the autocratic government of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alliance identifies 32 constituencies where their candidates were ‘unfairly defeated’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman conceded on Saturday, saying his party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly elected lawmakers are expected to be sworn in on Tuesday, after which Rahman is set to become the country’s next prime minister. But on Sunday, Jamaat officials submitted their complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have identified 32 constituencies where our candidates were unfairly defeated,” said senior Jamaat official Hamidur Rahman Azad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The election day began smoothly, but the ending was not what we had expected. Fake votes, the circulation of black money (bribes), threats, assaults, and attacks marred the atmosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police records show that political clashes during the campaign period left five people dead and more than 600 injured. But despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has so far responded to the results with relative calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least two people were killed in post-poll clashes, while scattered acts of vandalism and assaults were reported in several districts, police said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Jamaat-e-Islami and ally the National Citizen Party (NCP) — formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising — reported attacks on their supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCP loyalists marched through Dhaka University campus against the BNP on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police spokesman AHM Shahadat Hossain said that police were deployed to keep the peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over 150,000 police personnel were trained to tackle pre- and post-election violence,” Hossain said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Election Commission said turnout was 59 per cent across 299 of the 300 constituencies where voting was held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only seven women were directly elected, although a further 50 seats reserved for women will be allocated to parties according to their share of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four members of minority communities won seats, including two Hindus — a population that makes up roughly seven percent in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In the recent elections, Jamaat-e-Islami, known for its pro-Pakistan stance, clinched more than 70 seats in Bangladesh. However, the party will not take the reins of government, instead positioning itself as a formidable opposition voice.</description>

      <description>The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secured a decisive victory in the general elections, winning 49.97% of the votes and 209 seats. Its former ally, Jamaat-e-Islami, emerged as the main opposition with 31.76% of the votes and 68 seats. The election landscape was altered by the disqualification of Sheikh Hasina&apos;s Awami League.</description>

In the last couple of months during the election campaign, a number of national and international media outlets have portrayed Jamaat as a significant force in the upcoming general elections, bolstered by youth support through its student wing, Islami Chattra Shibir, which has gained influence among student leaders, achieved positive results in campus elections, and taken advantage of the political vacuum left by the Awami League. However, the results at the polling station presented a different picture. Was the hype misplaced? Or was it part of a broader narrative that [&amp;#8230;]</description>

      <title>Pakistan to clash with India in T20 World Cup after off-field tumult calms</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973382/pakistan-to-clash-with-india-in-t20-world-cup-after-off-field-tumult-calms</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After weeks of tumult in the cricket arena, the world is finally getting to witness another Pakistan-India blockbuster match today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972941&quot;&gt;sold out&lt;/a&gt; the 35,000-capacity R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both Pakistan and India have won their first two group stage matches, the winners of Sunday’s match will be guaranteed of their berth in the Super Eights round.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--facebook  media__item--relative&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;fb-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was only confirmed as going ahead late on Monday night after the government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;reversed&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421/pakistan-to-participate-in-t20-world-cup-but-will-not-play-against-india-on-feb-15&quot;&gt;decision to boycott&lt;/a&gt; the blockbuster Group A game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reversal followed protracted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;negotiations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between the International Cricket Council (ICC), the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consultations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among national leaders, and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With bilateral cricket a casualty of their fraught relations, emotions run high whenever the bitter neighbours lock horns in multi-team events at neutral venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hugely anticipated match could be hit by bad weather, with rain forecast for Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the game, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi met with the Green Shirts and the team management in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defending champions India have a 7-1 record against Pakistan in the tournament’s history, and they underlined that dominance at last year’s Asia Cup in the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India beat Pakistan three times in that single event, including a stormy final marred by provocative gestures and snubbed handshakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan skipper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973182&quot;&gt;Salman Agha said&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday his team had been “always ready” to face India, despite only being given the green light a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a very big game and the magnitude is huge,” Salman said ahead of the team’s practice at the stadium on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were always ready for the game, whatever be the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had a scrappy last-over three-wicket win in their first match against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971793&quot;&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972421&quot;&gt;beating the USA&lt;/a&gt; by 32 runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are in good momentum and I hope that being in Colombo since the start will help us in terms of conditions,” said Salman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan skipper believed spin would dominate, calling off-spinner Usman Tariq his trump card against India’s powerful batting line-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Usman has been bowling well and I am sure the mystery element will make him our trump card,” Salman said, brushing aside doubts over the legality of Usman’s unique sling-arm action and the exaggerated pause in his delivery stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He has been cleared twice so there are no worries.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>भारत और बांग्लादेश एक-दूसरे को नज़रअंदाज़ नहीं कर सकते: क्यों BNP को भारत के साथ संबंधों को फिर से स्थापित करना चाहिए</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;भारत के प्रति संतुलन बनाने के लिए यदि जानबूझकर Beijing या Islamabad की ओर झुकाव दिखाया जाता है, तो इससे New Delhi चिंतित होगा और पूरे क्षेत्र में ध्रुवीकरण का खतरा बढ़ेगा। Bangladesh की असली ताकत संतुलित कूटनीति में है—आर्थिक रूप से China से जुड़ाव, Pakistan के साथ संबंध बनाए रखना, लेकिन अपने तत्काल पड़ोस की नीति को India के साथ स्थिरता पर आधारित रखना।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan set to clash with India in T20 World Cup after off-field tumult calms</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973382/pakistan-set-to-clash-with-india-in-t20-world-cup-after-off-field-tumult-calms</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;After weeks of tumult in the cricket arena, the world is finally getting to witness another Pakistan-India blockbuster match today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972941&quot;&gt;sold out&lt;/a&gt; the 35,000-capacity R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both Pakistan and India have won their first two group stage matches, the winners of Sunday’s match will be guaranteed of their berth in the Super Eights round.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--facebook  media__item--relative&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;fb-video&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was only confirmed as going ahead late on Monday night after the government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;reversed&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421/pakistan-to-participate-in-t20-world-cup-but-will-not-play-against-india-on-feb-15&quot;&gt;decision to boycott&lt;/a&gt; the blockbuster Group A game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reversal followed protracted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;negotiations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between the International Cricket Council (ICC), the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consultations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among national leaders, and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With bilateral cricket a casualty of their fraught relations, emotions run high whenever the bitter neighbours lock horns in multi-team events at neutral venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hugely anticipated match could be hit by bad weather, with rain forecast for Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the game, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) Chairman Mohsin Naqvi met with the Green Shirts and the team management in Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defending champions India have a 7-1 record against Pakistan in the tournament’s history, and they underlined that dominance at last year’s Asia Cup in the UAE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India beat Pakistan three times in that single event, including a stormy final marred by provocative gestures and snubbed handshakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan skipper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973182&quot;&gt;Salman Agha said&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday his team had been “always ready” to face India, despite only being given the green light a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a very big game and the magnitude is huge,” Salman said ahead of the team’s practice at the stadium on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were always ready for the game, whatever be the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had a scrappy last-over three-wicket win in their first match against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971793&quot;&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972421&quot;&gt;beating the USA&lt;/a&gt; by 32 runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are in good momentum and I hope that being in Colombo since the start will help us in terms of conditions,” said Salman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan skipper believed spin would dominate, calling off-spinner Usman Tariq his trump card against India’s powerful batting line-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Usman has been bowling well and I am sure the mystery element will make him our trump card,” Salman said, brushing aside doubts over the legality of Usman’s unique sling-arm action and the exaggerated pause in his delivery stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He has been cleared twice so there are no worries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman hoped the players would shake hands, unlike during the Asia Cup matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The game should be played in the true spirit of the game,” he said. “It has been the norm in cricket for years but whatever way they want, we will only know tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973199/t20-world-cup-suryakumar-says-india-vs-pakistan-not-just-another-game&quot;&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday that no matter how much his team tried to prepare for today’s clash against Pakistan as “just another game”, it would be much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big platform, obviously,” Suryakumar told reporters in Colombo. “No matter how much you say that it’s just another game, it is a big game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper added, “We don’t play them often, don’t even play them regularly. But at the end of the day, we try to keep things simple and try to execute our best game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is pressure, but there is a big opportunity,” he continued. “According to me, when you play an India-Pakistan game, it’s more about the occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suryakumar said opener Abhishek Sharma has recovered well from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972519&quot;&gt;stomach bug&lt;/a&gt; and was likely to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian captain played down the hype around Usman’s bowling action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have practised with similar types of bowlers and similar actions so we will try to execute what we are practising in the night sessions,” said Suryakumar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper would not say whether his players would shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts in Colombo today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will break the suspense tomorrow,” he said. “Wait for 24 hours, let us play the game which is more important.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>India and Bangladesh Cannot Wish Away Each Other: Why BNP Must Reset Relations with India</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A deliberate drift toward Beijing or Islamabad as counterweights to India would alarm New Delhi and risk regional polarization. Bangladesh’s strength lies in balanced diplomacy—engaging China economically, maintaining relations with Pakistan, but grounding its immediate neighborhood policy in stability with India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh’s new BNP-led government has formally congratulated Narendra Modi and may invite him to its swearing-in, signalling a possible reset in India–Bangladesh ties. With Dhaka stressing “national interest” on issues like the Ganga Water Treaty, New Delhi’s response could shape future cooperation on water-sharing, trade, borders, and regional stability.</description>

      <title>Jackson Heights in New York buzzes with hope as Bangladesh embraces democracy</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973331/jackson-heights-in-new-york-buzzes-with-hope-as-bangladesh-embraces-democracy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: In New York, the Jackson Heights neighbourhood is alive with smells and sounds that evoke home: hilsa frying in mustard oil, &lt;em&gt;khajur gurr&lt;/em&gt; stacked beside jars of &lt;em&gt;achar&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sari&lt;/em&gt; shops glittering with Tangail cottons and Jamdani silks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chatter of Bangla in every accent — from the clipped tones of Shudhu Bangla to the soft drawl of Noakhali and the rolling lilt of Chittagong — further authenticated the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurants serving Bengali biryani and pakoras sit side by side with Pakistani eateries. Mosques are filled with worshippers preparing for Ramazan, with banners welcoming the holy month and offers of free iftar visible on doors and gates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vibrant diaspora community, the largest Bangladeshi settlement in North America, marked the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973288/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-thanks-those-who-fought-for-democracy&quot;&gt; elections&lt;/a&gt; and welcomed the results with a festive yet reflective mood. Residents had long participated in protests outside the United Nations headquarters against Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s government. The neighbourhood has Awami League supporters too, but most are silent for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are hoping that it will bring stability and prosperity to Bangladesh,” said Abul Hassan, a longtime shopkeeper. “We Bangladeshis have proven time and again that we do not tolerate tyranny. Hasina Wajed failed because she became a tyrant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hassan said most in Jackson Heights support the BNP, though some also admire Jamaat-e-Islami. Rasheed Ahmed, who runs a clothing store, called Jamaat’s success “a historic achievement for them anywhere in South Asia,” expressing hope it could play a constructive role in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#the-rise-of-political-islam&quot; id=&quot;the-rise-of-political-islam&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The rise of political Islam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s victory was widely expected in Jackson Heights too, even before the Awami League was barred from the contest, leaving Bangladesh’s largest opposition party with a clear path. Jamaat-e-Islami’s gain of around 70 seats, however, has stunned analysts and raised concerns about the rise of political Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taj Hashmi, a Toronto-based historian and Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, stressed the structural factors behind these results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP’s win was predictable,” he said. “Eighteen years of political exclusion cannot erase deep-rooted grassroots networks. Anti-incumbency sentiment was enough to secure their return.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While a formidable party like the Awami League was absent from the poll (for the right or wrong reasons), it was obvious that it would benefit the largest political party, the BNP,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s surprising is that the Jamaat-e-Islami, who never ever polled more than 4 to 7 per cent of the vote in Bangladesh since 1979, has captured around 70 seats in the parliament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jamaat’s gains, he added: “The Jamaat’s rise reflects not only protest votes but the growing influence of political Islam among marginalised communities. Socioeconomic deprivation, unemployment, and decades of perceived injustice created fertile ground for their ideology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hashmi highlighted the party’s historical persecution: “Under Hasina, Jamaat leaders were executed or imprisoned on charges dating back to 1971. That repression, while intended to weaken them, instead fortified their narrative as a party of martyrs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was candid about the party’s ideology: “Jamaat’s intellectual roots lie in a vision of an Islamic state that is anti-individualist, and opposed to gender equality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding nuance, he noted: “Political Islam has been rising gradually, but it was exacerbated by Hasina’s heavy-handed rule. People seek alternatives, and even if Jamaat’s agenda is concerning, their parliamentary presence now is a reflection of deeper societal currents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Mohammad Imran Hossain, a visiting professor from Dhaka in New York, framed the elections in terms of regional diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In recent years, Bangladesh–Pakistan relations have been formal but cautious,” the executive director of Bangladesh Institute of Development and Security Studies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A BNP-led government could normalise ties incrementally, focusing on trade, flights, and pragmatic engagement — while still balancing the vital relationship with India.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Imran cautioned that changes would be measured: “Dramatic breakthroughs are unlikely. Progress depends on mutual respect and the ability to manage the legacy of 1971. If both sides see strategic value, relations could improve steadily within broader regional frameworks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imran also highlighted the domestic dimension: “The rise of Jamaat, while politically significant, could challenge governance. BNP will need to ensure democratic norms while integrating these actors responsibly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: “The BNP’s foreign policy orientation will likely be pro-China and cautious toward India. That may unsettle New Delhi but could provide space for Bangladesh to diversify partnerships.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observations from Washington&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s congratulatory message sounded cautious and formal. “Congratulations to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its leader Tarique Rahman as well as the people of Bangladesh. The United States looks forward to working with the newly elected government to advance prosperity and the security of the region,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN emphasised inclusive participation while noting intimidation and harassment of women candidates, including in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based scholar of South Asian affairs, described the process as peaceful, with strong turnout and no parties threatening to reject the results — a “significant step for democratisation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arch-rivals will clash in the T20 World Cup Group ‘A’ match in Colombo on Sunday, still feeling the aftershocks of a tumultuous fortnight in which Pakistan’s boycott call, which was later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;reversed&lt;/a&gt;, nearly blew a hole in the tournament’s marquee fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With bilateral cricket a casualty of their fraught relations, emotions run high whenever the bitter neighbours lock horns in multi-team events at neutral venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s strained relations with another neighbour, Bangladesh, have further tangled the geopolitics around the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced by Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in the 20-team field for refusing to tour India over safety concerns, the regional chessboard shifted. The Pakistan government, in solidarity with Bangladesh, decided to boycott the match against India, a move that could jeopardise a highly lucrative fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan reversed its decision of the Feb 15 game boycott on Monday night only after hectic negotiations involving top officials of the Pakistan Cricket Board, International Cricket Council and the Bangladesh Cricket Board in Lahore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly on cricketing merit, however, the rivalry has remained one-sided in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defending champions India have a 7-1 record against Pakistan in the tournament’s history and they underlined that dominance at last year’s Asia Cup in the UAE. India beat Pakistan three times in that single event, including a stormy final marred by provocative gestures and snubbed handshakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘ALWAYS READY FOR INDIA’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan skipper Salman Agha said on Saturday his team had been “always ready” to face India on Sunday at the T20 World Cup, despite only being given the green light a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket has sold out the 35,000-capacity R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a very big game and the magnitude is huge,” Salman said ahead of the team’s practice at the stadium on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were always ready for the game, whatever be the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had a scrappy last-over three-wicket win in their first match against the Netherlands before beating the USA by 32 runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are in good momentum and I hope that being in Colombo since the start will help us in terms of conditions,” said Salman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hugely anticipated match could be hit by bad weather, with rain forecast for Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan skipper believed spin would dominate, calling off-spinner Usman Tariq his trump card against India’s powerful batting line-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Usman has been bowling well and I am sure the mystery element will make him our trump card,” Salman said, brushing aside doubts over the legality of Usman’s unique sling-arm action and the exaggerated pause in his delivery stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He has been cleared twice so there are no worries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman hoped the players would shake hands, unlike during the Asia Cup matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The game should be played in the true spirit of the game,” he said. “It has been the norm in cricket for years but whatever way they want, we will only know tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both Pakistan and India have won their first two group stage matches, the winners of Sunday’s match will be guaranteed of their berth in the Super Eights round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOT JUST ANOTHER GAME: SURYAKUMAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973199&quot;&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday that no matter how much his team tried to prepare for Sunday’s T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan as “just another game”, it would be much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big platform, obviously,” Suryakumar told reporters in Colombo. “No matter how much you say that it’s just another game, it is a big game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper added, “We don’t play them often, don’t even play them regularly. But at the end of the day, we try to keep things simple and try to execute our best game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is pressure, but there is a big opportunity,” he continued. “According to me, when you play an India-Pakistan game, it’s more about the occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suryakumar said opener Abhishek Sharma has recovered well from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972519&quot;&gt;stomach bug&lt;/a&gt; and was likely to play. The big-hitting 25-year-old, who skipped the Namibia match due to the health problem, batted in the nets on Saturday, which indicates the left-hander is in the frame for the high-octane Sunday clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian captain played down the hype around Usman’s bowling action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have practised with similar types of bowlers and similar actions so we will try to execute what we are practising in the night sessions,” said Suryakumar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper would not say whether his players would shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts in Colombo today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will break the suspense tomorrow,” he said. “Wait for 24 hours, let us play the game which is more important.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh’s Tarique Rahman thanks those who fought for democracy</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973288/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-thanks-those-who-fought-for-democracy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Bangladesh’s PM-to-be pledges to restore governance, economy; vows to fix ‘broken’ systems&lt;br /&gt;• Urges unity as BNP sweeps first polls since 2024 uprising&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s prime minister-in-waiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday dedicated his party’s landslide election &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890/bangladeshs-bnp-wins-big-in-historic-parliamentary-election&quot;&gt;victory &lt;/a&gt;to the citizens who “sacrificed for democracy” during the deadly 2024 uprising and pledged to prioritise the restoration of economy and governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, the 60-year-old scion of one of the nation’s most powerful political dynasties, called for national unity as he prepared to lead the South Asian nation of 170 million people following the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s sweeping success in Thursday’s vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will take over from an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has steered Bangladesh since a student-led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1867302&quot;&gt;uprising &lt;/a&gt;ousted Hasina in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy,” Rahman said in his first speech since the vote. “This victory belongs to people who aspire to and have sacrificed for democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Election Commission reported the BNP alliance won 212 seats, securing a decisive two-thirds majority compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance. Turnout was reported at 59 per cent across 299 constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The win marks a remarkable turnaround for Rahman, who returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years of exile in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he emphasised that the new government faces “daunting challenges”, putting the restoration of governance and the stabilisation of the financial sector at the top of his agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by an authoritarian regime, weakening constitutional and structural institutions, and destroying law and order,” Rahman said. “We have very serious challenges to face … tackle the economy of the country … to ensure good governance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters on Thursday also endorsed a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus through a concurrent referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approved reforms include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence intended to prevent a return to one-party rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from participating in the polls. Speaking from hiding in India, the 78-year-old former leader — sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity — issued a statement decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, whose party quadrupled its seats in parliament, conceded on Saturday despite initially alleging “inconsistencies”. He pledged to serve as a “vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman urged political rivals to work together following the tumultuous transition. “Our paths and opinions may differ, but in the interest of the country, we must remain united,” Rahman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman is the son of former President Ziaur Rahman and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt; died &lt;/a&gt;last year. While rivals have criticised his political career for alleged corruption, charges he has denied, his party’s commanding majority is viewed by analysts as a crucial opportunity to restore political stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The freedom-loving, pro-democracy people of the country have once again brought victory to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party,” Rahman said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COMMENT: Oxygen of world cricket is back</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973299/comment-oxygen-of-world-cricket-is-back</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/6990f5b8366fd.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE cricket world held its breath for one week when Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970749&quot;&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; to boycott its T20 World Cup group stage fixture against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with back-channel talks having broken the deadlock between the stakeholders, on Sunday evening at the R. Pre­madasa Stadium, it will exhale in one collective roar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan versus India in a T20 World Cup is not merely a match; it is the fixture that keeps the sport’s heartbeat strong. Whatever the result, the game will remind millions why they fell in love with cricket in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue itself is part of the narrative. The Premadasa Stadium has hosted many thrillers, but rarely one carrying this much baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan to face India today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A used pitch — likely the same surface on which Zimbabwe&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972974/zimbabwe-upset-australia-arsenal-drop-points-ratcliffe-under-review-dawn-news-english&quot;&gt; humbled &lt;/a&gt;Australia on Friday — awaits the two teams. It is slow, grippy and low. In such conditions the ball holds in the surface, turns a fraction and rewards the bowler who can vary pace and trajectory. Spin, not raw pace, will decide the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides have recognised the shift. India will lean on Varun Chakravarthy’s mystery, Axar Patel’s left-arm control and may also throw in Kuldeep Yadav’s wrist-spin — which has worried Pakistan over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will counter with a carousel of their own: Shadab Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz and, most intriguingly, the 30-year-old off-spinner Usman Tariq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usman’s action has been the talk of the tournament. The brief pause at the crease, the low-arm sling, the ball that skids or dips — it has left batters guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has already been reported twice and cleared twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha calls him the “trump card”. In the spin-friendly Colombo air, that card could be decisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Usman lands his variations on the money, even India’s middle order — Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Rinku Singh — may find the boundaries suddenly distant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Pakistan cannot rely on spin alone. The fast-bowling equation presents its own conundrum. Shaheen Shah Afridi remains the marquee name, the leader of the attack, the man who has delivered in big games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the left-arm seamer Salman Mirza has been impressive in the lead-up, generating swing and hitting the deck hard. Conditions on Sunday may not offer extravagant movement, yet the temptation to play both, or to prefer Mirza’s current rhythm over Shaheen’s experience, is real. The management must decide whether sentiment or data guides the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s batting, meanwhile, carries familiar vulnerabilities. The top order has fired in the first two matches, with Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub providing brisk starts. But Salman Agha and former skipper Babar Azam have to make better contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against India’s varied batting line-up, especially if Abhishek Sharma is fit, any collapse could prove fatal. Abhishek, the explosive left-hander, missed India’s game again Namibia with a stomach infection. He has since been cleared and insists he is fit. If he walks out at the top, the powerplay could belong to India in a hurry. Weather adds another layer of uncertainty. Colombo has been humid, and forecasts speak of a low-pressure system lingering over the Bay of Bengal. Morning and afternoon showers are possible; the evening is expected to be overcast but largely dry, with temperatures hovering around 27-28°C and humidity in the low-to-mid 70s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political factor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off the field, the political backdrop is impossible to ignore. Only days ago Pakistan had threatened to boycott the contest in solidarity with Bangladesh after the latter’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;exclusion&lt;/a&gt; from the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intensive negotiations in Lahore involving the International Cricket Council (ICC), the Pakistan Cricket Board and its Bangladesh counterpart produced a last-minute reversal as the ICC gave in to a few demands put forward by the PCB and the BCB. Now, fresh reports suggest that representatives of the BCB, PCB, the Afghanistan Cricket Board and the Board of Control for Cricket in India may hold informal meetings on the sidelines of Sunday’s game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether those conversations yield concrete results on bilateral cricket or future tournaments. But the very fact they are happening in Colombo underlines how deeply intertwined sport and diplomacy have become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, the challenge is clear. They enter as slight underdogs India have won 13 of the last 16 T20I meetings yet the conditions are more even than at any recent clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premadasa Stadium is unlikely to be a 200-run ground on Sunday; 160-170 may be a fighting total. Discipline with the bat, control with the ball and, above all, composure under the weight of expectation will separate the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Shirts have the tools. Usman’s variations, the left-arm pace dilemma, a settled top order and the knowledge that they have already beaten strong sides in this tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But India remain the benchmark — clinical, deep and ruthless when the big moments arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come Sunday evening, 35,000 spectators will pack the Premadasa, millions more will tune in across the Subcontinent and beyond, and the world will remember why this fixture still matters. Win, lose or tie, cricket will be the richer for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oxygen is back. Let the match begin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CRICKET: REBALANCING CRICKET</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973281/cricket-rebalancing-cricket</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was never going to be easy for the International Cricket Council (ICC) to sideline Pakistan from the T20 World Cup, let alone exclude them from the marquee clash against India. That is precisely why, today on February 15, Pakistan will take on India for the ninth time in T20 World Cup history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a rivalry in which Pakistan has managed only one victory so far. Yet win numbers barely matter when these two teams meet, because this contest has grown far beyond cricket and has become arguably the most anticipated fixture in global sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the build-up to this match, uncertainty loomed large. Until just days before the game, there was no official confirmation that Pakistan would play. This followed a dramatic political intervention when the Government of Pakistan announced that it would not permit the Pakistan team to participate in the World Cup group-stage match against India. Despite the tournament featuring 20 teams, this single lucrative fixture dominated headlines across the cricketing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tension had been sparked when Bangladesh approached the ICC, requesting that their World Cup matches be shifted out of India due to political and security concerns. The ICC rejected this request, citing operational challenges, and eventually removed Bangladesh from the tournament, replacing them with Scotland. This decision sent shockwaves through the cricket community and raised serious questions about fairness and consistency in governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The most anticipated match in the ongoing T20 World Cup, Pakistan versus India today, almost didn’t happen. But the issue was always about more than a single match. It was about respect, equity and the balance of power in international cricket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Pakistan emerged as the only major cricketing nation willing to stand publicly in solidarity with Bangladesh. Pakistan’s position was rooted in recent precedent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2025 Champions Trophy, India refused to travel to Pakistan and the ICC allowed their matches to be played at a neutral venue in the UAE. Similarly, in the 2026 T20 World Cup, Pakistan was already playing all its matches in Sri Lanka rather than India. Given this background, many believed that Bangladesh deserved the same consideration rather than outright exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan government took a firm stance and instructed the national team not to play India unless the issue was addressed. This moment marked a rare instance of a powerful cricket board openly challenging both the ICC and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sky Sports, former England captain and respected commentator Nasser Hussain weighed in on the controversy. He remarked that it was difficult to imagine the ICC treating India the same way if they had refused to play in a host country at short notice. He further stated that Pakistan was speaking to the ICC and BCCI in the only language that truly moves world cricket, financial leverage and commercial reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hussain also expressed admiration for both Bangladesh and Pakistan, praising Bangladesh for taking a principled stand and Pakistan for defending another full member of the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation reached a turning point on Sunday, February 8, when the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president and the ICC deputy chairman travelled to Pakistan for high-level talks with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi. These discussions proved crucial and, by Monday evening, a resolution began to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting, the BCB formally requested Pakistan to proceed with the match against India on February 15. Shortly after, the ICC issued a detailed press release outlining key assurances, including recognition of Bangladesh as a valued full member with a proud cricketing heritage, confirmation that their absence from the 2026 World Cup would not harm their long-term cricketing future and a commitment to continue supporting cricket development in Bangladesh, a nation of over 200 million passionate fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the ICC confirmed that no financial, sporting or administrative penalties would be imposed on Bangladesh. The BCB also retained the right to approach the ICC Dispute Resolution Committee if it chose to do so. Additionally, Bangladesh was guaranteed hosting rights for an ICC event between 2028 and 2031, ahead of the 2031 Men’s Cricket World Cup, subject to standard procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this resolution, the Government of Pakistan officially announced on social media platform X that Pakistan would indeed play India today. This marked a historic moment in cricket diplomacy, where one board stood up for another in the name of fairness and equality among ICC members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this positive outcome, a misleading narrative began circulating in the Indian media. Several outlets portrayed Pakistan as backing down or surrendering under pressure. This interpretation was far from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that India versus Pakistan matches in ICC tournaments generate immense global viewership and revenue. Broadcasters, sponsors, the ICC, BCCI and PCB all benefit significantly from this rivalry. Even during periods of intense public hostility, such as the 2025 Asia Cup, India ultimately played Pakistan despite political tensions at home. At that time, Indian players refused to shake hands as a symbolic gesture, yet they still participated because a full boycott was simply not commercially viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made this situation different was that Pakistan became the first team to openly risk financial losses and potential ICC sanctions by threatening to withdraw from the biggest match in world cricket. This was not a retreat but a calculated stand based on principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the ICC was never in a position to simply remove or punish Pakistan the way it did with Bangladesh, even though this was exactly what many in India, particularly sections of Indian media and officials close to the BCCI, were hoping for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kicking Pakistan out of a global event was never going to be straightforward, because Pakistan is one half of the biggest rivalry in world cricket, a rivalry that generates enormous revenue, viewership, sponsorship and broadcast value for every ICC tournament. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The India versus Pakistan contest is not just another match, it is one of the most commercially powerful fixtures in international sport and the entire financial model of ICC events benefits heavily from its existence. Broadcasters pay premium rights fees largely because of this match-up. Sponsors invest more when these two teams meet. And host countries rely on this game to maximise ticket sales and global engagement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, the ICC had to handle Pakistan’s stance with far greater caution and diplomacy than it did with Bangladesh, as any harsh action against Pakistan would have directly damaged the tournament’s commercial appeal and credibility. Unlike Bangladesh, Pakistan sits at the centre of the most profitable rivalry in cricket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, all three parties, Pakistan, India and the ICC, ultimately wanted this match to go ahead. However, Pakistan ensured that the ICC and BCCI acknowledged the need for fair treatment of all member nations rather than selective enforcement based on power or politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, this episode became a win-win situation. Bangladesh secured a future ICC hosting opportunity without any penalties, while Pakistan demonstrated leadership, solidarity and moral courage. More importantly, Pakistan proved that it is not merely a participant in world cricket but a nation willing to challenge the system when fairness is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not just about a single match. It was about respect, equity and the balance of power in international cricket. And on that front, Pakistan emerged with its reputation not only intact but strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Population surge threatens growth, warns Aurangzeb</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973310/population-surge-threatens-growth-warns-aurangzeb</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Insists govt can’t create jobs for millions of people; private sector must lead employment drive&lt;br /&gt;
• Claims FIR registered against sitting senator over alleged tax evasion&lt;br /&gt;
• Says tobacco sector ‘not paying taxes’, involved in smuggling&lt;br /&gt;
• Construction relief package ‘in pipeline’, announcement expected soon&lt;br /&gt;
• Textile support under review; minister seeks 10-12 days for concrete steps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb on Saturday warned that Pakistan could not be run with a rapidly increasing population and stressed that the private sector would have to take the lead and create employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If this growth rate (2.5pc) continues, our population can reach 400 million in the coming years. So, you tell us who will run this country in such a situation,” he said while speaking at the Pakistan Economic Growth Conference at the regional office of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) in Lahore. “So please help us on how to control the population,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On employment, the minister said the government alone could not provide jobs to the entire population of 250 million. “The private sector should lead the country’s economy and provide jobs,” he said, adding that the government’s role was to strengthen and enable the private sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister emphasised the need to adopt the strategy that Bangladesh had used to control its population. “When you talk about Bangladesh with reference to taxation, competitiveness, growth, etc, while comparing with Pakistan, why don’t you talk about its journey to control population,” he questioned, requesting the businesspersons to come forward and help the government reduce the population growth.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Aurangzeb said the government was making efforts to broaden the tax base, claiming that an FIR had been registered against a sitting senator over alleged tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tobacco and cigarette companies, except for two, are not paying taxes. They are also involved in smuggling. But we are not sparing them. We got an FIR even against a sitting senator,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the government had started monitoring sales tax on goods starting with the sugar industry and would move to other sectors in phases. “The PM has instructed us to start this from the sugar industry since his family is engaged in this [sugar] business,” Mr Aurangzeb claimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finance minister said that after economic stabilisation, industrialisation was essential for sustainable growth and reiterated that the government was pursuing an export-led policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said relief measures for the construction sector were in the pipeline and would soon be announced by the prime minister, while support for the textile sector and possible reductions in taxes linked to the property sector were also under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said digitisation would improve transparency and revenue collection and acknowledged that the salaried class bore a disproportionate share of the tax burden. He reiterated the government’s commitment to providing relief to salaried individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting developments in the construction sector, the finance minister said the work was actively underway and efforts were being made to broaden the tax net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He clarified that the real estate and construction sectors were being treated separately, adding that construction was linked with multiple allied industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He assured the business community that their issues would be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the textile sector, he said that its issues were currently under review and requested 10 to 12 more days, assuring that concrete steps would be announced shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further stated that the government was reviewing the possibility of reducing multiple taxes in the property sector while carefully balancing fiscal responsibilities with sectoral demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Aurangzeb said that the positive impact of Pakistan’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has begun to materialise, restoring the confidence of international financial institutions in Pakistan’s economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the country was now firmly on the path of stability and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that difficult but necessary decisions were taken to ensure fiscal discipline, particularly when Pakistan faced the risk of default. While the 2022 floods severely affected the economy, he said the country had sufficient capacity to absorb the losses caused by the 2025 floods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finance minister described IT exports as the future of Pakistan’s economy, stating that current IT exports stood at $3-4 billion, with the potential to reach $8-10bn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stressed that export proceeds must be fully repatriated, as a significant portion — around $4-5bn — was currently retained abroad. He further stated that foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan were increasing consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Due to prudent government policies, inflation has declined to record lows, providing tangible relief to the general public,” he said, reiterating that the salaried class would continue to receive priority relief measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, former minister Gohar Ejaz expressed concern over heavy taxation on real estate and other sectors, saying it was pushing investment abroad, particularly to Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pakistani people have already purchased properties worth $100bn in Dubai. A property expo for investment in Dubai is also being held in Lahore. And this city, after Karachi and other major cities, will be empty soon,” he deplored, requesting the government to reduce taxes on real estate and other sectors for economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The BNP resumes office for the first time since 2006, now under the next generation of the Ziaur Rahman family. For Tareque Rahman, London-based and long in the political wilderness, the weight of history may weigh more heavily than the promise of the future. Even accounting for the glaring defect of the Awami League&apos;s exclusion, the outcome is preferable to the dysfunction and mischief of recent months.</description>

      <description>Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb announced he will travel to the United States next week to advance economic engagement. The visit comes as Pakistan reassesses trade strategy following agreements between Washington, New Delhi, and Bangladesh. The move is critical for Pakistan’s export-driven sectors, especially textiles, which dominate US-bound shipments.

&lt;p&gt;Held on 12 February 2026, the poll followed the 2024 student-led uprising that forced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg3ee303yxpo&quot;&gt;Sheikh Hasina from office&lt;/a&gt; and ushered in an interim administration under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Bangladesh Election Commission, BNP and its allies won 212 of the 300 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad (national parliament), securing a two-thirds majority, far surpassing the 151 required to form government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) and its allies secured 77 seats, including six won by the National Citizen Party (NCP), a formation led by figures from the student uprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNP chairman Tarique Rahman is now poised to become prime minister after more than 17 years in exile, completing one of the most dramatic political comebacks in recent Bangladeshi history.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrested in 2007, later exiled to the United Kingdom, and long shadowed by corruption allegations he denies, Rahman returned to Bangladesh in December 2025 to contest his first parliamentary election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his first address to the nation after the victory, he said: “This victory belongs to Bangladesh. It belongs to democracy. It belongs to the people who have aspired to and sacrificed for democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former leader Hasina’s Awami League (AL) was officially barred from contesting the election following the uprising that ousted her after &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1160046&quot;&gt;security forces killed at least 1,400 protesters.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upheaval triggered a transitional legal process targeting senior figures in her government. In May 2025, the interim administration suspended the party’s registration pending investigations into allegations of electoral manipulation, abuse of state power and human rights violations during its final years in office, effectively preventing the AL from fielding candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exiled in India, Hasina dismissed the election as a “deception and a farce”, arguing that a vote conducted without her party’s participation could not be considered fully democratic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Reclaiming the right to choose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than a decade in which elections were widely criticised as coercive or predetermined, stepping into a polling booth carried emotional weight for many Bangladeshis. The 2024 uprising had broken open a political order, but it had also ushered in a fragile transitional period in which law and order felt unsettled and the future unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;A large parliamentary majority creates an opportunity for reform, but also the temptation to centralise power and sideline dissent&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Anu Muhammad, political economist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across districts, voters described a mix of relief and cautious hope. “For years we stood in line and felt nothing would change,” Mohammad Salam, a 38-year-old shopkeeper in Bogura told Middle East Eye. “Today, at least, I felt my vote would be counted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Dhaka, Mehruba Akhter, a first-time voter, linked the ballot directly to the people’s uprising. “We were on the streets demanding change,” she said. “Now we are trying to shape that change.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writer and researcher Altaf Parvez told MEE that lower- and middle-income citizens participated in large numbers in both the July uprising and elections. “Their participation carried a single message: a desire for change,” he said. “Eighteen months ago, they demanded change with blood. This time, they repeated that demand through ballots.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parvez described the election as a direct outcome of the uprising and argued that the new parliament must “repay the debt to the martyrs” by undertaking substantive steps, from police reform and economic restructuring to rehabilitating public administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political economist Anu Muhammad echoed that sense of historic responsibility but cautioned against complacency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A large parliamentary majority creates an opportunity for reform, but also the temptation to centralise power and sideline dissent,” he told MEE, recalling similar landslide victories in 2001 and 2008 that later eroded democratic norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A rightward shift&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the election restored competitive politics, it also revealed how far the centre of gravity has shifted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh’s chapter of the most prevalent Islamist political party in the Indian subcontinent, emerged from the vote as the second-largest bloc in parliament. Its 77 seats, secured with its allies, were its strongest parliamentary showing in the country’s history.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once marginalised and, at times, formally restricted from political participation, JI re-entered the electoral arena after the 2024 rupture with organisational discipline, financial resources and a sharpened ideological message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that the transition period created space for religious and right-wing actors to assert themselves more visibly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parvez says that JI reorganised itself “with remarkable efficiency,” transforming from what had been a fourth-tier electoral force into a credible competitor to major parties in multiple constituencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its campaign leaned heavily on themes of moral order, anti-corruption and administrative discipline, messaging that resonated in a period marked by economic stress and institutional distrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, JI&apos;s rise has intensified scrutiny of its position on women and public life. JI’s leader has stated unequivocally in past speeches that women should not occupy the highest executive offices of the state.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a controversial post on X, he also likened women working outside the home to “prostitution”, a remark that drew a sharp backlash before he later claimed his account had been hacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[Jamaat] will not be able to confine women to their homes again, and must offer a public apology with folded hands,” leftist student activist Sayera Chandra Chakma told MEE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many women, particularly younger and urban voters who mobilised during the 2024 uprising, JI&apos;s expanded parliamentary presence signals a renewed contest over whether women’s equality in Bangladesh is negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samina Lutfa, professor of sociology at the University of Dhaka, argued that tactical alliances between segments of the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) and JI may have alienated parts of the urban, younger women’s constituency that had mobilised during the 2024 uprising with hopes of a broader, more inclusive civic space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She described the shift as a return to “old-style power politics”, warning that the pursuit of parliamentary advantage risked diluting the moral force of July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her view, sections of the post-uprising leadership failed to take a principled stand against episodes of mob mobilisation during periods of instability, only later repositioning themselves as inheritors of the movement’s legacy. “Claiming the uprising’s symbolism without shouldering its responsibility,” she suggested, “has weakened public trust.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, the election has institutionalised a rightward current that had been gathering momentum since the uprising. Competitive democracy has returned, but so has sharper ideological contestation, particularly over the meaning of pluralism, secularism and gender equality in Bangladesh’s political future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Women’s representation: participation without power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While women voted in large numbers, their representation in parliament remains starkly low. Of 300 directly elected seats, only seven women won - just over 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;We did not beg. We asked for what is rightfully ours&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Seuty Sabur, Brac University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imbalance began at nomination, long before ballots were cast. According to election data, 30 of the 51 political parties, including JI, did not nominate a single woman candidate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The July Charter, which emerged from a very male-dominated post-uprising consensus process, sets only a 5 percent threshold for women’s representation in candidate nominations, a target that activists argue falls far short of both the 30 percent requirement under existing electoral law and long-standing demands for one-third representation in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Women have been underrepresented, and political parties have miserably failed to ensure women’s representation,” Seuty Sabur, associate professor of anthropology at Brac University, told MEE. “Many of us were angry and exhausted from reminding parties of their duties. Women were left alone to fend for themselves in claiming equal citizen rights.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She noted that women’s groups had demanded 33 percent representation, proportional inclusion in consecutive terms and direct elections for reserved seats. “We did not beg,” she said. “We asked for what is rightfully ours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Sabur, the election brings mixed emotions. “The only sigh of relief is that the election happened and anti-liberation forces [those who resisted the liberation war of Bangladesh in 1971] are not the majority. For now, we can breathe a little while continuing to build inclusive spaces.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mandate and path to reform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the parliamentary election, voters were asked whether they supported a package of constitutional reforms proposed in the aftermath of the July 2024 uprising.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the election commission, 48 million voters chose “yes” and 22.5 million voted “no”, out of nearly 77 million ballots cast, a turnout of just over 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the proposal passed comfortably nationwide, the “no” vote prevailed in 11 constituencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before polling day, some civil society groups had criticised the design of the referendum itself. Lawyers, academics and rights advocates noted that 84 reform proposals were bundled into a single yes or no question, limiting granular debate and informed choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some constituencies, voters said they remained uncertain about the full scope of what a “yes” or “no” vote would mean in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the scale of the “yes” vote provides the incoming parliament with a reform mandate that is politically difficult to dismiss. Unlike referendums held under military rule in 1977 and 1985, which produced near-unanimous approval, or the low-turnout constitutional vote of 1991, this referendum took place alongside a competitive national election and yielded a more differentiated outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Although the outcome does not settle every constitutional debate, it signals public endorsement of structural change,” said Parvez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next phase will determine how that mandate is interpreted. Constitutional reform is expected to move through parliamentary committees, potentially including a dedicated constitutional reform council as envisaged in post-uprising discussions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key areas under consideration include rebalancing executive power, strengthening parliamentary oversight, reforming policing and public administration and revisiting provisions related to decentralisation and judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How inclusive that process becomes, particularly whether minority representatives, indigenous leaders, women’s groups and opposition parties are substantively involved, will shape its legitimacy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A supermajority gives BNP the numerical capacity to amend the constitution, but the durability of reform will depend on the consultation process. If pursued unilaterally, it risks reopening the cycle of constitutional centralisation that has defined much of Bangladesh’s recent political history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, Bangladesh has completed a largely peaceful and broadly accepted electoral contest. But the deeper verdict lies ahead. With a decisive majority in hand, BNP faces a familiar test: whether it will use its mandate to institutionalise accountability and pluralism, or repeat cycles of centralisation and backlash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electorate has signalled its desire for change, first through protest, now through ballots. As one elderly voter put it quietly outside a polling centre: “We have done our part. Now they must do theirs.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Election Commission figures showed Rahman’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had won a landslide victory in the elections on Thursday, the first since a deadly 2024 uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ousted&lt;/a&gt; the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of BNP chief Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, the scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties, is expected to make a victory speech later on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His father, president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;Khaleda Zia&lt;/a&gt;, served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;led&lt;/a&gt; the country of 170 million as interim leader since the uprising, said Rahman “would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP alliance won 212 seats compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had said on Friday he would “seek redress” from the commission, with his party alleging “inconsistencies and fabrications”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a day later, he conceded defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In any genuine democratic journey, the true test of leadership is not only how we campaign, but how we respond to the verdict of the people,” the Jamaat leader said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part. Hasina, 78, who was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a “historic victory”, while neighbouring India praised Rahman’s “decisive win”, a notable shift after deeply strained ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961852&quot;&gt;souring&lt;/a&gt; of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International election observers said the polls had been a success, with the European Union saying Saturday they had been “credible”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Republican Institute noted that while “election administration was technically sound, the broader political environment remains fragile”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#successful&quot; id=&quot;successful&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Successful’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat’s Rahman said his party “will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; that the vote had been a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was by far the best election,” he said, noting that voting was cancelled at only one of the more than 42,000 polling centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People had doubts about whether a successful election could be held under these circumstances, but we have done it,” he said on Saturday. “If anyone still has any issues, they can go to court.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Election Commission said turnout was 59 percent across 299 constituencies out of 300 in which voting took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only seven women were elected, although a further 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafiqur Rahman stressed the significant gains his party had made compared with past elections, after years of being crushed under Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics,” he said. That is not a setback. That is a foundation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters on Thursday also endorsed proposals in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972702&quot;&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; for a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus, to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean warned that the incoming government now faced “daunting challenges”, including “boosting the economy, ensuring security and continuing the reform process”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#history-that-has-seen-both-challenges-and-cooperation&quot; id=&quot;history-that-has-seen-both-challenges-and-cooperation&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘History that has seen both challenges and cooperation’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Saturday said it looked forward to improved ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on X, the party thanked President Asif Ali Zardari for his “warm congratulations and thoughtful message“.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bdbnp78/status/2022570672971493790&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP noted that while Islamabad and Dhaka share a complex history marked by both challenges and cooperation, “yet our peoples have continued to value dialogue, respect, and regional engagement”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressing optimism about the future, the party said it “remained hopeful that the two nations would further strengthen constructive ties, expand economic collaboration, and enhance people-to-people contacts in the years ahead”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that “closer cooperation could contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous South Asia.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Boycott averted, Pakistan and India set for World Cup blockbuster</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973175/boycott-averted-pakistan-and-india-set-for-world-cup-blockbuster</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and India will clash in the Twenty20 World Cup in Colombo on Sunday, still feeling the aftershocks of a tumultuous fortnight in which Pakistan’s boycott threat - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;later reversed&lt;/a&gt; - nearly blew a hole in the tournament’s marquee fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With bilateral cricket a casualty of their fraught relations, emotions run high whenever the bitter neighbours lock horns in multi-team events at neutral venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968211&quot;&gt;strained relations &lt;/a&gt;with another neighbour, Bangladesh, have further tangled the geopolitics around the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the 20-team field for refusing to tour India over safety concerns, the regional chessboard shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan decided to&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt; boycott &lt;/a&gt;the Group A contest against India in solidarity with Bangladesh, jeopardising a lucrative fixture that sits at the intersection of sport, commerce, and geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with the prospect of losing millions of dollars in evaporating advertising revenue, the broadcasters panicked. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) held hectic behind-the-scenes parleys and eventually brokered a compromise to salvage the tournament’s most sought-after contest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly on cricketing merit, however, the rivalry has been one-sided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defending champions India have a 7-1 record against Pakistan in the tournament’s history and they underlined that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942082&quot;&gt;dominance&lt;/a&gt; at last year’s Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India beat Pakistan three times in that single event, including a stormy final marred by provocative gestures and snubbed handshakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former India captain Rohit Sharma does not believe in the “favourites” tag, especially when the arch-rivals clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s such a funny game,” Rohit, who led India to the title in the T20 World Cup two years ago, recently said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can’t just go and think that it’s a two-point victory for us. You just have to play good cricket on that particular day to achieve those points.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#indias-edge&quot; id=&quot;indias-edge&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;India’s edge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both teams have opened their World Cup campaigns with back-to-back wins, yet India still appears to hold a clear edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opener Abhishek Sharma and spinner Varun Chakravarthy currently top the batting and bowling rankings, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abhishek is doubtful for the Pakistan match, though, as he continues to recover from a stomach infection that kept him out of their first two matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishan Kishan has reinvented himself as a top-order linchpin, skipper Suryakumar Yadav has regained form, while Rinku Singh has settled into the finisher’s role in India’s explosive lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mystery spinner Chakravarthy and the ever-crafty Jasprit Bumrah anchor the spin and pace units, while Hardik Pandya’s all-round spark is pivotal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, opener Sahibzada Farhan has looked in fine form, but Babar Azam’s strike rate continues to polarise opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain Salman Agha will bank on spin-bowling all-rounder Saim Ayub, but the potential trump card is off-spinner Usman Tariq, whose slinging, side-arm action has intrigued opponents and fans alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Rahul Gandhi slammed the India-US trade deal, calling PM Modi &apos;Narendra Surrender Modi&apos; and warning of harm to cotton farmers and textile exporters. He alleged a trap where India faces an 18% tariff on garments while Bangladesh gets 0% by importing US cotton, potentially hurting Indian farmers. Minister Piyush Goyal refuted these claims, stating farmers&apos; interests are protected.</description>

We will get you ground reports from The Hindu’s Kallol Bhattacherjee in Dhaka.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s BNP wins sweeping election majority, promises stability</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890/bangladeshs-bnp-wins-sweeping-election-majority-promises-stability</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won an overwhelming two-thirds majority on Friday in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693&quot;&gt;general elections&lt;/a&gt;, a result expected to bring stability after months of tumult following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ouster&lt;/a&gt; of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951527&quot;&gt;Gen Z-led uprising&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latest counts in a vote seen as the South Asian nation’s first truly competitive election in years gave the BNP and its allies at least 212 of the 299 seats up for grabs, domestic TV channels said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;People look at the results published by Election Commission, following the 13th general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 13, 2026. &amp;mdash; Reuters&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/13100720472f896.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;People look at the results published by Election Commission, following the 13th general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 13, 2026. — Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposition Jamaat-i-Islami and its allies won 70 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Election Commission put the BNP at 181 seats, the Jamaat-i-Islami at 61 and others at 7, with full official results not expected before noon (11am PKT) on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP, which returns to power after 20 years, thanked the people soon and called for special prayers on Friday for the nation and its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite winning … by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,” the party said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Citizen Party (NCP), led by youth activists who played a key role in toppling Hasina and was a part of the Jamaat-led alliance, won just five of the 30 seats it contested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clear outcome had been seen as key for stability in the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million after months of deadly anti-Hasina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1847298&quot;&gt;unrest&lt;/a&gt; disrupted everyday life and industries such as garments, in the export of which Bangladesh is No.2 globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A strong majority gives BNP the parliamentary strength to pass reforms efficiently and avoid legislative paralysis. That alone can create short-term political stability,” Selim Raihan, an economics professor at the University of Dhaka, told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; is widely expected to be sworn in as prime minister. The son of the party’s founder, former president Ziaur Rahman, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; in December to the capital, Dhaka, from 18 years abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its manifesto, the BNP promised to prioritise job creation, protect low-income and marginal households and ensure fair prices to farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the factories run regularly and we get our wages on time, thats what matters to us. I just want the BNP government to bring back stability so more orders come to Bangladesh and we can survive,” Josna Begum, 28, a garment worker and mother of two, told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; after the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamist Jamaat-i-Islami conceded defeat late on Thursday night once trends became clear, but said in a statement on Friday that it was “not satisfied” with the process and asked its followers to stay patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1880581&quot;&gt;exile&lt;/a&gt; in New Delhi, Hasina long dominated Bangladesh politics along with Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, while his father was a leading independence figure who ruled from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP win with more than 200 seats is one of its biggest, surpassing its 2001 victory with 193, although Hasina’s Awami League, which ruled for 15 years and was barred from contesting this time, secured a bigger tally of 230 in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But elections of other years were boycotted by one of the main parties or were contentious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overnight, throngs of supporters cheered and shouted slogans at the BNP headquarters in Dhaka as the scale of the party’s landslide became clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turnout exceeded the 42 per cent of the last election in 2024, with media nearly 60pc of registered voters participated in the election on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 2,000 candidates, many independents among them, were on the ballot, which featured a record number of at least 50 parties. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcaster &lt;em&gt;Jamuna TV&lt;/em&gt; said more than 2 million voters chose “Yes”, while more than 850,000 said “No” in a referendum on constitutional reforms held alongside the election, but there was no official word on the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes include two-term limits for prime ministers and stronger judicial independence and women’s representation while providing for neutral interim governments during election periods, and setting up a second house of the 300-seat parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday extended their felicitations to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its leader, Rahman, on securing a landslide majority in the national elections and receiving the mandate to form the next government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Presidency, the president congratulated the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the polls across 299 seats with the participation of over 127 million registered voters.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaffirming Pakistan’s support for the sovereignty and democratic aspirations of Bangladesh, the president said Pakistan looks forward to working with the new government to strengthen cooperation in trade, defence, cultural exchanges, and regional forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Zardari said the elections in Bangladesh mark an opportunity for South Asia to move beyond past phases in which regional cooperation, including within SAARC, was held hostage by India, which continues to paralyse the great forum that was born in Bangladesh in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed the hope that the new political environment in Dhaka would contribute to more balanced, independent, and mutually respectful engagement across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president conveyed his best wishes for the continued stability, progress, and prosperity of Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a separate message on X, said: “I extend my warmest felicitations to Mr Tarique Rahman on leading the BNP to a resounding victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. I also congratulate the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the elections.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier said he looked forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership further to strengthen our historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations and advance our shared goals of peace, stability, and development in South Asia and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a later post, he said he held a phone call with Rahman following the BNP’s “historic and resounding victory in the general elections”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan looks forward to strengthening its brotherly ties with Bangladesh, building on the legacy of Begum Khaleda Zia, and advancing our  shared goals of peace, progress and prosperity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also congratulated the BNP leader on his victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am confident that, under your able stewardship, Bangladesh will continue its journey towards peace, progress, and prosperity,” he said in a post on X, congratulating the people of Bangladesh on a successful democratic transition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/13/bangladesh-election-bnp-wins</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Voting was largely peaceful in an election seen as a test of Bangladesh’s democracy after years of political turmoil &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist party, led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/12/tarique-rahman-bnp-bangladesh-election&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, has won a sweeping victory in the country’s first election since a gen Z uprising toppled the autocratic regime of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/sheikh-hasina&quot;&gt;Sheikh Hasina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results from the election commission confirmed the BNP alliance had won 212 seats, returning the party to power after 20 years, while the rival alliance, led by the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, won 77 seats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/13/bangladesh-election-bnp-wins&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>T20 World Cup: India and Pakistan fans flock to Colombo, windfall for tourism</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972941/t20-world-cup-india-and-pakistan-fans-flock-to-colombo-windfall-for-tourism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prices of flights and hotel bookings to Colombo, Sri Lanka, have soared as thousands of fans flock to the city to watch India play Pakistan on Sunday in cricket’s Twenty20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neighbouring countries and cricket rivals are due to meet during the group stage of the tournament, which is being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, after Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;reversed &lt;/a&gt;a decision to boycott the match earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game at Sri Lanka’s largest stadium is sold out with roughly 35,000 tickets sold, and ahead of the match, most hotels in Colombo have doubled their prices — the cost of a room has climbed as high as $660 a night from a typical price tag of about $100-$150 per night, multiple booking sites showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the match was finalised this week, last-minute bookings led to fuller flights from major cities like Chennai and Delhi, according to three Colombo travel agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flights from Chennai, which is about one and a half hours away, have more than tripled to around $623-$756, while flights from Delhi are up more than 50 per cent to roughly $666.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nalin Jayasundera, President of Sri Lanka Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO), said hotels were booked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most fans are coming on all-inclusive packages that could be $1,500-$2000 or even higher depending on ticket, hotel, and flight prices,” Jayasundera said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourism is the third largest foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka, famous for its ancient temples, pristine beaches, and lush tea plantations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that hosting more sporting events could boost Sri Lanka’s economic growth, which is recovering from a severe financial crisis and a recent cyclone, which killed 650 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhika Hewawasam, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that in the first 10 days of February, roughly 20pc of the 100,000 visitors to Sri Lanka were there for the India-Pakistan cricket match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island nation is hoping to position itself as a neutral venue for matches between political rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is clearly showing confidence in Sri Lanka as a neutral cricket venue. Whether it’s India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, this is a welcome message to all South Asian countries that they can play cricket in Sri Lanka,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lahore local Mian Sultan is looking forward to his trip to Sri Lanka to watch the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s going to be a great experience, said Sultan, who spent $800 on a front-row seat to watch the game alongside a friend who is flying in from New Zealand. I’m really excited about this match.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sultan added he thought Pakistan absolutely could come out on top on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) announced it will formally demand former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s extradition from India. The move matters because Hasina faces a death sentence for crimes against humanity. This action directly affects Hasina, India, and Bangladesh’s political and legal landscape. Salahuddin Ahmed, a BNP leader elected from Cox’s Bazar-1, told reporters the party [&amp;#8230;]</description>

&lt;p&gt;The decisive mandate secured by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in the country’s 13th parliamentary election marks an inflection point for a nation emerging from institutional exhaustion. After years of concentrated authority under Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League, Bangladesh confronts the dual challenge of restoring democratic credibility and repairing economic drift. A fragmented parliament might [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In Bangladesh’s big election, the BNP scores a major win against the Islamist Jamaat in coalition NCP Gen Z party that ousted Sheikh Hasina. Muhammad Yunus delivers on his promise of elections, but without the Awami League, can the results from Bangladesh’s poll be politically sustainable? And what does it mean for India? We will get you ground reports from The Hindu’s Kallol Bhattacherjee in Dhaka.</description>

                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has decisively won parliamentary elections in Bangladesh, in what was considered the first free and fair national vote in nearly two decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BNP won at least 212 of the 299 seats, the election commission said on Friday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coalition of opposition parties led by Jamaat-e-Islami won 77 seats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The victory of the BNP means its leader Tarique Rahman is poised to follow in the footsteps of both his parents and lead Bangladesh.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahman is the son of Khaleda Zia, the former prime minister, and Ziaur Rahman, the assassinated former president.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Despite winning... by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,&quot; the BNP said on Friday, asking voters to offer prayers instead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh has been in a period of turbulence since Sheikh Hasina, the former longtime prime minister, was removed following a student-led uprising in August 2024. She is currently in exile in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the country has been governed by an interim administration led by Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace laureate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hasina&apos;s second stint in office from 2009 until her ouster in 2024 was marred by arrests of political opponents, the silencing of dissenting voices and accusations of human rights abuses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November, a court sentenced her to death in absentia over crimes against humanity when ordering a deadly crackdown on student-led protesters. Hasina&apos;s Awami League was banned from the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamaat, which formed an alliance that included youth activists in the National Citizen Party, had been expected to do well but ultimately fell short.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It conceded defeat, though said on Friday that it was &quot;not satisfied&quot; with the process of vote counting in some constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its defeat, it still marks Jamaat&apos;s highest ever tally of seats in parliament, 70, and the first time it has contested elections since being banned by Hasina in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;India and Pakistan congratulate BNP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahman is set to become the first male non-interim prime minister of Bangladesh in over 35 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years of exile spent in London.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His party has campaigned on job creation, protection for low-income households and securing fair prices for farmers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some voters, Rahman was seen as a continuation of the dynastic politics which has dominated Bangladesh since it became an independent country in 1971.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India, Pakistan and the US congratulated the BNP on its victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ties between India and Bangladesh, traditionally close allies, have soured in recent months, particularly over New Delhi&apos;s refusal to extradite Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turnout for the election was reported as just under 60 percent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside parliamentary elections, a referendum on constitutional reforms championed by interim leader Yunus was also held.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reforms included introducing two-term limits for prime ministers, stronger judicial independence and female representation, providing neutral interim governments during election periods as well as setting up a new second chamber.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no official outcome on the referendum by Friday afternoon, though media reported that early indications suggest it would pass comfortably by over 65 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reforms were designed to prevent autocratic leaders and governments seizing power in future.&lt;/p&gt;

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who led the interim government after a 2024 uprising, is expected to step down.

      <description>Bangladesh’s general election brings the BNP to power, signaling political stability, with Tarique Rahman set to become prime minister. The outcome could boost investor confidence. However, the country must diversify its economy beyond garment exports, a critical step as Bangladesh prepares to graduate from least developed country status.

      <title>In pictures: Bangladesh a day after polls — BNP poised to form government</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972909/in-pictures-bangladesh-a-day-after-polls-bnp-poised-to-form-government</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) claimed a thumping win on Friday in the first elections held since a deadly 2024 uprising, with leader Tarique Rahman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;poised&lt;/a&gt; to become prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But final official results are yet to come and BNP’s main rival Jamaat-i-Islami — leading a wider coalition — said it had “serious questions about the integrity of the results process”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Jamuna&lt;/em&gt; television channel projected that the BNP had secured 212 seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said Jamaat had won 74, a huge leap from its past results but far short of the outright win it had campaigned for. &lt;em&gt;Somoy&lt;/em&gt; TV broadcast similar figures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What are the key priorities of the BNP, winner of the Bangladesh election?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh National Party (BNP)&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890/bangladeshs-bnp-wins-big-in-historic-parliamentary-election&quot;&gt; won&lt;/a&gt; a decisive two-thirds majority on Friday in general elections, a result expected to bring stability to the nation after months of tumult following the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-led uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party, led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, will return to power after 20 years. Rahman, the son of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman, is widely expected to be sworn in as prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key promises made by the BNP in its election manifesto, which has the motto ‘Bangladesh before all’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#reforms&quot; id=&quot;reforms&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reforms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party aims to implement all points of the July Charter, which sought to create new constitutional bodies, introduce a bicameral parliament, along with broader changes in line with political parties’ commitments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key promises made includes undertaking initiatives to restart closed industries and diversify the export sector. The party has also vowed to undertake measures so that legally operating foreign businesses can repatriate their stipulated profits to their home countries within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#employment&quot; id=&quot;employment&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Employment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On employment, the BNP has promised to create nearly 1 million new jobs in the information and communication technology sector. They have also promised to ensure fair, price-index-based wages in line with inflation and a review system to be launched every two years.&lt;/p&gt;
