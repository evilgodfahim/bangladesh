      <title>Assault On The Aravallis: Development Models India Must Eschew</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/assault-aravallis-development-models-india-must-eschew</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;India today sits at the bottom of the rank of countries in the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), which combines a range of indicators like climate change mitigation, air pollution, waste management, sustainability of fisheries and agriculture, deforestation, and biodiversity protection. The EPI is produced by centres working under Yale and Columbia universities. The 2024 listing showed India at rank 176 out of 180, just ahead of Pakistan (rank 179) but behind Bangladesh (175), China (156), and Sri Lanka (134).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Just a handshake</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964530/just-a-handshake</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;IT was a handshake that sent a ripple through the region. On Wednesday, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964291&quot;&gt;shook hands in Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;, where they had both arrived to attend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964271&quot;&gt;state funeral of former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;passed away &lt;/a&gt;earlier this week. It was, doubtless, a significant moment which invited attention across three countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chief Adviser of the Government of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/ChiefAdviserGoB/status/2006340330585833665&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made note of it in a post on his X account&lt;/a&gt;, which stated that the two men had “exchanged greetings” during their interaction ahead of the funeral programme organised for Ms Zia. Pictures of the two, sombrely attired for the occasion, accompanied his post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian media downplayed the event, framing the handshake as a usual nicety at such events and therefore inconsequential. The Pakistani media, noting that it was the first high-level contact between the two nations since the May hostilities, ran with the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/NAofPakistan/status/2006331508479664546&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement issued by the National Assembly Secretariat&lt;/a&gt;, underlining the part where it claimed that the handshake and pleasantries had been initiated by Mr Jaishankar, who reportedly approached Mr Sadiq with an informal acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason for the interest could be that this is a slow time of the year for newsrooms. Another could be that anticipation has continuously been high for what happens next between Pakistan and India. Yet, given the prevailing atmosphere, not much can or should be read into a mere handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the NA Secretariat’s statement on the ‘handshake’ notes that Pakistan has “consistently emphasised dialogue, restraint and cooperative measures, including proposals for peace talks and joint investigations into the alleged false flag Pahalgam incident, in order to prevent unprovoked aggression and escalation”. Can this be read as a signal to New Delhi that the door to talks remains open?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the hostile rhetoric and posturing from next door show no signs of relenting. Recent reports regarding plans for controversial hydropower projects by India, which would violate the Indus Waters Treaty, are designed to be provocations for further tensions between the two states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, without question, a strong need for temperatures to be brought down. But handshakes and exchanging pleasantries alone will not make that happen. It will require earnest effort, especially on New Delhi’s part, and diplomacy at the highest levels before a thaw can be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

Congress has stepped in to defend Khan, labeling the criticism an attack on India&apos;s pluralism. The debate highlights differing views on nationalism and inclusion,</description>

                &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-subhead&quot;&gt;The European Court of Human Rights issued a new challenge against the UK&apos;s decision to strip Begum of her citizenship amid concerns she was groomed and trafficked into Syria&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-cutline&quot;&gt;A source told the BBC that British Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will prioritise national security and not restore Shamima Begum&apos;s UK citizenship (AFP)&lt;/div&gt;

                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has vowed to “robustly defend” the Conservative Party’s decision to revoke the citizenship of a British woman who fled to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/syria&quot;&gt;Syria&lt;/a&gt; as a 15-year-old to join the Islamic State (IS) group after a European Court challenged the move. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A government source told the BBC that Mahmood will defend the decision to strip &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-supreme-court-refuse-hear-shamima-begum-appeal&quot;&gt;Shamima Begum&lt;/a&gt; of her citizenship after the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) asked the Home Office whether ministers considered Begum was a victim of trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The home secretary will robustly defend the decision to revoke Shamima Begum’s citizenship, which has been tested and upheld time and again in our domestic courts,” said the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The home secretary will always put this country’s national security first.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last December, the Strasbourg court &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/shamima-begum-uk-citizenship-european-court-human-rights-challenges-uk-government-citizenship-stripping&quot;&gt;sent a series of questions &lt;/a&gt;to the UK government, asking whether it broke anti-trafficking obligations when it stripped Begum of her citizenship in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions include whether the government violated Article 4 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which prohibits slavery, servitude and forced labour, as well as a state’s duty to prevent and investigate trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Former Northern Ireland lord chief justice says UK wrong to strip Shamima Begum of citizenship&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/former-northern-irish-lord-chief-justice-says-uk-wrong-strip-shamima-begum-citizenship&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped Begum of her citizenship on national security grounds after his office argued that the deprivation was “conducive to the public good” and she posed a threat to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javid also justified the decision to strip her British citizenship on the grounds that Begum qualified for a Bangladeshi passport because of her parents’ heritage, despite never visiting or living in the South Asian country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begum made headlines when she fled to Syria in 2015 to join IS with two school friends from her East London home. She then reappeared four years later, at an advanced stage of pregnancy, after journalists tracked her down in IS territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Begum has tried multiple times, in a series of legal battles with the UK government, to regain her British citizenship, none of which have succeeded, while being held in a prison camp in northern Syria controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECHR is now assessing whether the Home Office failed to take into account whether she was a victim of trafficking, and if removing her citizenship could have prevented the government from fulfilling its duty to investigate how she was allowed to leave the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&apos;Catalogue of failures&apos;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their application to the Strasbourg court, Begum’s lawyers said the decision violated Article 4 of the ECHR and that the UK authorities failed to ask four questions before depriving her of her citizenship: whether she had been trafficked to Syria; whether British authorities failed to protect her; whether her deprivation of citizenship would undermine any future investigation into potential trafficking; and, if trafficking issues were present, whether deprivation could be justified on national-security grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birnberg Peirce, the law firm that is representing Begum, described the ECHR’s intervention as an “unprecedented opportunity” for the UK government to assess whether previous administrations ignored or sidestepped the considerations to be taken into account to strip her of her citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Strasbourg’s communication presents an unprecedented opportunity for the UK as well as for Ms Begum to grapple with the significant considerations raised in her case and ignored, sidestepped or violated up to now by previous UK administrations,” said&amp;nbsp;lawyer&amp;nbsp;Gareth Peirce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is impossible to dispute that a 15-year-old British child was in 2014/15 lured, encouraged and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to ISIL-controlled territory for the known purpose of being given, as a child, to an ISIL fighter to propagate children for the Islamic State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The police failed to warn families, informed the school that its apprehension of risk was overstated, conducted no safeguarding measures, delayed contact with ports and known routes of travel to trigger alarms and prevent [them] reaching the known destination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, Declan Morgan, the former lord chief justice of Northern Ireland, said Britain&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/former-northern-irish-lord-chief-justice-says-uk-wrong-strip-shamima-begum-citizenship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;should not have stripped&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Begum of her citizenship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan, who serves as a a supplementary panel member of the UK Supreme Court, made the remarks&amp;nbsp; at the launch of a new&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/sweeping-uk-terror-law-label-harmful-behaviour-terrorism-prevent-overhaul&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by the Independent Commission on UK Counter-Terrorism Law, Policy and Practice, which he chairs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Special Immigration Appeals Court (SIAC) found that conditions in the prison camp where Begum is being arbitrarily detained without trial constituted inhuman and degrading treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years later, SIAC also found that the state failed to protect her but noted that its “hands were tied” as a result of the Supreme Court’s limiting the immigration court’s ability to take into consideration the merits of Begum’s case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECHR’s intervention comes as activists ramp up their campaigning against the UK’s growing use of citizenship-stripping powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final judgement is expected at a later date, following submissions from the UK government and Begum’s lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NA Speaker Sadiq, Indian FM Jaishankar shake hands in Dhaka in first high-level contact since May conflict</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964291/na-speaker-sadiq-indian-fm-jaishankar-shake-hands-in-dhaka-in-first-high-level-contact-since-may-conflict</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Speaker of the National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar shook hands in Dhaka on Wednesday, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations between Islamabad and New Delhi reached their lowest point this year following an attack in Pahalagam, in Indian-occupied Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan, while Islamabad denied any connection and offered — and continues to offer — an independent probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A press release from the NA Secretariat stated that during Sadiq’s visit to Dhaka for former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia’s funeral, Jaishankar approached him for a handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indian External Minister Dr S Jaishankar approached the Speaker [of the] National Assembly and shaked hands,” the press release read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During this interaction, Dr S Jaishankar introduced himself to the speaker and told the speaker that he had recognised him [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;].”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NAofPakistan/status/2006331508479664546&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press release added that since the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan has “consistently emphasised dialogue, restraint and cooperative measures, including proposals for peace talks and joint investigations into the alleged false flag Pahalgam incident, in order to prevent unprovoked aggression and escalation“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Pahalgam incident, India took a raft of unilateral diplomatic measures against Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the Indian measures, the suspension of the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTs/Volume%20419/volume-419-I-6032-English.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Indus Waters Treaty&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (IWT) stood out as the most severe. The 1960 pact, brokered by the World Bank, has endured through wars and decades of hostility. Its suspension, therefore, marked a watershed moment in the already fraught relationship between the nuclear-armed neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India further lowered diplomatic ties by closing down the main border transit point, framing the attack as a grave provocation that warranted significant diplomatic, economic, and logistical pressure on Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan called for an independent and transparent investigation into the attack, strongly denying India’s accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, New Delhi launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;deadly air strikes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of a four-day clash between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;tit-for-tat strikes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reach a ceasefire&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;issued&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had sounded the alarm on New Delhi’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961827&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;variations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the flow of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which caused consternation among farmers in Punjab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1920727&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reaffirmed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute-resolution mechanisms. In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh mourns ex-PM Khaleda Zia with state funeral</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964271/bangladesh-mourns-ex-pm-khaleda-zia-with-state-funeral</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh bade farewell on Wednesday to former prime minister Khaleda Zia in a state funeral drawing vast crowds, mourning a towering leader whose career defined politics for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda, the first woman to serve as prime minister in the South Asian nation of 170 million people,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt; died&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday aged 80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flags were flown at half-mast, and thousands of security officers lined the streets as her body was carried through the streets of the capital Dhaka in a vehicle in the colours of the national flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large crowds had gathered outside parliament — many waving national flags or those of Khaleda’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — where the funeral prayers were &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/passing-khaleda-zia/news/khaleda-zias-body-taken-gulshan-flag-draped-vehicle-4069821&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;held&lt;/a&gt; at around 3pm local time, according to Dhaka-based &lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChiefAdviserGoB/status/2006315795283083711&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda was laid to rest alongside her late husband, Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981 during his time as president. The burial took place at around 4:30pm local time, &lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy-year-old retired government official Minhaz Uddin, who was attending Khaleda’s funeral, said he had never voted for her, but came to honour the three-time prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I came here with my grandson, just to say goodbye to a veteran politician whose contributions will always be remembered,” he said, watching from behind a barbed wire barricade as her body passed by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Khaleda Zia has been an inspiration,” mourner Sharmina Siraj told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;, adding that “it is difficult to imagine women in leadership positions anytime soon”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 40-year-old mother of two said stipends introduced by Khaleda to support girls’ education “had a huge impact on the lives of our girls”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, who is in Bangladesh for the funeral, visited the residence of the former Bangladeshi prime minister, where he met her son and daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat, Sadiq expressed his condolences at the passing of their mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this hour of grief and sorrow, the government and the people of Pakistan stand with you,” he was quoted as saying. The family of the late premier thanked Sadiq for his condolences.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NA speaker also met the country’s national security adviser, Khalilur Rehman, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said that Sadiq “conveyed a message of sympathy and condolences on behalf of the residents and prime minister of Pakistan”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker also met the adviser for law, justice and parliamentary affairs of Bangladesh, Asif Nazrul, where the two discussed matters of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, a post on the NA‘s X account said Sadiq also had an interaction with Indian Foreign Minister Dr S, Jaishankar at Bangladesh’s parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#legacy-lives-on&quot; id=&quot;legacy-lives-on&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Legacy lives on’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959216&quot;&gt;ill health&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1388124&quot;&gt; imprisonment&lt;/a&gt;, Khaleda had vowed to campaign in elections set for 12 February — the first vote since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party is widely seen as a frontrunner, and her son Tarique Rahman, 60, who returned only last week after 17 years in exile, is seen as a potential prime minister if they win a majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She is no more, but her legacy lives on — and so does the BNP,” said Jenny Parvez, 37, who travelled for several hours with her family to watch the funeral cortege pass her on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interim government, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, declared three days of national mourning and an elaborate state funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus said Bangladesh had “lost a great guardian”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#unbreakable&quot; id=&quot;unbreakable&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Unbreakable’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarique Rahman said in a statement that “the country mourns the loss of a guiding presence that shaped its democratic aspirations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mother, he added, “endured repeated arrests, denial of medical care, and relentless persecution”, but that “her resilience … was unbreakable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering from a raft of health issues, Khaleda was rushed to hospital in late November, where her condition had gradually deteriorated despite treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, hours before her death, party workers had on Monday submitted nomination papers on her behalf for three constituencies for next year’s polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he hoped Khaleda’s “vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership”, a warm message despite the strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka since Hasina’s fall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Why return of Zia’s son may influence Bangladesh’s election</title>

      <description>The death of Bangladesh’s three-time former prime minister Khaleda Zia just days after her son Tarique Rahman returned from a 17-year exile has created a groundswell of sympathy for the family, with analysts saying Zia’s legacy may tilt the country’s February election in favour of her party.
With the polls set to be the first since student-led protests toppled the government of Zia’s long-time rival, Sheikh Hasina, and the Awami League barred from contesting, analysts said Zia’s death on Tuesday...</description>

      <title>2025 — Pakistan’s year of water wars</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963930/2025-pakistans-year-of-water-wars</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will remember 2025 for a couple of reasons. One, and most pivotal of them, is water, and not because of a single catastrophic event, but because multiple hydrological, political, and climatic crises converged simultaneously, dismantling the long-held assumption that water management is merely a technical or seasonal concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the year, water moved decisively into the realm of national security, federal cohesion, public health, and regional diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan entered 2025 with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1886804&quot;&gt;drier-than-average winter&lt;/a&gt;, slid rapidly into one of the most severe heatwave seasons on record, endured compound monsoon disasters, and concluded the year facing unprecedented transboundary water hostility on both its eastern and western borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges, however, were not just external. Internally, long-standing inter-provincial distrust over water allocation erupted into mass protests, as Sindh confronted an existential crisis spanning agriculture, access to drinking water, coastal survival, and deteriorating infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, we take a closer look at all that unfolded this year to make 2025 a turning point in Pakistan’s water history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#transboundary-hydropolitics&quot; id=&quot;transboundary-hydropolitics&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Transboundary hydropolitics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Indus Waters Treaty shock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the Indus Water Treaty, forged by an unlikely alliance of world powers in 1960, withstood over six decades, survived wars, and braved diplomatic crises, serving as a stunning example of international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that, however, collapsed in 2025, when on April 23, India formally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075&quot;&gt;placed the treaty in abeyance&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source&quot;&gt;Pahalgam attack&lt;/a&gt;. The immediate consequence was not the physical diversion of river flows, but the suspension of hydrological data sharing, which is an essential pillar for flood forecasting, reservoir operations, and irrigation planning in downstream Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss of advanced flow information during an exceptionally volatile monsoon season sharply increased downstream flood risk and operational uncertainty. Although Pakistan managed information through alternative national and international sources, India’s posture in water diplomacy appeared increasingly irresponsible, signalling an attempt to weaponise water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weaponisation of water and consistent threats were met with an appropriate and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1953682&quot;&gt;timely response &lt;/a&gt;from Pakistan, which involved declaring any unilateral diversion of western rivers an act of war and marking an unprecedented securitisation of water. Although international arbitration processes continued and interpretative rulings were issued later in the year, the treaty’s normative authority was thoroughly weakened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The western frontier: Afghanistan and the Kunar River&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While attention remained fixed on India, a quieter but equally destabilising hydrological threat emerged on Pakistan’s western frontier. In October 2025, the Taliban administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1950983&quot;&gt;ordered &lt;/a&gt;the immediate construction of a major dam on the Kunar River, a tributary that provides the bulk of the flow to the Kabul River system, sustaining large parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a formal water-sharing treaty between Pakistan and Afghanistan, bilateral water relations rely on customary practices that are now under visible strain. Few voices in Pakistan called for the counter-diversion of the Chitral River, signalling how water infrastructure has begun to function as a strategic instrument in an increasingly volatile regional landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#inter-provincial-water-governance&quot; id=&quot;inter-provincial-water-governance&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Inter-provincial water governance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestically, 2025 exposed the fragility of Pakistan’s federal water compact. The launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1892713&quot;&gt;Green Pakistan Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, aimed at converting millions of acres of land into corporate farmland through new irrigation canals, triggered the most intense inter-provincial water conflict in decades. The proposed Cholistan Canal became the central flashpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sindh’s opposition was grounded in hydrological reality: there is no demonstrable surplus water in the Indus system capable of sustaining new large-scale irrigation without reducing downstream flows. Political leaders, farmers, lawyers, and civil society framed the project as a violation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1922326&quot;&gt;1991 Water Apportionment Accord&lt;/a&gt; and a direct threat to Sindh’s agriculture and the already collapsing Indus Delta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass protests, highway blockades, and resolutions passed in the Sindh Assembly reflected a rare province-wide consensus that upstream water diversion had become an existential issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with escalating unrest, the federal government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1906331&quot;&gt;halted &lt;/a&gt;canal construction in late April, a decision later formalised by the Council of Common Interests (CCI). The body returned provisional approvals and directed that no new canal could proceed without full provincial consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this intervention reaffirmed constitutional federalism, it did not eliminate underlying structural tensions. Corporate agriculture remains a federal priority, while inter-provincial trust remains deeply eroded. Even technically successful reservoir management later in the year could not fully restore confidence in allocation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#from-climatic-extremes-to-systemic-failures&quot; id=&quot;from-climatic-extremes-to-systemic-failures&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From climatic extremes to systemic failures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1944130&quot;&gt;came the floods&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most consequential hydrological events since 2022, not because of the physical damage they caused but because they exposed systematic failures in water governance, infrastructure planning, and disaster preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a single flood pulse, 2025 witnessed a sequence of high-intensity rainfall events, sudden upstream releases, massive landslides and urban drainage collapse, producing cascading flood risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monsoon began earlier than average in late June and extended deep into September, marked by intense cloudburst events. On July 17, Rawalpindi received approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1924943&quot;&gt;230 millimetres of rainfall&lt;/a&gt; within 24 hours, overwhelming drainage systems and inundating urban settlements. Similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1938525&quot;&gt;flash flooding occurred across KP and northern Punjab&lt;/a&gt;, where steep catchments rapidly converted rainfall into destructive flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riverine flooding followed as exceptional rainfall in the upper Indus Basin coincided with reduced predictability in upstream releases. In late August, sudden discharges — particularly on the Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab rivers — combined with local rainfall to inundate large tracts of Punjab. Satellite analysis later confirmed that more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1940647&quot;&gt;1.3 million hectares of farmland were submerged&lt;/a&gt;, severely damaging rice, cotton, and sugarcane crops.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;This aerial view shows partially submerged residential buildings following the overflowing of the Ravi River in Lahore on August 30, 2025. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sindh, on the other hand, experienced a different flood dynamic. After entering the year under drought conditions, the province faced rapid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942352&quot;&gt;river swelling at Guddu and Sukkur barrages&lt;/a&gt;. Emergency discharges forced evacuations of around 150,000 people from vulnerable riverine areas, illustrating the absence of adaptive operational management under extreme variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, the floods claimed over 1,000 lives, displaced more than six million people, and damaged critical infrastructure. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1944130&quot;&gt;economic impact &lt;/a&gt;was severe, with flood-related disruptions shaving an estimated 0.5 per cent off national GDP. Beyond immediate destruction, floodwaters mobilised sewage, industrial effluents, and agro-chemicals, contaminating drinking water sources and triggering post-flood disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overarching lesson was stark: floods in Pakistan are no longer episodic natural disasters but systemic stress tests, exposing the same governance failures with increasing intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#droughts-to-floods&quot; id=&quot;droughts-to-floods&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Droughts to floods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sindh embodied the contradictions of 2025 more acutely than any other province. Early &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1898669&quot;&gt;Kharif water shortages&lt;/a&gt;, now a recurring feature, once again reduced cotton sowing and devastated mango orchards at critical growth stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the year progressed, the irrigation crisis morphed into a public health emergency. In rural areas, women and children travelled long distances to collect saline and contaminated water. In cities, reliance on water tankers surged beyond affordability. Only about a quarter of Sindh’s population had access to safely managed drinking water, while water-borne diseases increased silently.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Women clear wastage from cotton fibers in Kabirwala, Pakistan September 18, 2025. — Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Indus Delta continued its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1895480&quot;&gt;slow collapse&lt;/a&gt;. Insufficient freshwater flows below Kotri accelerated seawater intrusion, rendering fertile land unproductive and displacing more than 1.2 million people over the past two decades. Mangrove loss, collapse of fisheries, and salinisation transformed large areas into ecological dead zones, fuelling migration toward already overstressed cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It increasingly appears that the delta no longer belongs to anyone. Even in 2025, when relatively improved flows reached the delta, voices emerged claiming that water had been “wasted” by flowing to the sea — an outlook that is anti-river, anti-resilience, anti-sustainability, and ultimately anti-people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, investigations into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1843096&quot;&gt;Sukkur Barrage gate failures &lt;/a&gt;exposed years of deferred maintenance. Fortunately, a major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962471&quot;&gt;rehabilitation and modernisation project&lt;/a&gt; was already underway. Even with the progress in 2025, the system remains under significant stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Karachi, the K-IV project reached only 64pc completion despite massive expenditure, while demand continued to exceed supply by nearly 550 MGD. Moreover,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1916618&quot;&gt; serious questions remain&lt;/a&gt; about whether the project’s design and execution will translate into the intended outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#the-question-of-water-governance&quot; id=&quot;the-question-of-water-governance&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The question of water governance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.adb.org/awdo/editions/2025&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Asian Water Development Outlook&lt;/a&gt; (AWDO), released by the Asian Development Bank, brought yet another water reality to the fore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report placed Pakistan near the bottom of regional water security rankings, underscoring that the country’s water crisis stems less from absolute scarcity and more from persistent governance failure. Assessing 50 economies across rural, urban, economic, environmental, and disaster dimensions, the document showed that Pakistan’s National Water Security Index improved by only 6.4 points between 2013 and 2025 — below the regional average and far behind neighbours such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rural water security remains in the second-lowest tier, marked by poor water quality, limited piped supply, sanitation deficits, and a high burden of water-borne disease, reflecting weak integration of WASH into climate adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban water security is even more alarming: despite marginal gains, Pakistan’s urban drainage score fell to zero, highlighting chronic flooding, unplanned expansion, and infrastructural decay, exemplified by Karachi’s persistent supply deficits and informal tanker economy. Economic water security stagnated, while environmental water security deteriorated most visibly in the shrinking Indus Delta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings reinforce the central lesson of 2025: Pakistan’s water crisis is no longer defined by scarcity alone, but by the growing unsafety of its water and the inequitable, opaque systems through which it is governed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#10-imperatives-for-2026&quot; id=&quot;10-imperatives-for-2026&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;10 imperatives for 2026&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lived experience of 2025 leaves little room for ambiguity and yields ten unavoidable priorities for 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, water must be recognised and governed explicitly as a national security issue that have country level consensus, not merely as a sectoral or engineering concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Pakistan must urgently develop a defensive and adaptive approach to transboundary water challenges, one that not just prepares for uncertainty, but also internationally works for basin-level thinking to save the lives, especially those of people belonging to less privileged backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, inter-provincial water governance must be rebuilt on transparent, publicly accessible data and genuine constitutional consensus, without which technical decisions will continue to provoke political resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, water quality must be elevated from a neglected environmental concern to a full-fledged public health emergency, integrated into health planning, nutrition outcomes, and productivity assessments. This leads us towards the fifth priority: groundwater — now Pakistan’s primary source of water for households and agriculture — must be governed as a shared public resource instead of an unregulated private commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixth, urban water governance, particularly in Karachi, must shift decisively from emergency coping mechanisms toward durable institutional reform, equitable distribution, and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventh, environmental flows to the Indus Delta must be legally guaranteed and treated as essential for human survival, ecological stability, and coastal security, rather than as surplus water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighth, women must be integrated as active decision-makers in water planning and management, recognising their central role beyond the invisible labour of water collection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; Residents work at a damaged property, following monsoon rains and flooding, in Punjab on September 17, 2025. &amp;mdash; Reuters &quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/311140220f5a373.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Residents work at a damaged property, following monsoon rains and flooding, in Punjab on September 17, 2025. — Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, two things that require immediate attention: climate adaptation must be fully mainstreamed into all water planning, replacing reliance on historical averages with scenario-based, flexible, and risk-informed approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, water policy must be anchored in social justice, ensuring that access to safe water is upheld as a fundamental right rather than reduced to a market commodity determined by income and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydrological turbulence of 2025 was not an anomaly; it was a preview. It revealed what happens when fractured water diplomacy, internal mistrust, decaying infrastructure, and climate volatility collide. Water is no longer a sector to be managed; it is a constraint on Pakistan’s survival. Whether 2026 becomes a year of reform or repetition depends on whether the lessons of 2025 are heeded or willfully ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Khaleda Zia&apos;s India legacy softens amid new equations</title>

      <description>Khaleda Zia&apos;s death creates a political void in Bangladesh, with her son Tarique Rahman poised to lead the BNP.  While past BNP rule saw strained India ties and ISI influence, Rahman&apos;s recent shift may suggest a more liberal, India-friendly stance. This evolution could reshape upcoming elections and regional dynamics.</description>

      <title>Injured Archer included in England T20 World Cup squad but no place for Smith</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964110/injured-archer-included-in-england-t20-world-cup-squad-but-no-place-for-smith</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fast bowler Jofra Archer was included in England’s provisional T20 World Cup squad announced on Tuesday, despite suffering a left side strain that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962981&quot;&gt;ruled him out of&lt;/a&gt; the final two Ashes Tests, but there was no place for wicketkeeper Jamie Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archer’s fellow quick Josh Tongue has been called up to the T20 squad for the first time in a 15-man party to be captained by Harry Brook for the tournament in India and Sri Lanka beginning on February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archer will sit out the warm-up tour to Sri Lanka next month to continue his rehabilitation following the injury he sustained during the third Ashes Test in Adelaide earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brydon Carse will replace Archer in Sri Lanka for three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 internationals beginning on January 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no place, however, in the T20 World Cup squad for Smith who has endured a torrid Ashes tour of Australia, for all that is an unusual starting point in deciding selection for a white-ball tournament in the sub-continent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/englandcricket/status/2005906710309798248?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Surrey wicketkeeper-batsman smashed 60 from 26 balls in his last T20 appearance against the West Indies in June, but was rested due to his heavy all-format workload from the subsequent series against South Africa and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963379&quot;&gt;four Tests &lt;/a&gt;in Australia where he has averaged a lowly 19.85 with the bat and endured several struggles behind the stumps, he has been left out entirely, with the experienced Jos Buttler and Phil Salt providing England with keeping options for 2024 T20 World Cup semi-finalists England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tongue, by contrast, has never played white-ball cricket but has enhanced his reputation with impressive Ashes displays in Adelaide and Melbourne, where a England’s four-wicket win still left them 3-1 down heading into a series finale at Sydney starting Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the 28-year-old was the top wicket-taker in last season’s Hundred competition, taking 14 wickets in just six games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test-match opening batsman Zak Crawley returns to the ODI squad for the first time since December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brook will lead his first World Cup campaign as white-ball captain, with England facing Bangladesh, West Indies, Italy and Nepal in Group C, with both managing director Rob Key and coach Brendon McCullum looking for an impressive showing after they came in for criticism following the Test team’s tame Ashes series loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;England T20 squad for World Cup squad and Sri Lanka tour:&lt;/strong&gt; Harry Brook (capt), Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler (wkt), Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Josh Tongue, Luke Wood, Brydon Carse (Sri Lanka tour only)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;England ODI squad for Sri Lanka tour:&lt;/strong&gt; Harry Brook (capt), Rehan Ahmed, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler (wkt), Brydon Carse, Zak Crawley, Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Luke Wood&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What drove gen Z protests that brought down governments and called out corruption? Five activists explain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We spoke to protesters in Togo, Kenya, Nepal, Madagascar and Morocco about how their actions helped shape the world in 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass protests in Nepal and Madagascar toppled both governments this year, even when the young people at the forefront of the demonstrations were faced with heavily armed police and the threat of arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many called 2025 the year of the protest although the revolution in Bangladesh in 2024 that unseated the authoritarian leader Sheikh Hasina is often credited with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;inspiring young people to take to the streets across parts of Asia and Africa. Although not all achieved the change they wanted, from Sri Lanka to Timor-Leste they shared a common factor: gen Z was the driving force.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/30/gen-z-protests-corruption-five-activists-nepal-madagascar-togo-kenya-morocco-protesters&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, dies at 80 after prolonged illness</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087/khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-dies-at-80-after-prolonged-illness</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the &lt;em&gt;Fajr&lt;/em&gt; prayer,” the party said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim leader Muhammad Yunus said Bangladesh “has lost a great guardian”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Through her uncompromising leadership, the nation was repeatedly freed from undemocratic conditions and inspired to regain liberty,” the Nobel Peace Prize winner said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I pray for the eternal peace and forgiveness of Begum Khaleda Zia’s soul,” ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina said, in a statement on social media by her now banned Awami League party.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;her arch-rival Hasina last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in late November, she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958157&quot;&gt;rushed to hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned to Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#bangladesh-declares-three-day-state-mourning&quot; id=&quot;bangladesh-declares-three-day-state-mourning&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bangladesh declares three-day state mourning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh declared three days of state mourning, with Khaleda’s funeral to be held on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim leader Yunus, in a television broadcast to the nation, appealed for calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I humbly appeal to everyone to maintain discipline while observing all forms of mourning, including the funeral prayers. I know you are all deeply emotional at this time,” Yunus said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope that during this difficult period, you will show utmost patience and support one another in carrying out her last rites, including the funeral.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asif Nazrul, who holds the law portfolio in the interim government, said the funeral prayers would be held in front of parliament after midday prayers, and that Zia would then be buried alongside her late husband, Ziaur Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#committed-friend-to-pakistan&quot; id=&quot;committed-friend-to-pakistan&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Committed friend to Pakistan’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened by Khaleda’s passing. “Her lifelong service to Bangladesh and its growth and development leaves a lasting legacy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Begum Zia was a committed friend of Pakistan. My government and the people of Pakistan stand with the people of Bangladesh in this moment of sorrow,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends and the people of Bangladesh during this difficult time,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said Khaleda’s “leadership and services will be remembered with respect”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also expressed his condolences at Khaleda’s passing.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he hoped Zia’s “vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership”, a warm message despite the strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka since Hasina’s fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#battling-begums&quot; id=&quot;battling-begums&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Battling begums’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years later she became the head of the BNP, which her husband had founded, and vowed to deliver on his aim of “liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh’s founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their cooperation did not last long. Their bitter rivalry would lead to the two being dubbed “the battling begums”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters saw her as polite and traditional yet quietly stylish, someone who chose her words carefully. But they also viewed her as a bold, uncompromising leader when it came to defending her party and confronting her rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, by contrast, was far more outspoken and assertive. Their opposite personalities helped fuel the rivalry that dominated Bangladesh’s politics for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the Jamaat-e-Islami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Benazir Bhutto, who was elected three years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.&lt;br /&gt;She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her second term was marred by the rise of militants and allegations of corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 wounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda’s government and its allies were widely blamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, after Hasina had reclaimed Bangladesh’s highest office, Rahman was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP denounced the trial as politically motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#detention-and-freedom&quot; id=&quot;detention-and-freedom&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Detention and freedom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Khaleda later clamped down on radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda never regained power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the BNP boycotting the 2014 and 2024 elections, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tension between their two parties often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding the economic development of Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country of about 175 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Khaleda, Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister — charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda was freed from house arrest in August 2024 after Hasina’s ouster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2025, Khaleda and Rahman were acquitted by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Afghan Taliban visit Bangladesh ahead of elections</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964043/afghan-taliban-visit-bangladesh-ahead-of-elections</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Senior envoy meets religious leaders in push for political clout&lt;br /&gt;• Religious parties eye resurgence in February polls&lt;br /&gt;• Bangladeshi officials label trip as ‘personal’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Afghan Taliban officials have held meetings with religious leaders in Bangladesh during a visit aimed at expanding political ties, officials in Dhaka said on Monday, as the country’s leaders manoeuvre for influence ahead of elections due in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kabul’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Director General Noor Ahmad Noor met senior figures including Mamunul Haque, leader of the Khelafat-i-Majlish party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meetings took place during a week-long stay that comes at a sensitive time for the South Asian nation, which is navigating a fragile transition under an interim government. Haque told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; that Noor had visited the seminary he oversees. “It was a courtesy call, as we run one of the largest madrassas in the country,” Haque said. “He visited some other madrassas as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While religious diplomacy appea­red central to the itinerary, trade was also on the agenda. Abu Sayem Kha­led, president of the Bangladesh-Afgh­a­nistan Chamber of Commerce, told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; that the visit also sought to exp­and commercial ties between the two nations. The interim government has not officially commented on the diplomatic exchange. However, a foreign ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described Noor’s trip as “personal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visit occurs as Bangladesh prepares for its first election since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following her ouster, groups previously sidelined or banned are seeking a return to formal politics. This includes Jamaat-i-Islami, the country’s largest and best-organised religious party, which is ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical precedents of cooperation exist between militants in the two countries; the Taliban had longstanding links with the banned militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami Ban­gl­adesh, with some members of the latter having fought in Afghanistan against Soviet forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reciprocal visits have also incre­ased recently. Leaders of Hefazat-i-Islam, an influential coalition of Isla­mic schools and Muslim organisations, visited Afghanistan in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon their return, they told the Dh­a­ka-based &lt;em&gt;Prothom Alo&lt;/em&gt; newspaper that they appreciated the “rule-based society” they observed under the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, whose archrivalry with &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-hasina-verdict-yunus-security-c1eec828e68460bae66824601a94eaca&quot;&gt;another former premier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defined the country’s politics for a generation, has died, her Bangladesh Nationalist Party said in a statement Tuesday. She was 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia was the first woman elected prime minister of Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had faced corruption cases she said were politically motivated, but in January 2025, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-zia-acquittal-corruption-hasina-supreme-court-bbbbcd38e67a013815b72cc49d45f1c9&quot;&gt;the Supreme Court acquitted Zia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the last corruption case against her, which would have let her run in &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-anniversary-hasina-yunus-uprising-4582f6ae05aac5f50e6922d0c2e778a2&quot;&gt;February’s general election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BNP said that after she was released from prison due to illness in 2020, her family requested the administration of her archrival, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, at least 18 times to allow her to be treated abroad, but the requests were rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-yunus-hasina-zia-politics-uprising-jamaat-f68cacfad0cfd31e33cccb497a564228&quot;&gt;Hasina’s ouster in 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, an interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus finally allowed her to go. She went to London in January and returned to Bangladesh in May. &lt;/p&gt;


    
        




    


&lt;h2&gt;Zia’s fight against the military dictatorship&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-history-photo-gallery-73c4087662ed0e43b91e74429213339e&quot;&gt;early years of independence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, gained in a bloody 1971 war against Pakistan, were marked by assassinations, coups and countercoups as military figures and secular and Islamic leaders jockeyed for power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia’s husband, President Ziaur Rahman, had grabbed power as a military chief in 1977 and a year later formed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. He was credited with opening democracy in the country, but he was killed in a 1981 military coup. Zia’s uncompromising stance against the military dictatorship helped build a mass movement against it, culminating with the ousting of dictator and former army chief H.M. Ershad in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    





&lt;p&gt;



    &lt;p&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;

            
        
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s opponent when she won her first term in 1991 and in several elections after that was Hasina, the daughter of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was assassinated in a 1975 coup. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
        
            
                
    
    &lt;a id=&quot;html-embed-module-e30000&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


    
    &lt;p&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;

            
        
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Zia was criticized over an early 1996 election in which her party won 278 of the 300 parliamentary seats during a wide boycott by other leading parties including Hasina’s Awami League, which demanded an election-time caretaker government. Zia’s government lasted only 12 days before a nonpartisan caretaker government was installed and the new election was held that June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia returned to power in 2001 in a government shared with the country’s main Islamist party, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-islamist-hasina-yunus-7bcf60910c94bef1730d0c8d62f22883&quot;&gt;Jamaat-e-Islami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which had a dark past involving Bangladesh’s independence war. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;Rivalry with Hasina&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party was previously closely allied with the party, and her government maintained the confidence of the business community by following pro-investment, open market policies. Zia was known to have a soft spot for Pakistan and used to deliver anti-Indian political speeches. India alleged insurgents were allowed to use Bangladesh’s soil to destabilize India’s northeastern states under Zia, especially during her second term from 2001-2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that term, Zia was also tainted by allegations that her elder son, Tarique Rahman, was running a parallel government and was involved in widespread corruption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, Hasina blamed Zia’s government and Rahman &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/general-news-15cc06be5bae433a94b5054d8691ad01&quot;&gt;for grenade attacks in Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that killed 24 members of her Awami League party and wounded hundreds of people. Hasina narrowly escaped the attack, which she characterized as an assassination attempt, and subsequently won the 2008 general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia’s party and its partners boycotted the 2014 election in a dispute over a caretaker government, giving a one-sided victory to the increasingly authoritarian regime of Hasina. Her party joined the national elections in 2018 but boycotted again in 2024, allowing Hasina to return to power for a fourth consecutive time &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/sheikh-hasina-awami-league-boycott-opposition-bangladesh-election-1506563c63b06166f800e8e89332b4e3&quot;&gt;through controversial elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia was sentenced to 17 years in jail &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/general-news-272d601763d34acd98a081f9ddf7375c&quot;&gt;in two separate corruption cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for misuse of power in embezzling funds meant for a charity named after her late husband. Her party said the charges were politically motivated to weaken the opposition, but the Hasina government said it did not interfere and the case was a matter for the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hasina was bitterly criticized by both her opponents and independent critics for sending Zia to jail. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;Health concerns trump politics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia was released from jail by Hasina’s government in 2020 and was moved to a rented home, from where she regularly visited a private hospital. Her family repeatedly requested Hasina’s administration to allow Zia to travel abroad for medical treatment, but was refused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 15 years in power, Hasina was ousted in a mass uprising in August 2024 and fled the country. &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-zia-yunus-hasina-election-246a0a75ae2fcab2e03ddfb13c611491&quot;&gt;Zia was given permission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to travel abroad by an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia was silent about politics for years and did not attend political rallies, but she remained the BNP chairperson until her death. Rahman has been the party’s acting chair since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was last seen at an annual function of the Bangladesh military in Dhaka Cantonment on Nov. 21, when Yunus and other political leaders met her. She was in a wheelchair and appeared pale and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is survived by Rahman, her elder son and heir apparent in the political dynasty. Her younger son, Arafat, died in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, dies at 80 after prolonged illness</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087/bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-khaleda-zia-dies-at-80-after-prolonged-illness</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the &lt;em&gt;Fajr&lt;/em&gt; prayer,” the party said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bdbnp78/status/2005817539113161047&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in late November, she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958157&quot;&gt;rushed to hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus called for the nation to pray for Zia, calling her a “source of utmost inspiration for the nation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP’s media chief Moudud Alamgir Pavel also confirmed Zia’s death to &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned to Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, dies at 80</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087/bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-khaleda-zia-dies-at-80</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the &lt;em&gt;Fajr&lt;/em&gt; prayer,” the party said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in late November, she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958157&quot;&gt;rushed to hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus called for the nation to pray for Zia, calling her a “source of utmost inspiration for the nation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP’s media chief Moudud Alamgir Pavel also confirmed Zia’s death to &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned to Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh’s three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia, who hoped to lead her nation one last time after the election next year, died on Tuesday aged 80, her party said.
The government declared three days of state mourning, with her funeral to be held on Wednesday.
Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in the election set for February – the first vote since a mass uprising toppled her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.

      <title>Bangladesh’s Gen-Z party faces revolt over religious alliance, risking its future</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963946/bangladeshs-gen-z-party-faces-revolt-over-religious-alliance-risking-its-future</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Bangladeshi youth-driven party born out of the country’s 2024 uprising is facing an open revolt from within after sealing an election alliance with a religio-political group, a move analysts say could jeopardise its future and reinforce established parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 30 senior leaders of the National Citizen Party (NCP) have openly opposed its alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, announced on Sunday, with several resigning in protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Muslim-majority South Asian nation goes to the polls on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1960599&quot;&gt;February 12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the deal, opinion polls had predicted Jamaat finishing a close second behind the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, while the NCP lagged far behind in third place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The NCP presented itself as a youth-driven alternative to traditional power structures. That identity is now under serious strain,” said H.M. Nazmul Alam, an academic. “Youth-based movements do not collapse only because they lose elections. They collapse when they lose clarity and internal unity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#alliance-for-greater-unity&quot; id=&quot;alliance-for-greater-unity&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Alliance for greater unity’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCP was formed earlier this year by leaders of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1846440&quot;&gt;protests &lt;/a&gt;that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief&quot;&gt;ousted &lt;/a&gt;long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, forcing her to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief#:~:text=Hasina%20flees%20to%20India&quot;&gt;flee &lt;/a&gt;to India. Driven by Gen-Z activists born after the late 1990s, it says it aims to free the nation from decades of nepotism and the dominance of Hasina’s Awami League and the BNP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Awami League banned, the vote will be effectively a direct contest between the BNP and Jamaat, which has trailed the other two in the past and had not been allowed to contest any elections since 2013 after a court said its registration as a political party conflicted with Bangladesh’s secular constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1855267&quot;&gt;revoked &lt;/a&gt;all the restrictions on Jamaat in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCP’s struggle shows the challenges of turning street power into votes and holds lessons for neighbouring Nepal, where similar youth-led protests ousted the government this year and fresh elections are due in March, political analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCP chief Nahid Islam told a press conference late on Sunday that the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928&quot;&gt;killing &lt;/a&gt;of 32-year-old Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the uprising, forced his party to seek an alliance to keep at bay forces trying to derail the election through violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The dictatorship we overthrew is attempting to sabotage the election. Therefore, for the sake of greater unity, we have reached an electoral understanding with Jamaat, said Nahid, 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was a majority decision within the party, but some may be opposed to it and they are free to take their own decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier in December while launching his election campaign as an independent candidate. Police say they have identified the killers but have not apprehended them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#your-centrist-idea-and-ideology-will-vanish&quot; id=&quot;your-centrist-idea-and-ideology-will-vanish&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Your centrist idea and ideology will vanish’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nahid earlier told Reuters his organisation was weak because it had not had enough time to build itself. It was also hampered by scarce funds and an unclear stance on key issues such as rights for women and minorities, Reuters reported in early December, citing party leaders who said alliance talks had been underway for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One senior NCP leader to have resigned is Tasnim Jara, a doctor who left a career in Britain to join the party. She is now seeking the support of nearly 5,000 voters to be allowed to contest as an independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I promised you and the people of this country that I would fight for you and for building a new political culture,” she said on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whatever the circumstances, I am determined to keep that promise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political analyst Asif Shahan, a professor at the University of Dhaka, said the NCP was “doomed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you go with Jamaat, it will help Jamaat, not you,” he said. “It will give them a liberal cover, and in return, you will become a force for the right. Your centrist idea and ideology - already poorly defined - will simply vanish.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh’s youth-driven National Citizen Party (NCP) is facing internal revolt after forming an election alliance with Islamist group Jamaat-e-Islami, a move that has sparked resignations and could undermine its credibility ahead of February 12 polls. At least 30 senior leaders openly opposed the decision, warning it risks eroding the party’s Gen-Z identity and core principles. [&amp;#8230;]</description>

                &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-subhead&quot;&gt;The ECHR asked the UK to justify stripping Shamima Begum of citizenship amid concerns that she was groomed and trafficked into Syria&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-main-image&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-cutline&quot;&gt;Begum fled her East London home at the age of 15 to join the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria with two school friends (AFP) &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-wide-photo-video&quot;&gt;Off&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has called on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; government to explain its decision to strip a British woman of her citizenship after she fled to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/syria&quot;&gt;Syria &lt;/a&gt;as a 15-year-old to join the Islamic State (IS) group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late December, the Strasbourg court sent a series of questions to the British government, asking whether it broke anti-trafficking obligations when it stripped &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-supreme-court-refuse-hear-shamima-begum-appeal&quot;&gt;Shamima Begum&lt;/a&gt; of her citizenship in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions include whether the government violated Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits slavery, servitude, forced labour, and a state’s duty to prevent and investigate trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped Begum of her citizenship on national security grounds after his office said that the deprivation was “conducive to the public good” and that not doing so posed a threat to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javid also justified the decision to strip her British citizenship on the grounds that she qualified for a Bangladeshi passport through her parents’ heritage, despite never visiting or living in the South Asian country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begum made headlines when she fled to Syria in 2015 to join IS with two school friends from her East London home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She reappeared four years later after journalists tracked her down in IS territory. At the time, she was&amp;nbsp;heavily pregnant with a child who later passed away,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Begum has tried and failed multiple times, to return to the UK and restore her citizenship in a series of legal battles with the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of those attempts have been successful and she continues to be held in a prison camp in northern Syria controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECHR is also assessing whether the Home Office failed to take into account whether she was a victim of trafficking, and if removing her citizenship could have stopped the government’s duty to investigate how she was allowed to leave the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Catalogue of failures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her application to the Strasbourg court, Begum’s lawyers said that the UK authorities failed to ask four questions before depriving her of her citizenship, namely: whether she had been trafficked to Syria, whether British authorities failed to protect her, and whether her deprivation of citizenship would undermine any future investigation into potential trafficking, and if trafficking issues were present, whether deprivation could be justified on national-security grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birnberg Peirce Solicitors, which represents Begum, described the ECHR’s intervention as an “unprecedented opportunity” for the UK government to assess whether previous administrations ignored or sidestepped any considerations made to strip her of her citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Strasbourg’s communication presents an unprecedented opportunity for the UK as well as for Ms Begum - to grapple with the significant considerations raised in her case and ignored, sidestepped or violated up to now by previous UK administrations,” said Gareth Peirce, the lawyer representing Begum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is impossible to dispute that a 15-year-old British child was in 2014-15 lured, encouraged, and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to ISIL-controlled territory for the known purpose of being given, as a child, to an ISIL fighter to propagate children for the Islamic State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The police failed to warn families, informed the school that its apprehension of risk was overstated, conducted no safeguarding measures, delayed contact with ports and known routes of travel to trigger alarms and prevent [them] reaching the known destination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Home Office did not respond to Middle East Eye’s request for comment at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Declan Morgan, the former lord chief justice of Ireland, said Britain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/former-northern-irish-lord-chief-justice-says-uk-wrong-strip-shamima-begum-citizenship&quot;&gt;should not have stripped&lt;/a&gt; Begum of her British citizenship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan, who serves as a a supplementary panel member of the UK Supreme Court, made the remarks&amp;nbsp; at the launch of a new&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/sweeping-uk-terror-law-label-harmful-behaviour-terrorism-prevent-overhaul&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by the Independent Commission on UK Counter-Terrorism Law, Policy and Practice, which he chairs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Special Immigration Appeals Court found that the conditions in the prison camp where Begum is being arbitrarily detained without trial constituted inhuman and degrading treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years later, SIAC also found that the state failed to protect her but noted that its “hands were tied” as a result of the Supreme Court’s limiting the immigration court’s ability to take into consideration the merits of Begum’s case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECHR’s intervention comes as activists ramp up their campaigning against the UK’s growing use of citizenship-stripping powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final judgement is expected at a later date, following submissions from the UK government and Begum’s lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Karachi-Dhaka flights likely from January, says Pakistan’s high commissioner</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963937/karachi-dhaka-flights-likely-from-january-says-pakistans-high-commissioner</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider expressed hope on Monday that direct flights between Karachi and Dhaka will start in January, during a meeting with the Chief Advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during Sheikh Hasina’s rule. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, relations between the two countries improved markedly, with Professor Muhammad Yunus leading the interim administration in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChiefAdviserGoB/status/2005281898424381710&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the meeting, both sides discussed ways to expand cooperation in trade, investment, and aviation, as well as scaling up cultural, educational, and medical exchanges to further strengthen bilateral relations between the two South Asian nations,” said a statement shared on X by Bangladesh’s interim leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haider, during the meeting, also noted that bilateral trade has recorded a 20 per cent growth compared to last year, with business communities from both countries actively exploring new investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high commissioner further highlighted a “significant increase” in cultural exchanges, adding that “Bangladeshi students have shown strong interest in higher education opportunities in Pakistan, particularly in medical sciences, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan has witnessed a rise in patients travelling to its leading hospitals for liver and kidney transplants,” said Islamabad’s envoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, the high commissioner also stated that Pakistan was ready to offer “training and academic opportunities in transplantation-related medical fields”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that Bangladesh’s interim leader welcomed the “growing interactions between the two countries” and emphasised the “importance of increased visits, as well as cultural, educational, and people-to-people exchanges among SAARC member states.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Professor Yunus also underscored the need to further boost Bangladesh–Pakistan trade,” added the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus also expressed hope that during the current high commissioner’s tenure, both countries would “explore new avenues for investment and joint venture businesses“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1936871/fm-dar-meets-bangladeshs-yunus-during-historic-visit-as-revitalising-saarc-comes-under-focus&quot;&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; with Professor Yunus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1935344&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;landmark visit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Dhaka, both countries stressed the need to revitalise regional cooperation through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Office (FO) termed Dar’s two-day visit — the first by a Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh in 13 years — a “significant milestone” in the two countries’ relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paki­stan and Bangladesh had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1926083&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;agreed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side a month before, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The recent homecoming of Tarique Rahman, the de facto leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and heir to one of the country’s most powerful political families, is widely expected to reshape the political trajectory ahead of February’s national election.
Analysts say his return after 17 years in exile could consolidate the BNP’s position as the dominant electoral force, while tempering a volatile political climate unsettled by unrest and tensions with India following the overthrow of...</description>

                                        &lt;p&gt;GENEVA (AP) — The United States on Monday announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to slash U.S. foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies to “adapt, shrink or die” in a time of new financial realities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The money is a small fraction of what the U.S. has contributed in the past but reflects what the administration believes is a generous amount that will maintain the United States’ status as the world’s largest humanitarian donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pledge creates an umbrella fund from which money will be doled out to individual agencies and priorities, a key part of U.S. demands for drastic changes across the world body that have alarmed many humanitarian workers and led to severe reductions in programs and services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $2 billion is only a sliver of traditional U.S. humanitarian funding for U.N.-backed programs, which has run as high as $17 billion annually in recent years, according to U.N. data. U.S. officials say only $8-$10 billion of that has been in voluntary contributions. The United States also pays billions in annual dues related to its U.N. membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say the Western aid cutbacks have been shortsighted, driven &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/world-food-program-hunger-trump-afghanistan-congo-somalia-sudan-3271c01a60128ae54e4ff4867b904826&quot;&gt;millions toward hunger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, displacement or disease, and harmed &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-china-foreign-aid-global-influence-d7f3ac76dcbf7c9b75e7b147d8d8fcb6&quot;&gt;U.S. soft power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
        
            
                
    
    &lt;a id=&quot;html-embed-module-e30000&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


    
    &lt;p&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;

            
        
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;A year of crisis in aid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move caps a crisis year for many U.N. organizations like its refugee, migration and food aid agencies. The Trump administration has &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/unhcr-trump-iom-ocha-unaids-world-health-organization-d5372e0193c720b55b88db7dcd1c7f0a&quot;&gt;already cut billions in U.S. foreign aid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, prompting them to slash spending, aid projects and thousands of jobs. Other traditional Western donors have reduced outlays, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announced U.S. pledge for aid programs of the United Nations — the world’s top provider of humanitarian assistance and biggest recipient of U.S. humanitarian aid money — takes shape in a preliminary deal with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, run by Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat and government official. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;Even as the U.S. pulls back its aid, needs have ballooned across the world: Famine has been recorded this year in parts of conflict-ridden &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/sudan-famine-darfur-ipc-elfasher-e4816f40ac2b2852b0b70c85e8f741d1&quot;&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/gaza-famine-hunger-israel-ceasefire-a5f88e20db2a5c4f754117de9bdada69&quot;&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and floods, drought and natural disasters that many scientists attribute to climate change have taken many lives or driven thousands from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts will have major implications for U.N. affiliates like the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/iom-migration-us-aid-cuts-humanitarian-migrants-61cdf8c96a0a26211a2c8cd5042a44d1&quot;&gt;International Organization for Migration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the World Food Program and refugee agency UNHCR. They have already received billions less from the U.S. this year than under annual allocations from the previous Biden administration — or even during Trump’s first term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the idea is that Fletcher’s office — which last year set in motion a “humanitarian reset” to improve efficiency, accountability and effectiveness of money spent — will become a funnel for U.S. and other aid money that can be then redirected to those agencies, rather than scattered U.S. contributions to a variety of individual appeals for aid. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;US seeks aid consolidation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States wants to see “more consolidated leadership authority” in U.N. aid delivery systems, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide details before the announcement at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the plan, Fletcher and his coordination office “are going to control the spigot” on how money is distributed to agencies, the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This humanitarian reset at the United Nations should deliver more aid with fewer tax dollars — providing more focused, results-driven assistance aligned with U.S foreign policy,” said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Michael Waltz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials say the $2 billion is just a first outlay to help fund OCHA’s annual appeal for money, announced earlier this month. Fletcher, noting the upended aid landscape, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/un-switzerland-humanitarian-aid-ocha-funding-e764d76f3a5adcd861899a3b0be66ab3&quot;&gt;already slashed the request this year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Other traditional U.N. donors like Britain, France, Germany and Japan have reduced aid allocations and sought reforms this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The agreement requires the U.N. to consolidate humanitarian functions to reduce bureaucratic overhead, unnecessary duplication, and ideological creep,” the State Department said in a statement. “Individual U.N. agencies will need to adapt, shrink, or die.” &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;“Nowhere is reform more important than the humanitarian agencies, which perform some of the U.N.’s most critical work,” the department added. “Today’s agreement is a critical step in those reform efforts, balancing President Trump’s commitment to remaining the world’s most generous nation, with the imperative to bring reform to the way we fund, oversee, and integrate with U.N. humanitarian efforts.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core, the reform project will help establish pools of funding that can be directed either to specific crises or countries in need. A total of 17 countries will be targeted initially, including Bangladesh, Congo, Haiti, Syria and Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;One of the world’s most desperate countries, Afghanistan, is not included, nor are the Palestinian territories, which officials say will be covered by money stemming from Trump’s as-yet-incomplete Gaza peace plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, months in the making, stems from Trump’s longtime view that the world body has great promise, but has failed to live up to it, and has — in his eyes — drifted too far from its original mandate to save lives while undermining American interests, promoting radical ideologies and encouraging wasteful, unaccountable spending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher praised the deal, saying in a statement, “At a moment of immense global strain, the United States is demonstrating that it is a humanitarian superpower, offering hope to people who have lost everything.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee reported from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh’s National Citizen Party: ‘new hope’ that looks like the old guard</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963842/bangladeshs-national-citizen-party-new-hope-that-looks-like-the-old-guard</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE National Citizen Party (NCP) was born with a claim that it would not practise politics as usual. Emerging from the July uprising, it asked people to see it as a break from Bangladesh’s old habits of convenience and compromise. It promised to distinguish itself with its own political language and its own sense of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two developments have turned speculation into a moment of reckoning. Tasnim Jara, a senior and one of the more visible leaders, in her own right, resigned from the party. She announced she would contest the Dhaka-9 constituency as an independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, 30 members of the party’s central committee have formally written to Convener Nahid Islam, opposing any political alliance or seat-sharing arrangement with Jamaat-i-Islami. It has now become a question of credibility for the NCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seat-sharing is not unusual in Bangladesh. Elections are fought one constituency at a time and depend on organisation, polling agents and the ability to protect votes. New parties struggle because these structures take years to build. Seat sharing arrangements or alliance might make sense for electoral politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the NCP did not enter politics asking to be judged by that standard alone. From the outset, it framed itself as the political expression of a movement that rejected the logic of a deal that “works”. Its leaders, shaped by the July uprising, spoke against shortcuts, against recycling old alignments, and against moral ambiguity. They spoke of a new arrangement, ‘Naya Bondobosto’ as they kept harping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That positioning mattered. It is why many young people, first-time participants and politically unaffiliated citizens placed their trust in the party. What has changed since then? If the NCP has reassessed its strength and concluded that contesting independently is not viable in this election cycle, it should say so plainly. Admitting organisational limits would not weaken the party. It would demonstrate seriousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any understanding with Jamaat-i-Islami also carries a weight far beyond seat numbers. Jamaat’s opposition to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1704822&quot;&gt;independence in 1971&lt;/a&gt; and its role during the Liberation War are not fringe allegations. They are part of Bangladesh’s mainstream political history. That history has shaped alliances, exclusions and public trust for decades. It cannot be set aside through electoral arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasnim Jara’s decision brings this tension into sharp focus. In announcing her independent candidacy on Facebook, she openly acknowledged the disadvantages of running without party infrastructure, an organised worker base, or institutional access to security and administration. Yet she chose that path, citing her commitment to a new political culture and the promise she had made to voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central committee letter makes the issue impossible to dismiss as personal dissent. The 30 signatories invoke the NCP’s declared ideology, the historical responsibility of the July uprising and democratic ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They explicitly cite Jamaat’s political history, particularly its role in 1971, as incompatible with the party’s values. They also warn of immediate consequences, saying that even reports of a possible alliance have already led supporters and organisers to reconsider their backing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money adds another layer of accountability. The NCP presented itself as a citizen-funded alternative to patronage politics. Crowdfunding is not merely a financial tool. It is a political contract. Many of those contributors are uncomfortable with Jamaat’s history and politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the party now moves in a direction that contradicts the assumptions under which that money was raised, the cost will extend beyond this election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warnings have also come from within the wider July movement. Abdul Kader, a former coordinator associated with the uprising, has cautioned publicly that an NCP–Jamaat understanding risks damaging the future of youth politics. That concern reflects a fear that a rare moment of political clarity is being traded for short-term opportunism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the NCP believes reform is impossible without parliamentary seats, it should say so. If it believes contesting independently is not viable this time, it should explain why. If it believes seat-sharing with Jamaat does not dilute its core commitments, it must articulate those commitments clearly and draw its red lines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Student leader’s killing continues to drive Bangladesh unrest</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963867/student-leaders-killing-continues-to-drive-bangladesh-unrest</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Inqilab Moncho-led demos held across key highways in Dhaka, other major cities&lt;br /&gt;• Official says charge sheet to be filed within 10 days&lt;br /&gt;• Suspects ‘fled to India’: police&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Inqilab Moncho and allied groups staged simultaneous blockades across major highways and intersections in various cities across Bangladesh on Sunday, demanding justice for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962210&quot;&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; of student leader Sharif Osman Hadi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi, a vocal critic of India who took part in last year’s mass uprising, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961387&quot;&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier this month and later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities hit by the protests included Dhaka, Chattogram, Rajshahi, Gazipur, Barishal, Cumilla and Khulna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders and activists of Inqilab Moncho blocked the Shahbagh intersection in Dhaka for the third consecutive day on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Statements from the administration are nothing but eyewash. They are simply trying to waste time. The perpetrators could have been arrested on the very day the shooting happened,” said Naim Islam, a central member of Inqilab Moncho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government must disclose to the public who is pressuring whom. They claim some people have been arrested, but the real killer must be brought to justice,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The interim government is determined to ensure justice for the [Hadi’s] killing,” he said, adding that police, Border Guard Bangladesh, Rapid Action Battalion, and intelligence agencies were working closely and in coordination to uncover the facts behind the murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure has been mounting on Bangladesh’s interim government to arrest the killers of Hadi, who was set to contest the general elections in February next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s home adviser, retired Lt Gen Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, said investigators were expected to submit the charge sheet in the popular student leader’s murder case within 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said authorities had made significant progress, but not everything could be disclosed at the moment to protect the integrity of the investigation and to identify both the perpetrators and those who backed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said 11 people have so far been arrested in the case, including the wife and parents of the alleged mastermind, Faisal Karim Masud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the arrestees, six gave confessional statements under Section 164, while four witnesses also gave statements under the same provision, the adviser said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on information from the arrestees, witness statements, reviews of recovered evidence and an overall assessment, the investigation is now in its final stage, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I request everyone to remain patient,” he said, adding that a decision had already been made to transfer the case to a speedy trial tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to assure you that the trial in the Hadi murder case will be completed within the tenure of the current interim government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Fled to India’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; quoted Bangladesh police as saying that Hadi’s suspected killers had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963734&quot;&gt;fled&lt;/a&gt; to India, in comments likely to further strain relations with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The killing was premeditated. Those behind it have been identified,” Nazrul Islam, a senior Dhaka Metropolitan Police officer, said at a news conference He added that the suspects left Bangladesh through the Haluaghat border on Dec 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were received at the border by two Indian citizens, who escorted them into the northeastern state of Meghalaya before handing them over to two accomplices.” Bangladeshi investigators were in contact with their Indian counterparts, who had arrested the two suspected accomplices, Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PTI will use protests to push govt for talks: Afridi</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963862/pti-will-use-protests-to-push-govt-for-talks-afridi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• KP CM says dialogue without ‘resistance’ not effective; Karachi his ‘next destination’&lt;br /&gt;• Believes talks can be meaningful if ‘power-wielding individuals’ participate&lt;br /&gt;• Azma claims ‘street movement’ failed to attract public, dubs it ‘social media hype’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: After spending three days in the provincial capital &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963371&quot;&gt;galvanising&lt;/a&gt; party supporters, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Min­ister Sohail Afridi said the PTI would not engage in talks with the government without first taking to the streets to demonstrate its opposition to the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His remarks come as party leaders are split into two camps: one led by veterans favouring dialogue, while the other is bent on street agitation as per the directions of the incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day earlier, CM Afridi said the decision to initiate talks rested with the opposition alliance, and that he was in charge of the ‘street movement’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CM Afridi, along with other provincial ministers and members of the assembly, had arrived in Lahore to launch a new street movement, as per the directives of Imran Khan. He left the provincial capital in the evening. Before Afridi, his predecessor, Ali Amin Gandapur, also came to Lahore earlier this year, ostensibly to launch a protest drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Mr Afridi told journalists at a meeting that reconciliation was impossible without resistance. “We will be at a loss if we enter into dialogue without resistance. So, the protest movement will continue until the rulers come to the table after recognising the opposition as an equal partner,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to a question whether the party had perpetually been protesting without any result, CM Afridi said, “This time, we will not make tall claims but do practical work and come up with a positive output.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing his thoughts about the dialogue &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962792/if-they-are-ready-govt-is-definitely-ready-pm-shehbaz-reiterates-offer-for-dialogue-with-opposition&quot;&gt;offered&lt;/a&gt; by the government, the CM claimed there must have been some ‘direction’ from the powers that be to the PM that he offered talks. He said talks could be meaningful only after inclusion of individuals who wielded power and influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We could not develop a working relationship with the establishment because they did not accept my policy and I could not accept their policy,” he said in response to a question about him reaching out to the powerful quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The establishment now knows that the incumbent rulers were unable to take Pakistan forward,” he said, while accusing the ruling parties of corruption and economic mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Afridi said it was not necessary that the PTI pick D-Chowk in Islamabad as its protest site, as it did in November last year, adding that it was also not important to end the protest after a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an X post, the CM also announced his intention of visiting Karachi for the ‘street movement’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SohailAfridiISF/status/2005299736509837401&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, meanwhile, said no political party could go into a blind alley. “We are seeing that the government wants the PTI to neither speak about its election fraud, the release of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, nor question institutions’ interference in politics and journalism. Then what should we do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Raja said reconciliation and dialogue could only begin when the “basic principles” would be agreed — otherwise the party would take to the streets to get these principles accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting with journalists, CM Afridi was stopped from entering the Lahore cantonment area, where he had plans to meet the families of incarcerated former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and advocate Hassaan Niazi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KP CM said he had been stopped as they had made (cantonement) a no-go area. “I have asked whether Pakistan’s territory ended here and another country’s land started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Punjab government should not have behaved in such a harsh manner with the chief minister of a province. This has all been happening with me for the past three consecutive days,” he lamented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The KP CM is also ready to go without his gunmen and KP police, but is still not being allowed,” Salman Akram Raja said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azma ridicules PTI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari ridiculed the PTI’s street movement, saying its reality was “exposed in daylight after social media hype overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement on X, Ms Bokhari quipped that PTI supporters were celebrating by sharing images of Bangladesh since last night, claiming that the so-called street movement failed to attract any public response during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AzmaBokhariPMLN/status/2005233578763038959&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said there was no one even to respond to the slogans raised by the protesters. Taking a jibe at the demonstrators, she said they had “toured the ‘Europe of Pakistan,’ Lahore, enough under heavy protocol” and should now return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please, let Lahore breathe in peace,” she said, adding that PTI leaders should go back and address the issues of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead. She urged PTI to focus on public welfare in its own province rather than staging what she termed ineffective protests elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amjad Mahmood also contributed to this report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A proposed electoral alliance between Bangladesh&apos;s National Citizen Party and Jamaat-e-Islami is causing divisions. Thirty NCP leaders have protested, citing Jamaat&apos;s controversial past including its role in the 1971 Liberation War. This move comes as seat-sharing talks near completion. Some NCP leaders previously belonged to Jamaat&apos;s student wing. Jamaat sought partnership with NCP over the BNP.</description>

      <title>Party would move towards dialogue after ensuring level-playing field provided through street movement: PTI</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963737/party-would-move-towards-dialogue-after-ensuring-level-playing-field-provided-through-street-movement-pti</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The PTI on Sunday denied opting to engage in dialogue with the government as an underdog but said that it will do so “after ensuring a level-playing field is provided to it through street movements“, according to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and the PTI Secretary-General, Salman Akram Raja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CM Afridi, along with other provincial ministers and members of the assembly, was in Lahore to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963371&quot;&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; a new street movement, as per the directives of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan. He left for the motorway at about 6:40pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a discussion with senior journalists at a private residence in Lahore’s Defence Housing Authority earlier in the day, Afridi asserted that reconciliation was impossible without resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will be at a loss if we enter into dialogue without resistance. So, the protest movement will continue until the rulers come to the table after recognising the opposition as an equal partner,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to a question whether the party had perpetually been protesting without yielding any result, CM Afridi said, “This time, we will not make tall claims but do practical work and come up with a positive output.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary-General Raja said no political party could go into a blind alley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing that the government want the PTI to neither speak about its election fraud, the release of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, nor question institutions’ interference in politics and journalism. Then what should we do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raja said reconciliation and dialogue could only begin when the “basic principles” would be agreed – otherwise the party would take to the streets to get these principles accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting with journalists, CM Afridi visited the residences of party leaders Mirza Afridi, but was stopped from entering the Lahore cantonment area, where he had plans to meet the families of incarcerated former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and advocate Hassan Niazi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KP CM said he had been stopped as they had made (cantonement) a no-go area. “I have asked whether Pakistan’s territory ended here and another country’s land started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Punjab government should not have behaved in such a harsh manner with the chief minister of a province. This has all been happening with me for the past three consecutive days,” he lamented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have been asking to go to the party leaders’ residences in the cantonment but was told that I was not permitted,” he said and demanded that he be given a reason “in writing” as to why he was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The KP CM is also ready to go without his gunmen and KP police, but is still not being allowed,” Salman Akram Raja said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962792/if-they-are-ready-govt-is-definitely-ready-pm-shehbaz-reiterates-offer-for-dialogue-with-opposition&quot;&gt;offered&lt;/a&gt; talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#street-movement-failed-to-attract-public-azma&quot; id=&quot;street-movement-failed-to-attract-public-azma&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Street movement failed to attract public’: Azma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister, Azma Bokhari, ridiculed the PTI’s street movement, saying its reality was “exposed in daylight after social media hype overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a statement on X, Bokhari remarked that PTI supporters were celebrating by sharing images of Bangladesh since last night, claiming that the so-called street movement failed to attract any public response during the day.&lt;br /&gt;She said there was no one even to respond to the slogans raised by the protesters. Taking a jibe at the demonstrators, Bokhari said they had “toured the ‘Europe of Pakistan,’ Lahore, enough under heavy protocol” and should now return.&lt;br /&gt;“Please, let Lahore breathe in peace,” she said, adding that PTI leaders should go back and address the issues of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead.&lt;br /&gt;She urged PTI to focus on public welfare in its own province rather than staging what she termed ineffective protests elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sikh activists clash with Hindu protesters outside Bangladeshi High Commission in London</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963739/sikh-activists-clash-with-hindu-protesters-outside-bangladeshi-high-commission-in-london</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LONDON: A demonstration outside the Bangladeshi High Commission in London on Saturday briefly turned tense when pro-Khalistan Sikh activists and a small group of Hindu protesters confronted each other, prompting police intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Khalistan Movement wants an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1776744#:~:text=wants%20an%20independent%20Sikh%20state%20carved%20out%20of%20India%20and%20dates%20back%20to%20India%20and%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20independence%20in%201947%20when%20the%20idea%20was%20pushed%20forward%20in%20negotiations%20preceding%20the%20partition%20of%20the%20Punjab%20region%20between%20the%20two%20new%20countries.&quot;&gt;independent Sikh state&lt;/a&gt; carved out of India and dates back to India and Pakistan’s independence in 1947, when the idea was pushed forward in negotiations preceding the partition of the Punjab region between the two new countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protest was held in connection with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808#:~:text=lynching%20of%20a%20Hindu%20man%20over%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy.&quot;&gt;reports of violence&lt;/a&gt; against Hindus in Bangladesh. During the gathering, Paramjeet Singh Pamma, identified by organisers as a coordinator of the Khalistan Referendum campaign, was involved in a brief scuffle with an Indian Hindu protester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metropolitan Police officers on duty intervened quickly, separating the individuals and dispersing the groups from close proximity to the mission building. No injuries were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SFJ_US_Official/status/2004947498058531220&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the incident, pro-Khalistan Sikh protesters formed a cordon near the embassy entrance and continued their demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They raised political slogans, accusing the Indian government of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1918029&quot;&gt;involvement&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1831329&quot;&gt;killings &lt;/a&gt;of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and others. Police maintained a presence to prevent further confrontation and said the situation was brought under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has designated Pamma as a “most wanted terrorist” — a charge he and his supporters reject. He currently resides in the United Kingdom. UK authorities have not announced any charges against him, and previous Indian requests related to his extradition have not resulted in court action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan Police did not issue any immediate statement on arrests or further action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nijjar was &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/advocate-separate-sikh-state-india-shot-dead-canada-hardeep-singh-nijjar-temple&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;shot dead&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 45 by masked gunmen outside the temple he presided over after being wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism offences and conspiracy to commit murder — accusations he denied. His murder in June 2023 near his home in Vancouver sparked a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1865190&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;diplomatic storm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between India and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in November 2023, US authorities &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1791573&quot;&gt;thwarted &lt;/a&gt;a plot to kill Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the United States and issued a warning to India over concerns the government in New Delhi was involved, the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times (FT)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/56f7d6d6-6a93-4172-a49e-d8a91991e29d&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, an Indian intelligence official and an Indian national &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1866009&quot;&gt;indicted &lt;/a&gt;for their role in the plot to kill Pannun, according to the US Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in March this year, India asked the US to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1898726&quot;&gt;list &lt;/a&gt;Sikhs For Justice, a separatist group, as a terrorist organisation — a point that came up during talks between Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and visiting US national intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For now, Rahman’s return is a consequential fact: it reshapes domestic dynamics and reframes the bilateral conversation at a critical moment in Bangladesh’s political calendar.

      <title>Bangladesh police say student leader’s killers fled to India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963734/bangladesh-police-say-student-leaders-killers-fled-to-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh police on Sunday said the alleged killers of popular student leader&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962252&quot;&gt; Sharif Osman Hadi&lt;/a&gt; had fled to India, in comments likely to further strain relations with its neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi, a vocal India critic who took part in last year’s mass uprising, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961387&quot;&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier this month and later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928/wounded-leader-of-bangladesh-uprising-dies-in-singapore-hospital&quot;&gt;succumbed &lt;/a&gt;to his injuries at a hospital in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His death set off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962210&quot;&gt;violent protests &lt;/a&gt;with angry mobs torching several buildings, including two major newspapers deemed to favour India, as well as a prominent cultural institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With protests being held across the country almost daily, pressure has been growing on Bangladesh’s interim government to arrest the killers of Hadi, who was set to contest the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1928869&quot;&gt;general elections&lt;/a&gt; in February next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The killing was premeditated. Those behind it have been identified,” Nazrul Islam, a senior Dhaka Metropolitan Police officer, said at a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the suspects left Bangladesh through the Haluaghat border with India shortly after attacking Hadi on December 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were received at the border by two Indian citizens, who escorted them into the northeastern state of Meghalaya before handing them over to two accomplices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi investigators were in contact with their Indian counterparts, who had arrested the two suspected accomplices, Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are communicating with Meghalaya police, who have confirmed the arrest of two Indian nationals,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two senior Meghalaya police officers, however, did not comment when contacted by &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian foreign ministry had earlier said it rejects “false narratives” about New Delhi’s involvement in Hadi’s killing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ties between the neighbours have deteriorated since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ousted &lt;/a&gt;prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled the pro-democracy uprising and sought refuge in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India says it is still considering Dhaka’s requests to extradite Hasina, who was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; in absentia for orchestrating a deadly crackdown on the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962420/massive-crowd-attends-funeral-of-bangladesh-student-leader#:~:text=the%20violence%20this%20week%20also%20saw%20a%20Hindu%20garment%20worker%20killed%20following%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy&quot;&gt;lynching &lt;/a&gt;of a Hindu garment worker by a mob on December 18 has also hit ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the deteriorating security situation in the Muslim-majority country, Khuda Baksh Chowdhury, special assistant to interim leader Muhammad Yunus, overseeing the home department, stepped down on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Growing Islamic Fundamentalism In Bangladesh: A Security Challenge For India</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/growing-islamic-fundamentalism-bangladesh-security-challenge-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yunus’s actions increasingly reflect the anti-India agenda of pro-Pakistan fundamentalists. This is illustrated by a book he recently presented to a visiting Canadian delegation - its cover featured a map of Bangladesh appearing to encompass large parts of India’s northeast—a symbolic gesture aimed at globalising the anti-India narrative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dar hails Pakistan’s success in May conflict with India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963562/dar-hails-pakistans-success-in-may-conflict-with-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday hailed Pakistan’s success over India during the military escalation between the two countries earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A strong message was sent to the world,” he said while speaking to the media in Islamabad, where he gave an overview of Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our international standing has […] improved due to principled, proactive and result-oriented diplomacy,” Dar said, reflecting on the past year. He said Pakistan was “known to be a diplomatically isolated country” at the time PM Shehbaz Sharif took oath last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the May conflict, Dar said India’s claim of regional hegemony and being the net security provider was tested during the four-day escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We did not ask anyone to mediate between us,” the deputy premier asserted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recalled that Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials&quot;&gt;shot down&lt;/a&gt; seven &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1947213#:~:text=Lt%20Gen%20Chaudhry%20was%20quoted%20as%20saying%20that%20Pakistan%20had%20recently%20raised%20its%20tally%20of%20Indian%20aircraft%20shot%20down%20to%20seven&quot;&gt;jets&lt;/a&gt; of India during the May 7 air battle, which was followed by “incorrect” statements by New Delhi that Pakistan had attacked 15 Indian military installations. He also hailed the armed forces’ technology for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390&quot;&gt;intercepting&lt;/a&gt; 79 out of 80 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909385&quot;&gt;drones&lt;/a&gt; sent by India to Pakistan in 36 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minister pointed out that Pakistan had remained “proactively engaged” after both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1536224&quot;&gt;Pulwama&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source&quot;&gt;Pahalgam&lt;/a&gt; incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This time, their mala fide intentions regarding the Indus waters. They have been corresponding with Pakistan for the last 1.5-2 years on climate change that ‘ground realities have changed’,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailing the May events, Dar said the civil-military leadership led by PM Shehbaz “authorised” certain decisions in a meeting on the night of May 9. He said India then “made the mistake” of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909893&quot;&gt;attacking&lt;/a&gt; the Nur Khan Airbase in the early hours of May 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The process which had been authorised by the PM had to be implemented,” Dar said, but India made the “super mistake”, which then led to Pakistan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186&quot;&gt;retaliatory operation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After April 22, we used to have long hours. From [May] 6 to 10, we used to be here at night too,” the minister said, adding that he conducted over 60 phone calls with foreign dignitaries before May 6 and after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about India’s claims of Islamabad attacking it, Dar said: “I told one of the P5 countries that this is a digital world, it cannot be hidden … they called me back after 16-17 hours and told me we had not attacked anywhere in India. This was a first serious setback for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailing his exchanges with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Dar said, “At around 8:17am, I received a call from Secretary Rubio of USA that ‘India is ready to ceasefire, are you willing?’ I said ’we never wanted to go to war’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Within 45 minutes, I received a call from Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal. ‘Brother, I understand that you have authorised Secretary Rubio. Am I permitted to talk to India’ […] Prince Faisal said I will talk to the foreign minister of India and get back,” Dar recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that within an hour, the Saudi minister called him back and said he had also confirmed the ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been established that Pakistan’s armed forces, its technology and its capacity for defence is very solid. We only did in self-defence according to what was done to us; otherwise, it could have been much greater than this too,” the deputy PM said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Allah made [Pakistan] a nuclear power and a missile power. What you need now is economic power,” he stressed, highlighting that the country possessed great natural resources, such as mines and minerals, gas, and hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Related to Pahalgam and other incidents, our main analysis shared with everyone is that till the time the Jammu and Kashmir issue is not resolved, […] perpetual and permanent peace cannot be established in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreign minister reiterated Pakistan’s protest against India’s actions in occupied Kashmir, including “demographic changes and amendments in the Constitution”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dar noted that the May episode had revived the Kashmir issue at the international level, with the United Nations Security Council also discussing agendas related to human rights violations in India-occupied Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Indus Waters Treaty, Dar said the FO had actively engaged with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deputy PM also highlighted that a “major ice-breaking breakthrough” occurred with Bangladesh as ties between the two nations revived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dar recalled that Hina Rabbani Khar had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/762773/bangladesh-seeks-pakistan-apology-for-1971-war-crimes&quot;&gt;visited Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, but there had been no engagement afterwards because of the “anti-Pakistan” government there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My 36-hour &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1935344&quot;&gt;visit to Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; was very engaging. I had meetings with the chief executive, the foreign minister and cabinet ministers and advisers,” he observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During my time there of 36 hours, I saw great gestures of goodwill for Pakistan,” Dar said, adding that Islamabad will proactively engage with Dhaka after the February polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan’s diplomacy during the crisis demonstrated our proactive approach and it showed our ability of transforming challenges into opportunities and our thought of effective narrative projection with principled engagement,” the minister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#positive-ties-with-us&quot; id=&quot;positive-ties-with-us&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Positive ties with US&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dar hailed the United States’ “proactive role” in the Pak-India ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is why on June 11, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514&quot;&gt;nominated&lt;/a&gt; [President Donald] Trump for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1947881&quot;&gt;Nobel Peace Prize 2026&lt;/a&gt;. The media had confusion on the date. I signed the letter on the authorisation of PM and sent it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Trump trumpeted the drum of May conflict success the most,” Dar quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Around 60 times, he reiterated that Pakistan shot down six fighter jets of India. Then he praised the prime minister and the field marshal. The relations with the US have started again towards a positive trajectory,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ADR falls to 35pc, IDR goes up to 100pc</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963500/adr-falls-to-35pc-idr-goes-up-to-100pc</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Report finds lending to private sector lowest in Pakistan&lt;br /&gt;• Undocumented economy is 40pc of GDP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KARACHI: The advances to deposits ratio (ADR) further declined from 50 per cent in December 2024 to just 35pc as of June this year, while the investments to deposits ratio (IDR) surged from 90pc to 100pc during the same period, according to a report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Banking Publication 2025 titled “Banking Forward: Journeying Towards Future Horizons” &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com.pk/en/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; by PwC-A.F. Ferguson on Friday said Pakistan’s ADR remains significantly lower than Bang­la­desh at 87pc, India at 79pc and Sri Lanka at 59pc. In contrast, Pakistan’s IDR of 100pc is much higher than Bangladesh at 29pc, India at 33pc and Sri Lanka at 47pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the report, priority sector financing continues to remain at sub-optimal levels, with SME contribution to total loans at 3.7pc and agriculture at 4pc. In comparison, SME lending as a percentage of total loans is considerably higher in other countries, including Indonesia at 19pc, Bangladesh at 17pc and India at 16pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, lending to the private sector declined to 11pc of GDP in 2024. Con­versely, the IDR has increased sharply, rising from 40pc in 2010 to 93pc in 2024 and reaching 100pc as of June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the report, SMEs and the agriculture sector are central to Pakistan’s economy, together representing millions of enterprises across both formal and informal segments. Agriculture contributes 24pc to GDP, while SMEs account for 40pc of GDP, 90pc of enterprises, 30pc of export earnings and employ nearly 30pc of the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agricultural borrowers increased by 200,000, reaching 2.9 million by June 2025, while SME borrowers rose by over 55pc to 277,000 during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report said industry experts emphasised that a large share of Pakistan’s transactions remains cash-based, contributing to an undocumented economy estimated at 40pc of GDP. Digitising a portion of these transactions could save Rs164 billion annually, while reducing the undocumented economy by 25pc has the potential to unlock over Rs1 trillion in resources, the report added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of June 2025, agricultural financing rose to Rs739bn, accounting for 5.2pc of total loans, up from 3.4pc in December 2024. SME lending increased to Rs712bn, representing 5pc of total loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent initiatives by the regulator and the industry have led to notable progress, with financing to priority sectors surpassing 10pc of total loans, indicating a reversal of historical declining trends. “Despite this positive trend, financing levels remain low compared to regional peers, highlighting the need for expanded credit interventions,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts also emphasised the need for sustained fiscal discipline, comprehensive tax reforms, improved governance of state-owned enterprises and reduced government debt to maintain and strengthen economic progress, according to the report. “The urgent need to diversify and expand exports has been stressed upon, advocating a shift from consumption-driven growth to a value-added export base,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts further highlighted that boosting domestic investment and productivity is critical for successful import substitution, which requires removing bureaucra­tic hurdles, simplifying regulations and cre­­ating an investor-friendly environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash continues to pose a challenge to financial inclusion and digitisation, with Pakistan’s cash-in-circulation ratio at 34pc, compared to Bangladesh at 16pc, India at 15pc and Kenya at 9pc, the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, paper-based transactions account for 14pc of total transactions, while ATM traffic constitutes 25pc of e-transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is greater need for broader government and regulatory push to create a wider ecosystem that incentivises digital and disincentivises cash,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report added that the State Bank of Pakistan’s instant payment system, Raast, recorded 45 million registered IDs by June 2025 and processed 1.3bn transactions worth Rs29.6tr, more than doubling in both volume and value compared to the previous year. It said the number of QR-enabled merchants also crossed one million, twice as many as a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, adoption remains uneven across the economy. Only about 159,000 merchants currently use point-of-sale terminals, far fewer than in comparable emerging markets, while mobile banking penetration stands at roughly 15pc of total bank accounts, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/bangladesh-born-hope-trapped-instability-can-become-strategic-liability</link>

A similar dynamic applies to Bangladesh. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PFUJ condemns violence, arson, vandalism targeting media houses in Bangladesh during recent protests</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963364/pfuj-condemns-violence-arson-vandalism-targeting-media-houses-in-bangladesh-during-recent-protests</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) has condemned the recent surge of violence, vandalism, and arson targeting media houses in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A joint statement issued by PFUJ President Afzal Butt, and Secretary General Arshad Ansari on Friday said, “Silencing the press through physical intimidation is a direct violation of the constitutional right to freedom of expression and the rule of law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement comes days after Bangladesh saw violent protests following the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in last year’s student-led uprising that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;toppled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961387&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;shot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka on December 16 while launching his campaign for an election due in February. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;died &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Singapore on December 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following his death, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962210&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;violent protests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; broke out and several buildings, including those housing leading newspapers &lt;em&gt;Prothom Alo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;, were set on fire and vandalised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protesters accused the newspapers of enabling Hadi’s killing, calling them “Delhi’s lapdog” and “Sheikh Hasina’s enabler,” claims the newspapers denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PFUJ statement denounced these “targeted attacks”,  as well as the “deplorable physical assault“ on Nurul Kabir, the veteran editor of &lt;em&gt;New Age&lt;/em&gt; newspaper and president of  Editors’ Council of Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PFUJ also expressed deep concern over reports that more than 100 journalists in Bangladesh remain detained without trial, demanding their immediate and unconditional release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the statement highlighted a “disturbing regional trend”, pointing to similar violence in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just months ago, mob attacks targeted the &lt;em&gt;Kantipur Group&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Annapurna Post&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Image TV&lt;/em&gt;,” the statement said, adding that the PFUJ leadership also paid tribute to photojournalist Suresh Rajak of &lt;em&gt;Avenews TV&lt;/em&gt;, who tragically died in an arson attack on March 28, 2025, in Kathmandu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PFUJ noted with “regret that perpetrators of these crimes remain unaccountable”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It called upon the governments concerned to conduct fair, impartial, and speedy investigations into all incidents of arson and violence; identify and bring the perpetrators to justice to end the culture of impunity; and ensure the safety of journalists as they perform their professional duties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Violence and harassment aimed at silencing the media are unacceptable in any democratic society,” the statement concluded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lay of the land</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963333/lay-of-the-land</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;AS we close 2025, it is time to take a hard and honest look at the lay of the land of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 78 years after independence, Pakistan’s politics remains deeply unsettled. Of these years, approximately 33 were spent under four periods of direct military rule, with the remainder under various shades of indirect or hybrid regimes. It took 23 years for the country to hold its first general elections. To date, Pakistan has had 29 prime ministers — including caretakers and repeat tenures — yet not a single one has completed a full five-year constitutional term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decline is not destiny. All these crises are man-made and reversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962166&quot;&gt;assassinated&lt;/a&gt; in 1951. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dawn.com/news/1160422&quot;&gt;executed&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. Benazir Bhutto was &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;http://beta.dawn.com/news/282033/benazir-is-dead&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;assassinated&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. Former PM Imran Khan has been incarcerated for nearly two years and sentenced to a cumulative 51 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Externally, Pakistan has fought four major wars with India — in 1947-48, 1965, 1971, and 1999 — and continues to experience border tensions, including earlier this year in May. The dismemberment of the country in 1971 remains a major national trauma. In 1998, Pakistan became one of the world’s nine nuclear-armed states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demographic pressures have compounded these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1947, West Pakistan’s population was approximately 32.7 million; today Pakistan’s population is close to 250m. East Pakistan, with a population of around 40m in 1947, as Bangladesh is now roughly 177m people. Pakistan’s population growth has outpaced its ability to govern, grow, educate, employ, and provide basic services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key determinants of national development — political stability, governance, respect for the Constitution and rule of law, inclusive institutions, economic growth, security, corruption control, and quality of life — are all in visible decline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politically, Pakistan lurches from one crisis to another. The current conflict is among the most serious in recent history. Since the tragic events of May 9, 2023, political polarisation has only intensified. At the heart of this crisis lies the unresolved question of civil-military relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security challenges further darken the picture. Cross-border terrorism is on the rise, insurgency continues in Balochistan, and relations with neighbouring countries have deteriorated, including now Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governance failures are equally stark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the 18th Constitutional Amendment, provinces were granted authority and resources to manage policing, infrastructure, water and sanitation, health, education, and local governments. Yet provincial governments have largely failed to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local government elections are routinely delayed or avoided to prevent the devolution of power and resources. Instead, development funds are distributed through MNAs and MPAs, fostering patronage, inefficiency, and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite long tenures — PPP in Sindh since 2008, PTI in KP since 2013, and repeated PML-N governments in Punjab over decades — the quality of governance and service delivery remains dismal. In southern Punjab and other marginalised regions, conditions are particularly dire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Constitution itself has been weakened. Politically motivated amendments, notably the 26th and 27th, have eroded judicial independence. Fundamental rights guaranteed under Part II, Chapter One of the Constitution are routinely violated, as are the Principles of Policy outlined in Chapter Two. Laws such as PECA, 2016, are increasingly used to suppress dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The erosion of the rule of law is reflected in global rankings. The World Justice Project defines the rule of law as the foundation of justice, opportunity, and peace. In its 2024 index covering 143 countries, Pakistan scored 0.37, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/documents/Pakistan_1.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ranking 130th&lt;/a&gt; overall. Among South Asian countries, only Afghanistan ranks lower. Most alarming is Pakistan’s last-place ranking — 143 out of 143 — in the “order and security” category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economically, the situation is grim. Pakistan’s average growth rate over the past three years stands at just 1.7 per cent — the lowest for any three consecutive years in the country’s history. Approximately 45pc of the population lives below or near the poverty line, while unofficial unemployment assessment is at 22pc. This means nearly every second Pakistani is poor or near-poor, every fourth citizen is unemployed, and youth unemployment is even higher. Inflation over the past three to four years has reduced purchasing power by an estimated 65pc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxation levels are among the highest in the world, with salaried classes bearing a disproportionate brunt. Corporations face effective tax rates of around 60pc, while electricity tariffs are higher than in most comparable countries. The cost of doing business has become prohibitively high, driving companies out of Pakistan and depressing investment to historic lows, despite official claims that the economy has ‘stabilised.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s Human Development Index ranking has steadily worsened over the past decade. In 2024, Pakistan ranked 168 out of 193 countries, with all South Asian states except Afghanistan performing better. Health and education systems are in crisis: 40pc of children are stunted, and an estimated 40pc of school-age children are out of school. Pakistan ranks among the worst globally for neonatal mortality, hepatitis C prevalence, and type-II diabetes, and remains one of only two countries where polio has not been eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women — half the population — continue to face systemic discrimination, exclusion, and lack of voice. In the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2025, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1916743&quot;&gt;Pakistan ranked last&lt;/a&gt;: 148 out of 148 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the sobering reality as 2025 draws to a close. But decline is not destiny. All these crises are man-made and therefore reversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History offers perspective. In 1965, Pakistan’s GDP per capita was comparable to that of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea. Today, all are far ahead. In the 1990s, Pakistan was South Asia’s richest country and ranked above both India and Bangladesh on the Human Development Index. Many of these countries faced deep political and economic crises, yet emerged through sustained reforms, institutional strengthening, and political consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credible economists now agree that Pakistan’s current economic model is unsustainable. Yet recovery remains possible — if the country undertakes fundamental shifts in governance, economic policy, and institutional integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, everything hinges on politics. Without resolving the present political conflict and its underlying causes, no economic or social reform can sustainably succeed. Pakistan urgently needs a broad national consensus on a new direction. As the new year approaches, such consensus appears distressingly distant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Who is Tarique Rahman, and why his return to Bangladesh after 17 years is being keenly watched in India</title>
      <link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/who-is-tarique-rahman-and-why-his-return-to-bangladesh-after-17-years-is-being-keenly-watched-in-india/articleshow/126182658.cms</link>
      <description>Tarique Rahman, acting chairman of the BNP, has returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in exile, ahead of the February 12 parliamentary elections. His arrival reshapes the political landscape following Sheikh Hasina&apos;s ouster and amid ongoing political violence. India is closely monitoring these developments due to regional implications.</description>

      <title>Dhaka-Delhi rupture</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963334/dhaka-delhi-rupture</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TIES between Bangladesh and India are experiencing extreme turbulence, especially after the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961387&quot;&gt; murder&lt;/a&gt; of prominent Bangladeshi student leader Sharif Osman Hadi, with his supporters and sympathisers claiming he was killed at India’s behest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week a Hindutva mob &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808&quot;&gt;tried to storm&lt;/a&gt; the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi, while attacks on Bangladeshi diplomatic missions in other Indian cities have also been reported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extremist groups in India such as the VHP are using the tragic lynching of a Bangladeshi Hindu man in Mymensingh as an excuse to target Dhaka’s missions in India. Bangladesh’s interim authorities had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962902&quot;&gt;summoned&lt;/a&gt; the Indian high commissioner in Dhaka to protest against attacks on their missions in India, while Dhaka’s representative in Delhi was similarly summoned in a tit-for-tat exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim foreign minister has said his country’s top diplomat in India had received death threats. The Indian state, meanwhile, has tried to downplay the events, particularly attempts by extremist mobs to target Bangladeshi missions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s rule, Dhaka and Delhi were very much on the same page. However, anti-India feeling in Bangladesh has erupted after Ms Wajed’s government was toppled last year, with many seeing Delhi as supporting her authoritarian rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Sheikh Hasina fled to India after last year’s uprising has done little to dispel this impression. Moreover, reports that Osman Hadi’s suspected killer escaped to India have further added to the anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the key reason behind the fraying of ties between both states is India’s patronising attitude towards its neighbours. Delhi should cooperate with Dhaka to trace Hadi’s killers, and should refrain from meddling in Bangladesh’s internal affairs and fanning communal fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that for there to be peace and amity in South Asia, the sovereignty of all states must be respected, and no state must act as if it is the regional hegemon, free to throw its weight around and bully others.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan emerges as main recipient of Chinese combat aircraft</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963311/pakistan-emerges-as-main-recipient-of-chinese-combat-aircraft</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: China continues to strengthen its position as a major global arms supplier, with Pakistan emerging as its most significant and trusted partner in the air combat domain, according to a Pentagon report sent to the US Congress this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report states that as of December 2024, China remained the world’s fourth-largest arms exporter, relying primarily on state-owned defence companies such as the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and North Industries Corporation (Norinco).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It notes that China’s arms exports are closely linked to its broader foreign policy and development outreach, including initiatives associated with the Belt and Road framework, and are particularly attractive to developing countries due to affordability and flexible terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this report, Pakistan figures prominently in China’s aviation exports. Beijing currently offers three fixed-wing combat aircraft for export: the fifth-generation FC-31 stealth fighter, the fourth-generation J-10C multirole combat aircraft, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1956309&quot;&gt;JF-17&lt;/a&gt; Thunder, which is jointly developed and produced by China and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the report confirms that Pakistan is the only country to which China has exported the J-10C. As of May 2025, China had delivered 20 J-10C aircraft to the Pakistan Air Force under two orders placed since 2020, with total orders amounting to 36 aircraft. While several other countries — including Egypt, Uzbekistan, Indonesia, Iran and Bangladesh — have expressed interest, no J-10C exports beyond Pakistan have taken place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pentagon report says Beijing has strengthened its position as major arms supplier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also highlights the JF-17 programme as a successful example of defence collaboration between two developing countries. Jointly produced by Pakistan and China, the aircraft is already in service with multiple air forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2024, Azerbaijan, Myanmar and Nigeria were operating the JF-17, while Iraq was reported to be in discussions. For Pakistan, the aircraft remains a central component of its air force as well as an important defence export.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to manned aircraft, the Pentagon report notes that China has supplied Pakistan with advanced, strike-capable unma­nned aerial vehicles, including the Caihong and Wing Loong series. These systems have also been exported to several other countries, reflecting China’s growing role in the global UAV market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond aviation, the report says China exports a wide range of military equipment across land, air defence and naval domains. Pakistan is identified as a long-standing recipient of Chinese naval platforms, including four frigates delivered in 2017 and 2018. The report adds that China is expected to expand its naval exports in the coming years, with Pakistan remaining among its core partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon assessment attributes China’s growing appeal in the global arms market to competitive pricing, flexible financing and the absence of restrictive political conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, the defence relationship with China is not limited to arms purchases but reflects a mature partnership encompassing joint development, production and long-term strategic cooperation, the report notes.&lt;/p&gt;
