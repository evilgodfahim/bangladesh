      <title>Telenor sells its stake in Thailand’s True Corporation for $3.9 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968445/telenor-sells-its-stake-in-thailands-true-corporation-for-39-billion</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Telenor said on Thursday it would sell its 30.3 per cent stake in Thailand’s True Corporation for $3.92 billion, its second divestment from Asia in recent months, lifting the Norwegian group’s shares 8 pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telenor said it had signed an agreement with Arise Digital Technology Company, owned by Khun Suphachai Chearavanont, to sell 24.95 pc in True and then its remaining 5.35 pc stake two years after the closing of the initial deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telenor has been a major investor in Asian telecoms since the 1990s, building operations in Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia and Pakistan, but has recently said it is open to deals as the industry matures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#may-also-do-deals-in-malaysia-bangladesh&quot; id=&quot;may-also-do-deals-in-malaysia-bangladesh&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;May also do deals in Malaysia, Bangladesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the completion of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1797960&quot;&gt;sale of Telenor Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; in December, and the agreement to sell our shares in True we have taken big steps in delivering on that strategy,” Telenor CEO Benedicte Schilbred Fasmer said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telenor’s other Asian companies, Malaysia’s CelcomDigi where it owns 33.1 pc and Grameenphone where it holds a 55.8 pc stake, could also become subject to deals, the group said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s business as usual until such time that any opportunities present themselves,” Chief Financial Officer Torbjorn Wist told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know we’re going to be focusing on delivering value to our remaining assets in Malaysia and Bangladesh. And then over time, we’ll see if we can find structural opportunities for those as well,” Wist said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True is one of Thailand’s biggest telecom operators with around 60 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telenor will book an accounting gain of 14.7b Norwegian crowns at the current exchange rate at the closing of the initial stake sale and said it aimed to provide further information next month on the use of the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divestment, which is expected to close within a few months, is projected to boost Telenor’s return on capital employed and underpins the company’s goal of focusing more of its business in the Nordic region, it said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh parties launch campaigns for first post-Hasina elections</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968417/bangladesh-parties-launch-campaigns-for-first-post-hasina-elections</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh began official campaigning on Thursday for the hugely anticipated general &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1960599&quot;&gt;elections&lt;/a&gt; next month, the first since the 2024 uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ended&lt;/a&gt; the autocratic rule of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;Sheikh Hasina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters of key frontrunner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) crowded the streets of the northern city of Sylhet, chanting his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have liberated the country from autocratic rule,” prime ministerial hopeful Rahman, who returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile, told crowds of BNP loyalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now we must establish the rights of the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman vowed to create jobs for “millions of unemployed youth” and support women’s economic independence. “Do we have a leader? Yes, we do,” BNP loyalists shouted, carrying placards of Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) supporters gather for a rally ahead of the upcoming national election, in Sylhet on Jan 22, 2026. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/22122529a6e00af.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) supporters gather for a rally ahead of the upcoming national election, in Sylhet on Jan 22, 2026. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key rival Jamaat-i-Islami began its campaign in the capital Dhaka, after being crushed during Hasina’s 15 years in power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat’s leader Shafiqur Rahman said he wanted to clamp down on corruption and build a nation where “people from all races, religions and communities will be treated equally”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the sea of Jamaat supporters was 36-year-old Kakoli Akter, who said it was the first election rally she had ever attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although eligible to vote since 2008, she said this would be the first time she would cast a ballot, as she could finally support the party of her choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Asian nation votes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1960599&quot;&gt;February 12&lt;/a&gt; to elect 350 lawmakers — polls that will bring in new leadership after prolonged turmoil following the ouster of Hasina’s government, reshaping domestic politics and regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes against the backdrop of insecurity — including the murder last month of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962252&quot;&gt;student leader&lt;/a&gt; of the anti-Hasina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1882265&quot;&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; — as well as warnings of a “flood” of online disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union election observers say the vote will be the “biggest democratic process of 2026”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#progress-of-reform&quot; id=&quot;progress-of-reform&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Progress of reform’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarique Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP following the death of his mother, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;died in December&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bangladesh&amp;rsquo;s Jamaat-i-Islami leader Shafiqur Rahman waves to his supporters during a rally as he begins campaigning ahead of the upcoming national elections, in Mirpur on Jan 22, 2026. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/22181911f2e10d3.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, home to one of the world’s largest Muslim-majority populations, has a significant Sufi following, and Tarique Zia followed tradition to launch his campaigns in Sylhet, home to the centuries-old shrine of Shah Jalal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He will carry forward the legacy of his parents,” said Harunur Rashid, a 40-year-old die-hard BNP supporter, referring to Zia and her husband, former president Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-i-Islami, which opposes Sufi mystical interpretations, began its campaign in the capital Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-i-Islami is seeking a return to formal politics after years of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1855267&quot;&gt;bans&lt;/a&gt; and crackdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Hasina fled to India, key Jamaat leaders have been released from prison, and groups have grown increasingly assertive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963842/bangladeshs-national-citizen-party-new-hope-that-looks-like-the-old-guard&quot;&gt;National Citizen Party&lt;/a&gt; (NCP), formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising — now allied with Jamaat — launched their campaign with its chief Nahid Islam urging voters to “carry forward the progress of reform”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineer Raqibul Hasan Shawon, 26, watched the BNP rally from the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t decided whom to vote for yet,” he said. “We have heard commitments before, but they were never fulfilled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#new-bangladesh&quot; id=&quot;new-bangladesh&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘New Bangladesh’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;returned from exile&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024 at the behest of protesters to lead a caretaker government as “chief adviser”, will step down after the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus said he inherited a “completely broken” political system, and championed a reform charter he argues is vital to prevent a return to authoritarian rule, with a referendum on the changes to be held on the same day as polling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you cast the ‘yes’ vote, the door to building the new Bangladesh will open,” Yunus said on January 19, in a broadcast to the nation urging support for the referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, he warned he was “concerned about the impact” a surge of disinformation could have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have flooded social media with fake news, rumours and speculation,” Yunus said, blaming both “foreign media and local sources”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations with neighbouring India have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957625&quot;&gt;soured&lt;/a&gt;, after Hasina escaped to her old ally New Delhi as protesters stormed her palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, 78, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power, remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Pakistan is reportedly considering a boycott of the upcoming T20 World Cup 2026 if Bangladesh decides against participating due to its refusal to play matches in India over security concerns. Sources told Geo News that Pakistan’s stance depends on the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) response to Bangladesh’s request to relocate its matches.

      <title>Bangladesh firm on not playing T20 World Cup in India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413/bangladesh-firm-on-not-playing-t20-world-cup-in-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will not travel to India to play in next month’s T20 World Cup, its cricket board said on Thursday, effectively ruling the country out of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/bangladesh-firm-on-not-playing-t20-world-cup-in-india-despite-icc-saying-they-will-be-replaced-1520515&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESPN Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the decision was announced after a meeting in Dhaka between Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam Bulbul, CEO Nizamuddin, Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul and several national team players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our only demand is to play the World Cup – but not in India,” the BCB president told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that it would not be making any changes to the World Cup schedule or groups, days after Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;requested&lt;/a&gt; that its matches be moved to Sri Lanka after refusing to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will go back to the ICC with our plan to play in Sri Lanka,” the BCB president said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They did give us a 24-hour ultimatum but a global body can’t really do that. ICC will miss out on 200 million people watching the World Cup (if Bangladesh is axed). It will be their loss…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh is a cricket-loving nation. If a country of nearly 200 million people misses the World Cup, the ICC will lose a huge audience,” the BCB’s Bulbul said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cricket is entering the Olympics in 2028, Brisbane in 2032, India is bidding for 2036. Excluding a major cricket-loving country like Bangladesh would be a failure,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Nazrul said, “There is no scope for changing our decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Bangladesh’s security concerns “did not arise from speculation or theoretical analysis”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They arose from a real incident – where one of our country’s top players was forced to bow to extremists, and the Indian cricket board asked him to leave India,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are hopeful that ICC will give us the opportunity to play in Sri Lanka,” Nazrul said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following yesterday’s decision by the ICC, Islam had said Bangladesh players were keen to play in the World Cup and that he was “hoping for a miracle from the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who doesn’t want to play in the World Cup?” Islam said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh players want to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh government wants Bangladesh to play the World Cup. But we don’t think India is safe for our players,” Islam had said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968417/bangladesh-launches-campaigns-for-first-post-hasina-elections</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh began official campaigning on Thursday for the hugely anticipated general elections next month, the first since the 2024 uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ended&lt;/a&gt; the autocratic rule of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;Sheikh Hasina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters of key frontrunner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) crowded the streets of the northern city of Sylhet, chanting his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do we have a leader? Yes, we do,” BNP loyalists shouted, carrying placards of the prime ministerial hopeful Rahman, who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami will begin its campaign in the capital Dhaka later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Asian nation of 170 million votes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1960599&quot;&gt;February 12&lt;/a&gt; to elect 350 lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The polls are expected to usher in new leadership after prolonged turmoil following the ouster of Hasina’s government, reshaping domestic politics and regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes against the backdrop of insecurity — including the murder last month of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962252&quot;&gt;student leader&lt;/a&gt; of the anti-Hasina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1882265&quot;&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; — as well as warnings of a “flood” of online disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union election observers say the vote will be the “biggest democratic process of 2026”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#never-fulfilled&quot; id=&quot;never-fulfilled&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Never fulfilled’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP following the death of his mother, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;died in December&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He will carry forward the legacy of his parents,” said Harun Ur Rashid, a 40-year-old die-hard BNP supporter, referring to Zia and her husband, former president Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, home to one of the world’s largest Muslim-majority populations, has a significant Sufi following, and parties have traditionally launched campaigns in Sylhet, home to the centuries-old shrine of Shah Jalal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters lined the streets on Wednesday night as Rahman prayed at the shrine, cheering as his election bus passed by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-i-Islami, which opposes Sufi mystical interpretations, begins its campaign in the capital Dhaka, in the constituency of its leader Shafiqur Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-i-Islami is seeking a return to formal politics after years of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1855267&quot;&gt;bans&lt;/a&gt; and crackdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Hasina fled to India, key Jamaat leaders have been released from prison, and groups have grown increasingly assertive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963842/bangladeshs-national-citizen-party-new-hope-that-looks-like-the-old-guard&quot;&gt;National Citizen Party&lt;/a&gt; (NCP), formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising, and who have formed an alliance with Jamaat, will also launch their rally in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineer Raqibul Hasan Shawon, 26, watched the BNP rally from the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t decided whom to vote for yet,” he said. “We have heard commitments before, but they were never fulfilled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#new-bangladesh&quot; id=&quot;new-bangladesh&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘New Bangladesh’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;returned from exile&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024 at the behest of protesters to lead a caretaker government as “chief adviser”, will step down after the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus said he inherited a “completely broken” political system, and championed a reform charter he argues is vital to prevent a return to authoritarian rule, with a referendum on the changes to be held on the same day as polling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you cast the ‘yes’ vote, the door to building the new Bangladesh will open,” Yunus said on January 19, in a broadcast to the nation urging support for the referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, he warned he was “concerned about the impact” a surge of disinformation could have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have flooded social media with fake news, rumours and speculation,” Yunus said, blaming both “foreign media and local sources”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations with neighbouring India have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957625&quot;&gt;soured&lt;/a&gt;, after Hasina escaped to her old ally New Delhi as protesters stormed her palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, 78, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power, remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh seek ‘miracle’ to secure T20 World Cup participation</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413/bangladesh-seek-miracle-to-secure-t20-world-cup-participation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) will speak to the country’s interim government in a last-ditch attempt to secure the team’s participation in next month’s Twenty20 World Cup after their demand to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;shift their matches&lt;/a&gt; outside India was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) board has dismissed Bangladesh’s concerns about the safety and security of their players and fans in India, citing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968211&quot;&gt;political tension&lt;/a&gt; between the South Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their demands to play their matches in Sri Lanka shot down by the game’s global governing body, Bangladesh find themselves left with the difficult options of either withdrawing their demand or getting replaced by another team in the global showpiece that begins on February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I asked the ICC board for time to talk to my government for one last time,” BCB president Aminul Islam told reporters after learning of the ICC decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said it’s a valid point and gave me 24 or 48 hours to get back to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that India is not secure for us. We remain in the stance that we want to play in Sri Lanka. I know the ICC denied us, but we will talk to the government one more time. I will inform the ICC about the government’s feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aware of a potential backlash that would follow any volte-face about playing in India, Aminul said the players were keen to play in the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am hoping for a miracle from the ICC. Who doesn’t want to play in the World Cup?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh players want to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh government wants Bangladesh to play the World Cup. But we don’t think India is safe for our players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations have soured between the neighbours in recent times and cricket has been affected too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; from this year’s Indian Premier League (IPL) despite him signing with its Kolkata franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh responded by banning IPL broadcasts in the country and demanding to play their World Cup matches in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Pakistan expressed disappointment as the International Cricket Council rejected Bangladesh&apos;s request to move T20 World Cup matches from India, despite Pakistan backing Bangladesh&apos;s stance in principle. However, Pakistan has clarified that withdrawing from the tournament is not an option, as they are already scheduled to play at a neutral venue.</description>

      <title>ICC rejects Bangladesh’s plea to play T20 World Cup matches outside India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday announced that it would not be making any changes to the Men’s T20 World Cup schedule or groups, days after Bangladesh requested that its matches be moved to Sri Lanka after refusing to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T20 World Cup begins on February 7 with Bangladesh in England’s Group C. The team is scheduled to play all of their group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/tournaments/mens-t20-world-cup-2026/news/icc-upholds-current-match-schedule-for-men-s-t20-world-cup-2026&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt;issued on Wednesday, the ICC said the decision was reached after “considering all security assessments conducted, including independent reviews, all of which indicated there was no threat to Bangladesh players, media persons, officials and fans at any tournament venues in the country”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ICC/status/2013958324618920299?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was noted that it was not feasible to make changes so close to the tournament and that altering the schedule under the circumstances, in the absence of any credible security threat, could set a precedent that would jeopardise the sanctity of future ICC events and undermine its neutrality as a global governing body,” the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, an ICC spokesperson said that the governing body had engaged the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) for the past few weeks with the “clear objective of enabling Bangladesh’s participation in the tournament”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that despite these efforts, the BCB repeatedly linked its participation “to a single, isolated and unrelated development concerning one of its player’s involvement in a domestic league”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This linkage has no bearing on the tournament’s security framework or the conditions governing participation in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, &lt;em&gt;Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/icc-to-replace-bangladesh-at-t20-world-cup-if-they-don-t-travel-to-india-1520371&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the ICC had given the BCB one more day to confer with the Bangladesh government about whether its team would travel to India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should they continue to refuse, the ICC Board will replace Bangladesh with Scotland in the tournament, based on team rankings, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late on Tuesday night, the Bangladesh government’s sports adviser Asif Nazrul had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968106/cannot-be-pressurised-to-play-in-india-says-bangladesh-sports-adviser&quot;&gt;reiterated &lt;/a&gt;that under no condition would the national team travel to India for the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the ICC bows to pressure from the Indian cricket board and tries to impose pressure on us by setting unreasonable conditions, we will not accept those conditions,” Nazrul had told reporters, according to the &lt;em&gt;Press Trust of India&lt;/em&gt; (PTI) news agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past, there are examples that Pakistan said that they will not travel to India and ICC changed the venue. We have asked to change the venue on logical ground and we cannot be pressurised to play in India by putting illogical pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Revolutionary Politics Replacing Constitutional Rule In Bangladesh?</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/revolutionary-politics-replacing-constitutional-rule-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The strategic consequences extend well beyond Dhaka. Bangladesh occupies a critical position in the Bay of Bengal, bordering major sea lanes and neighboring one of the world’s most volatile regions. A Bangladesh drifting toward extra-constitutional governance while deepening ties with China and Pakistan would alter regional dynamics in ways that merit serious attention in Washington and European capitals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cannot be pressurised to play in India, says Bangladesh sports adviser</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968106/cannot-be-pressurised-to-play-in-india-says-bangladesh-sports-adviser</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh government’s sports adviser Asif Nazrul on Tuesday reiterated that under no condition would the national team travel to India for the T20 World Cup, despite an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967846&quot;&gt;ultimatum&lt;/a&gt; from the International Cricket Council (ICC) to the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on deciding its participation by January 21, the &lt;em&gt;Press Trust of India&lt;/em&gt; (PTI) news agency reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If BCB remains adamant on not travelling to India for the 20-team tournament, Scotland is likely to replace Bangladesh as per current rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am not aware that Scotland will be included in our place,” Asif told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the ICC bows to pressure from the Indian cricket board and tries to impose pressure on us by setting unreasonable conditions, we will not accept those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past, there are examples that Pakistan said that they will not travel to India and ICC changed the venue. We have asked to change the venue on logical ground and we cannot be pressurised to play in India by putting illogical pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standoff was triggered by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;removal &lt;/a&gt;of Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman from Kolkata Knight Riders’ roster for this year’s Indian Premier League on Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) instructions for unspecified “developments all around”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing security concerns and national pride, the BCB responded by announcing its national team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;won’t travel to India&lt;/a&gt; for its group stage games in Kolkata and Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCB wants to play each of its four group-stage matches in Sri Lanka, where the marquee India-Pakistan clash will also be held as per the mutually agreed arrangement for ICC events until 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh is currently placed in Group ‘C’ along with the West Indies, Italy, England and Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its last meeting with ICC officials in Dhaka, the BCB had proposed swapping positions with Ireland in Group ‘B’, which features tournament co-hosts Sri Lanka, Australia, Oman and Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a move would allow Bangladesh to remain in Sri Lanka for entirety of its group-stage engagements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the BCB considers it unsafe for its players to travel to India, the ICC’s risk assessment report did not flag any specific or direct threat to the team’s participation in the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bilateral relations between India and Bangladesh have deteriorated in recent months, exacerbated by the reported killings of Hindus in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal and current Test skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto have cautioned against a very hard-line approach on the controversial subject, with the former saying that decisions taken today would have repercussions 10 years down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>India to withdraw diplomats’ families from Bangladesh, source says</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968211/india-to-withdraw-diplomats-families-from-bangladesh-source-says</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;India will withdraw its diplomats’ families and dependents from Bangladesh in the face of security threats as tension rises ahead of a February 12 general &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1960599&quot;&gt;election&lt;/a&gt;, an Indian official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaigning begins on Thursday for Bangladesh’s election, which has sparked protests and counter-protests. Ties between the South Asian neighbours soured after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;fled&lt;/a&gt; to India in 2024, following deadly protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s past support for Hasina has frayed relations between the two neighbours since her overthrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s withdrawal move was part of “internal readjustments”, the official said, without elaborating. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, pointed to Indian media reports of New Delhi’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear when the families would return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreign ministries of India and Bangladesh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961779&quot;&gt;summoned&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh’s high commissioner, or ambassador to voice its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962623&quot;&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt; over what it called a deteriorating security situation there, particularly threats targeting the Indian mission in the capital, Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s ex-premier Hasina was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to death in November after a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on the student-led uprising in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has repeatedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1956992&quot;&gt;sought&lt;/a&gt; Hasina’s extradition to Bangladesh, while rejecting New Delhi’s concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a popular student leader of Bangladesh’s 2024 uprising, Sharif Osman Hadi, was wounded in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961387&quot;&gt;assassination attempt&lt;/a&gt; last month and died after being flown to Singapore for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi was a senior leader of the student protest group Inqilab Mancha and an outspoken critic of India. His death set off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962210&quot;&gt;violent protests &lt;/a&gt;with angry mobs torching several buildings, including two major newspapers deemed to favour India, as well as a prominent cultural institution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>T20 WC: &apos;No sense&apos; - Pakistan questioned for halting prep in support of B&apos;desh</title>

      <description>Reports claiming Pakistan has halted T20 World Cup 2026 preparations in support of Bangladesh have been dismissed by former cricketers. Kamran Akmal called the idea illogical, stressing no official PCB or government statement exists. Basit Ali said any decision depends on the government and noted broadcasters would oppose withdrawal, especially due to the India–Pakistan match. The issue stems from Bangladesh’s refusal to play in India over security concerns.</description>

				&lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;WINDHOEK: Australian opener Will Malajczuk plays a shot during the U-19 World Cup match against Japan at the High Performance Oval on Tuesday.—Courtesy ICC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HARARE: Australia recorded a comfortable win against Japan in their second match of the U-19 World Cup to book a place in the Super 6s on Tuesday. Meanwhile, points were shared again in Bulawayo after the game between New Zealand and Bangladesh was abandoned due to rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan opted to bat first after winning the toss and despite losing Nikhil Pol early, were able to set a platform to post a competitive score on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nihar Parmar and Hugo Tani-Kelly built a solid 58-run partnership that was ended by a smart piece of Australian fielding as Parmar was run out on 33. But Tani-Kelly, the centurion in the last game, was in fine form and continued to aid the Japanese cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was supported well by Charles Hinze after the departure of Parmar, adding 24 runs off 22 balls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after his dismissal, Tani-Kelly kept running out of partners until Montgomery Hinze, whose 29 off 51 allowed Tani-Kelly to take Japan’s score past the 200-run mark&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tani-Kelly was the pillar of the Japanese innings as he remained unbeaten on 79, setting the defending champions a target of 202.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s opening pair sniffed out any chance of a threat in the second innings with a power-packed opening partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Malajczuk and Nitesh Samuel posted a 135-run stand in just 15 overs to put Australia on course for the win. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malajczuk scored a 51-ball hundred to record the fastest-ever century in U-19 World Cup history. His knock of 102 in 55 deliveries gave Australia enough momentum for them cruise to a win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samuel remained unbeaten on 60 as Australia eased to an eight-wicket win to book their place in the Super 6s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia next face Sri Lanka, who also have a perfect record in the tournament so far on Friday while Japan take on Ireland on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand and Bangladesh had to settle for a share of the spoils after rain only allowed 10 overs of play on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh had asked New Zealand to bat first after winning the toss and the Kiwis had got off to a good start thanks to Aryandeep Mann and captain Thomas Jones, who came in after the loss of Hugo Bogue’s wicket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the heavens opened at the end of the 10th over, allowing no further play as the game was called off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is New Zealand’s second straight game that has been abandoned due to rain. They next face India on Saturday, while Bangladesh take on USA a day earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

The UK clings to neoliberal ideas while households pay the price&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/18d75e20-b63e-4f47-8f63-58c0cc4bca22&quot;&gt;Food policy&lt;/a&gt; across much of the world is changing. But not in Britain. That may be a costly mistake as the prices of essentials rise because of the climate emergency, geopolitical tensions and the fragility of just-in-time supply chains. Many capitals are now reviving their strategic food reserves. European nations such as Sweden, Finland, Norway and Germany are rebuilding stocks dismantled after the cold war. Climate shocks have led to Egypt and Bangladesh boosting similar programmes. Countries such as Brazil and Indonesia – sensitive to the food needs of their vast populations – are also expanding their reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK, by contrast, has no substantial public food reserves. Its strategy rests almost entirely on global markets and private intentions – an approach shaped by decades of liberalised trade. Even in the event of war, the official advice focuses on households &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-households-told-stockpile-one-36048517&quot;&gt;stockpiling&lt;/a&gt; essentials. In Britain’s view, food security is&amp;nbsp;about prices, not scarcity of supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      <description>Bangladesh’s student leaders, one of the main driving forces behind the mass protests that brought down former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024, now face an uncertain political future.
Despite their central role in the uprising, the youth movement has been granted only a small share of parliamentary seats under a new electoral alliance led by Jamaat-e-Islami – an Islamist party that was long politically marginalised but has re-emerged as a central player.
Under the agreement, the student-led...</description>

      <title>JazzWorld locks Rs75bn swap deal with UBL</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967972/jazzworld-locks-rs75bn-swap-deal-with-ubl</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;KARACHI: JazzWorld, an integrated digital services company, has executed Pakistan’s largest-ever interest rate swap (IRS) transaction of Rs75 billion with United Bank Ltd (UBL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interest rate swap is a financial contract under which two parties exchange interest payment obligations, typically swapping a fixed interest rate for a floating rate for a predetermined amount over a specified period. Such instruments allow borrowers to better manage interest rate risk or secure more favourable financing terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jazz’s Chief Financial Officer Farrukh Khan said that in Pakistan, most corporate loans are on variable rates, which adjust every three to six months. “For our growth, we borrow long term, but until now, we had no certainty over future interest costs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, most corporate loans are extended on a variable-rate basis, with interest rates rising or falling every three to six months, depending on the facility. For growth, Jazz typically borrows long-term, often for up to 10 years, but without certainty over whether future interest costs will be higher or lower, which creates significant uncertainty, particularly in the local volatile operating environment, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRS covers about Rs35bn for five years and the balance for seven years, representing roughly 28-29 per cent of Jazz’s total debt. “While the majority of our debt remains variable, this transaction reduces uncertainty in financing costs and cash flows, allowing us to focus on revenue growth and business development,” Mr Khan added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jazz is among the largest borrowers in the country, Mr Khan said, adding that with upcoming spectrum auctions on the horizon, the company expects its borrowing requirements to increase further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a note by Arif Habib Limited (AHL), the benchmark Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (Kibor) on the prevailing floating-rate loan was last reset in November 2025, with the total borrowing cost estimated at 11.5-12.0pc, based on the six-month Kibor plus 60 basis points. By fixing the rate through the swap, Jazz secures greater cost predictability and insulates itself against the risk of future interest rate increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Praising Pakistan’s progress in its digital and financial systems, Borak Ozer, Chief Financial Officer of Jazz’s parent company Veon, said it would like to replicate its success in other countries. “From a revenue perspective, Pakistan is our flagship entity, and we would like to copy-paste the model here to Bangladesh,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Pakistan has halted preparations for the T20 World Cup 2026, backing Bangladesh&apos;s refusal to play in India due to security concerns. Islamabad has indicated it may withdraw if the issue isn&apos;t resolved, following Bangladesh&apos;s withdrawal from the IPL. The ICC is reluctant to shift Bangladesh&apos;s matches, potentially leading to Scotland&apos;s replacement.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh face deadline over refusal to play T20 World Cup matches in India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967846/bangladesh-face-deadline-over-refusal-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) has told Bangladesh to agree to play their matches at next month’s T20 World Cup in India or risk being kicked out of the tournament, reports said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T20 World Cup begins on February 7 with Bangladesh in England’s Group C and scheduled to play all of their group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967503&quot;&gt;held talks&lt;/a&gt; in Dhaka at the weekend with ICC officials over the impasse, but no agreement was reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the discussions, the BCB reiterated its formal request to the ICC to relocate Bangladesh’s matches to Sri Lanka,” a BCB statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC have not officially commented, but website &lt;em&gt;Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt; and other Indian media reported on Monday that the deadline of Wednesday had been set for Dhaka to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC sources have told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; that Bangladesh could be replaced by Scotland, who are the highest-ranked team who did not qualify for the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One suggestion was for Bangladesh to swap with Group B’s Ireland, whose matches are in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Among other points, the possibility of moving Bangladesh to a different group as a means of facilitating the matter with minimum logistical adjustments was discussed,” said the BCB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will play all their matches in Colombo under an ICC agreement with India to play at neutral venues in global or regional tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The row erupted on January 3, when the IPL’s Kolkata Knight Riders were ordered by India’s cricket board to drop Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman, sparking fury in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations between India and Bangladesh soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan’s exchange rate illusion</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967697/pakistans-exchange-rate-illusion</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The exchange rate is a critical economic variable for Pakistan. A competitive and credible currency regime should form the core of the nation’s economic strategy, particularly given the country’s dependence on foreign exchange for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Pakistan has repeatedly used the exchange rate as a short-term stabilisation tool, often holding it at levels that favour political convenience rather than economic fundamentals. Once reserves are depleted, this approach has led to abrupt and disruptive corrections consistently undermining rather than enhancing export potential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it is incredibly important to have a competitive exchange rate as it improves export margins, encourages investment in tradable goods, and signals the viability of producing for global markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History shows that prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax on exports and a subsidy to imports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, rate alone is insufficient; credibility is equally essential. Exporters are willing to invest and scale up operations only if they trust that relative prices will remain broadly aligned with fundamentals over time. In Pakistan’s case, this trust has been repeatedly eroded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Musharraf era&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Musharraf administration, the rupee was kept stable at around Rs60 to the dollar throughout much of the 2000s. While this stability created an illusion of macroeconomic soundness, it concealed growing external imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the pressures finally surfaced, the adjustment was late and severe: from 2007 to 2009, the rupee dropped from roughly Rs60 to over Rs80 per dollar as reserves collapsed and an International Monetary Fund intervention became necessary. Exporters, who had operated under an overvalued currency, did not suddenly become competitive. Instead, they faced higher input costs, disrupted financing, and weakened financial positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stability over fundamentals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above pattern recurred between 2013 and 2017, with the rupee held between Rs100–105 per dollar despite widening current-account deficits and falling reserves. Exporters consistently warned about the currency’s overvaluation, but policy makers focused on maintaining price stability and political optics. When the inevitable adjustment occurred, it was abrupt and disorderly: the rupee’s value dropped sharply in mid-2017, followed by a larger correction after 2018, reaching around Rs160 per dollar by mid-2019. This sudden realignment destabilised firms and inflation expectations instead of supporting a smooth transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market distortions and eroding confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last three years have proven even more damaging. Administrative controls, delayed adjustments, and the emergence of multiple exchange rates pushed pressure into informal markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2023, the rupee experienced one of its steepest single-day falls, losing nearly 10 per cent within hours. Over the year, it depreciated by close to 30pc percent, at one point briefly approaching Rs300 per dollar before settling near Rs285 when administrative controls were introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These shifts coincided with harsh stabilisation measures such as import compression, punitive interest rates, higher energy prices, and increased taxes. Any potential export gains from depreciation were negated by rising costs and collapsing confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeatedly underminig exports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These episodes highlight a clear lesson: prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964797&quot;&gt;exports&lt;/a&gt; and a subsidy to imports. This encourages consumption and rent-seeking while discouraging investment in tradable sectors. When adjustment is finally forced, it comes as a crisis — too sudden and volatile to generate the intended export response. Exporters cannot recover lost markets overnight, nor can they invest amidst uncertainty and tightening financial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gradual adjustment and integrated policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful export economies do not rely on dramatic devaluations. Instead, they allow gradual, market-aligned adjustments, avoid prolonged misalignments, and resist using the exchange rate as a political tool. Effective currency policy is complemented by competitive energy pricing, predictable taxation, efficient logistics, and skills development, enabling exporters to respond to price signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Vietnam has pursued gradual adjustments that avoid prolonged overvaluation and limit volatility, giving exporters the confidence to invest and integrate into global value chains. Bangladesh has similarly adopted a steady crawl rather than crisis-driven devaluations, preserving export competitiveness and market share — a model Pakistan has repeatedly failed to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: toward a credible exchange rate policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s core issue is not deciding between a ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ rupee. Rather, it is the persistent belief that administrative controls can substitute for competitiveness. Until the exchange-rate policy reflects fundamentals on a sustained basis and is part of a broader, credible export strategy, depreciation will remain disruptive, and exports will continue to be vulnerable to future crises.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finance : A hard time for employment</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967694/finance-a-hard-time-for-employment</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Major international institutions project Pakistan’s GDP growth for the current fiscal year within a close range of three per cent to 3.6pc. However, this variation primarily reflects the timing of their assessments in relation to the 2025 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1940947&quot;&gt;monsoon floods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) forecast of 3.6pc was formulated in October 2025 and does not incorporate the impact of the subsequent floods. In contrast, the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) revised estimate of around 3.25pc and the World Bank’s projection of 3pc are later evaluations that explicitly account for the flood’s dampening effect on the economy, particularly the agricultural sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macroeconomic indicators for the first half of the year (July-December 2025) indicate that full-year growth would be somewhere between 3pc and 3.5pc in the best-case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this exceeds Pakistan’s population growth of roughly 2.6pc, it still risks constraining recent gains in per-capita income and employment creation. Poverty reduction and improved social mobility, and meaningful job creation may remain elusive even as macroeconomic indicators show short-term stabilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift, broad-based employment creation is imperative for national stability and resilience in the increasingly competitive regional and global arena&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much will also depend on the regional and domestic security environment, which remains fluid and difficult to forecast. Heightened tensions in the Middle East — particularly the risk of a limited or escalatory military confrontation involving the United States and Iran — could have indirect but significant repercussions for Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a scenario may disrupt global energy markets, raise oil prices, strain Pakistan’s import bill, and complicate external financing conditions at a time of fragile macroeconomic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963692&quot;&gt;Diplomatic&lt;/a&gt; pressures could also intensify, placing Pakistan in a delicate position as it seeks to balance strategic neutrality with economic and security interests, including the safety and operational continuity of its diplomatic missions in the region. Even without a full-scale conflict, prolonged uncertainty alone could dampen investor confidence, delay capital inflows, and further weaken prospects for job creation and sustained growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising domestic political polarisation is fraying social cohesion, and failure to create employment could intensify unrest. Pakistan simultaneously faces militancy, terrorism, and a volatile regional security environment, particularly as tensions escalate in the Middle East following the US-Iran imbroglio. In such circumstances, a stagnant labour market is not just an economic problem; it is a strategic vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture for 2026 is clear. Moderate GDP growth alone will not generate jobs. Automation, structural inefficiencies, informalisation, skill gaps, and demand suppression converge to constrain employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without bold policy interventions — including labour-intensive investment, workforce skill development, small and medium enterprise (SME) support, and education reform — Pakistan risks growth that is largely jobless, leaving both its workforce and national stability exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour-intensive sectors — historically engines of employment like construction, textiles, and agriculture — are no longer absorbing workers as they once did. Automation, mechanisation, and artificial intelligence adoption threaten jobs across industries, particularly in routine roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research from the Lahore University of Management Sciences Mahbub-ul-Haq Research Centre estimates that around 17 per cent of Pakistan’s workforce is at high risk of displacement due to technological adoption, with manufacturing, customer service, and portions of agriculture most exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s ready-made garment sector demonstrates the consequences of this “jobless growth” dynamic: automation has reportedly reduced workforce numbers by 30pc or more in some factories, even as output and exports surged, leaving lower-skilled workers displaced and incomes stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMEs, long &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1941128&quot;&gt;recognised&lt;/a&gt; as the backbone of Pakistan’s economy and employment, are under intense pressure. According to a joint Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority and International Labour Organisation study, Pakistan’s roughly 5.24 million SMEs account for a substantial portion of economic activity, yet many struggle to survive amid high compliance costs, limited access to formal finance, and regulatory burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates place the informal economy at 35–40pc of GDP, or approximately $457 billion, underscoring its critical role in sustaining livelihoods. Yet as documentation and regulatory demands rise, many small enterprises either shut down or operate outside the formal system, contributing to a “gigified” labour market of precarious, short-term, and underpaid work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public sector, a fallback for labour absorption in the good old days, too, cannot act as an employer of last resort. The FY25 federal budget froze hiring for BPS 1–16 positions, projected to save Rs45 billion annually, while rightsizing initiatives have eliminated thousands of redundant posts across ministries and attached departments and the ongoing privatisation of overstaffed and financially unviable state-owned enterprises, like the Utility Stores Corporation, also produces a new wave of joblessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal pressures and international reform conditionalities limit the government’s capacity to offset private-sector job shortfalls. This structural shift leaves the private sector, SMEs, and informal enterprises to shoulder the responsibility of employment creation, a burden made heavier by technological disruption and weak consumer demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even export growth, traditionally a key engine of employment in labour-intensive economies, is becoming less job-intensive. Pakistan’s textile and clothing sector (which accounts for 55–63pc of merchandise exports and roughly $16–18 billion in value) has shown modest growth in recent years. Yet employment in the sector has stagnated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh elections cannot be free and fair in absence of Awami League: Former Foreign minister</title>

      <description>Bangladesh&apos;s oldest party, Awami League, says that upcoming elections on February 12 will lack fairness. Leaders allege the Yunus regime banned them undemocratically. They accuse the UN Human Rights body of a biased report on past unrest. The party is documenting recent killings, including of Hindus, for international bodies.</description>

      <title>HISTORY: THE FORGOTTEN MASSACRE OF MULTAN</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967653/history-the-forgotten-massacre-of-multan</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media  sm:w-9/10  w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Illustration by Sarah Durrani&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/696c54dac8656.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 2, 1978, Gen Ziaul Haq’s regime ordered security forces to open fire at workers striking at Colony Textile Mills, Multan, allegedly killing 133 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No first information report (FIR) was registered, no civilian trial was held and, aside from a military inquiry whose contents were never shared, a public acknowledgement of this state atrocity has never been made. Instead, what remains is a carefully managed absence from Pakistani history books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragedy that occurred that cold winter afternoon in Multan was a direct response to industrial workers who had emerged as a major political force in 1970s Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the success of the 1969 students’ and workers’ movement that led to the overthrow of Gen Ayub Khan, leftist politics had strengthened demands for more equitable wealth distribution. During the Ayub dictatorship, state loans given to a small circle of elite industrialists had propped up development statistics but, as wealth disparity dramatically increased, Pakistan’s working class was pushed to economic desperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In January 1978, Gen Zia’s martial law regime mercilessly mowed down striking textile mill workers in the ‘City of Saints.’ Till today, the scale of the killings is disputed and no official account exists of what is widely considered the bloodiest massacre in Pakistan’s labour history…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ayub’s removal and the civil war in East Pakistan, which led to the creation of Bangladesh, forced President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to develop legislation for workers’ rights. In February 1972, his martial law government announced new labour laws for Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military, industrialists and even the politicians who had taken their votes were all alarmed at the strength of consolidated worker power. Bhutto’s labour laws, though flawed, dramatically increased the number of labour unions registered in the country and led to regular strike actions by worker groups over fair pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the new labour reforms only existed on paper. Mere months after they came into effect, on June 7, 1972, police killed at least three workers who were protesting against delayed wages by the owners of Feroz Sultan Textile Mills at SITE, Karachi. During one of the funeral processions, police opened fire again, leading to more deaths. Bhutto showed no sympathy, saying the strikers were being manipulated by anti-Pakistan elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Zia took over the country, his martial law framed labour unrest as a threat to public order. This was the most violent act by the state against labourers in Pakistani history — a systematic erasure that reveals the nexus of state-capital power under martial law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elite Capture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;media  sm:w-7/8  w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;

				&lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Commemorative slab at a graveyard in Frontier Colony in Karachi for labourers killed following protests in June 1972&lt;/figcaption&gt;
			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the massacre requires understanding who owned the mill — and their proximity to power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Colony Group, owners of Multan Colony Textile Mills, exemplified the industrial elite that had prospered under the Ayub regime. With its business primarily in textile manufacturing, this Chinioti/ Sheikh family group had been well-established before Partition and gained considerable strength due to limited competition in the nascent state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1961, the Colony Group was a part of the big five industrial houses, who each held over Rs50 million — a vast fortune by 1961 standards and equivalent to approximately Rs10 billion today, adjusted for an average annual inflation rate of 8.6 percent — in assets. As with the other industrial groups, it benefitted from the establishment of the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) in 1952.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naseer A. Sheikh, the eldest son of the group’s founder Mohammad Ismaeel, served on PIDC’s Board of Directors. Even after the conglomerate split into two, the Colony Naseer Group, which oversaw the mills, was the seventh richest company in Pakistan in 1970, according to economist Rashid Amjad, former vice chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after Bhutto started nationalisation in 1972, the Colony Naseer Group — despite losing Rs93.9 million or 49.5 percent of its assets — was the sixth richest industrial house in Pakistan. When the tragedy happened in 1978, 13,000 workers were employed at Colony Textile Mills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media Coverage and the State Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting on the events of January 2, 1978, was carefully managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) had been given a handout, and Dawn’s front page on January 3 carried the small headline “Five killed in Multan firing.” International papers reported similar figures, with The New York Times using a United Press International (UPI) wire, stating: “Five Killed and 10 Hurt As Pakistan Police Open Fire at Strikers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French publication Le Monde and British daily The Guardian carried the same number. The Times of India, however, reported on January 4 that “at least a dozen people were shot dead… The death toll may be 50.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, the APP report framed workers as unreasonable from its opening line, claiming they “refused to accept” a mutually agreed bonus and “proceeded on illegal strike” from December 29, 1977. The APP report of the incident stated that workers had demanded a bonus of four-and-a-half-months’ pay, which the Colony Group management refused, saying as it was “not commensurate with the margin of profit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The APP report continued that, on January 2, 1978, the labourers on strike became “unruly and rowdy and thousands of them encircled the police force and started brick-batting, resulting in injuries to eight of the policemen, including one ASI [assistant sub-inspector] and one head constable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report concluded that the police had to react in self-defence against a crowd that could not be managed and had turned violent. “The police was ordered to lathi-charge [baton-charge], which they did, and teargas was also used to disperse the unruly mob.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inquiry and Discipline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Memorial for slain labourers, with their graves painted red at Frontier Colony, Karachi | Photos courtesy Piler&lt;/figcaption&gt;
			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following days, swift administrative action was reported. The mill management announced compensation for the deceased and, within two days of the massacre, the martial law administrator (MLA) for Punjab suspended Multan’s senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chaudhry Niamatullah, assistant commissioner (AC) Jam Jan Mohammad, and the area’s station house officer (SHO), Raja Khizar Hayat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A three-member inquiry committee was also established, with Brig S.M. Ilyas, Col Naeem and Magistrate Sardar Alam, who were going to record “in camera” witness statements. A statement was also taken from Mughis Sheikh, Naseer’s younger brother, who managed the mill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 6, 1978, an “official clarification” was issued, in which the commissioner of Multan Division verified that those killed at Colony Textile Mills “are not more than 14.” This clarification also stated that the number of dead included those whose families had taken them to their villages, instead of the city hospital, “which resulted in their ultimate deaths, as they could not get proper medical aid” — a claim that appeared to shift blame from the shooting to delayed medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it reported that the administration claimed it did not bury any bodies, with all of them handed over to their families — a claim later contradicted by witness testimonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Dawn, in a restrained editorial titled ‘A tragedy in Multan’, could only express that, “It is extremely sad that this major clash should have taken place in the days of a Martial Law regime dedicated to the revival of democratic rule and social harmony.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merely 13 days after the massacre, on January 15, martial law (ML) authorities ordered workers to return — framing it as an ‘appeal’. Maj Gen Ejaz Azim, Multan’s deputy MLA, along with other officials, visited the factory and claimed that 92 percent of workers were present and the mills were functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With attention having rapidly shifted to restoring production, workers were promised a bonus equivalent to three months of basic pay on February 1 and recreation allowance on May 1. However, workers were denied pay for the days they were on strike, from December 29 to January 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ML administrators were now regularly visiting the factory and, on January 21, Maj Gen Azim addressed workers that Gen Zia himself had expressed “heartfelt sympathies” and gave “assurance that justice will be done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEYOND THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet what the martial law administration allowed in reporting differed drastically from what those on the ground — and researchers documenting Gen Zia-era abuses — have recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gen Zia was close to the Sheikh family, having served as Corps Commander Multan right before his appointment as chief of army staff. He had arrived in Multan on January 2 to attend the wedding of Mughis Sheikh’s daughter. Workers reported hearing that the bride’s dowry was 10 times the amount of the bonuses they had demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Hassan Gardezi and Jamil Rashid in Pakistan: The Roots of Dictatorship, workers had occupied the factory floor since December 29, when the strike started, preventing a lockout by the mill management. Aslam Khwaja in People’s Movement in Pakistan writes that, during the afternoon shift-change on the day of the tragedy on January 2, when workers gathered at the gate for a union meeting, police asked them to end the “illegal” strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, during the wedding, Gen Zia was allegedly told that workers — having heard of his presence — had gathered in their thousands and were marching towards the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What followed next remains shrouded in mystery, even after 48 years: large numbers killed with over 400 injured as, according to news accounts, police opened fire. Those involved in the strike and affected by the incident vehemently argue that Gen Zia ordered troops to open fire on the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mystery also surrounds the number of casualties, with figures varying drastically — from state-reported counts of 14 deaths to union claims exceeding 200. The most widely-accepted figure among researchers and labour activists is 133, collated by the Mazdoor Action Committee, which was formed by local labour organisers in the wake of the massacre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to political activist and theorist Lal Khan, those desperately trying to escape the bullets were crushed in the ensuing stampede. When the firing began, workers’ families who lived within the mill’s residential compound came outside to get the bodies of their loved ones, but were prevented from retrieving them by law enforcement. The firing continued for three hours; by six in the evening, law enforcement had seized control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burial site for such a large number also remains disputed, with testimonies suggesting that some victims were still alive when thrown among the dead. Testimonies available today mention two possible locations: one, a sewage drain where bodies were dumped by tractor; another, a hastily dug ditch. Multiple people in Multan, speaking to Eos on condition of anonymity, said that the bodies were buried so badly that scavenger animals picked at limbs protruding from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath and Denial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after the tragedy, the United States Department of State lauded Gen Zia for his human rights record, particularly with reference to arbitrary arrests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a report issued even a year after the tragedy, the US state department made no mention of the massacre. Instead, it reported that “The labour movement in Pakistan is limited by the relatively small size of the industrial sector.” The report acknowledged that “Martial Law regulations currently prohibit both strikes and political activity by unions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, accounts of the true scale of the violence, contradicting the state narrative, had emerged from Multan. Urdu dailies Imroze and Mussawat had reported the firing, and the editor of Imroze Multan, Masood Ashar, was transferred to Lahore. The Karachi Workers Coordination Committee (KWCC) observed a week of mourning, and also announced that a fact-finding delegation was being sent to Multan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Punjab chapter of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) separately announced the formation of a five-member fact-finding committee. Labour unions across Pakistan — including the Muttahida Mazdoor Federation, the National Labour Federation and others — demanded a judicial inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalist organisations also condemned the suppression of accurate reporting. Separately, a meeting of journalists at the Karachi Press Club on January 8 asked for a new inquiry over the police firing at workers in SITE in June 1972, which they suspected was also a cover-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, ML administrators were adamant that knowledge of the event be suppressed. Intensifying pressure on workers at the textile mill, on March 12, a summary military court of Multan sentenced three labour leaders for organising a strike on February 16. Wasl Mohammad received one-and-a-half years of rigorous imprisonment (RI) and 15 lashes. Amir Ali and Abdul Khaliq received nine months RI and seven lashes and one year RI and 10 lashes respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the scale of the violence, the state’s grip on affairs in Pakistan was such that no FIR was filed. Outside of the military inquiry, whose contents were never shared publicly, no official account exists. The government has never articulated what exactly happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state has never accepted that the massacre took place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the 1972 killings of labourers in Karachi have some recognition. The Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research (Piler) erected a memorial in Frontier Colony, Karachi, and the graves of the slain workers are painted red. At Colony Textile Mills, Multan, no memorial exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cruelty of denial is still starkly present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mughis Sheikh died in 2024 and former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani paid condolences to the family. Meanwhile, workers from January 2, 1978, still await justice and recognition. Yet on Pakistan’s 75th independence anniversary in 2022 , Punjab’s Labour and Human Resource Department awarded Colony Textile Mills a “Best Employer Award.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows that, to this day, state and elite interests remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a way to dispel this notion: by making public the sealed military inquiry and convening an independent investigation to finally establish what really transpired that day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SMOKERS’ CORNER: DOCTRINE DIORAMAS</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967648/smokers-corner-doctrine-dioramas</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the theatre of global politics, a ‘doctrine’ is more than just a policy paper. It is a nation’s strategic DNA. From the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, which fenced off the western hemisphere from European monarchs, to the 1947 Truman Doctrine that looked to aggressively ‘contain’ Soviet communism, these blueprints signal a country’s core values, and the consequences for those who cross them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1968, the Soviet Union introduced the Brezhnev Doctrine, asserting Moscow’s right to militarily intervene in socialist countries being threatened by capitalist/pro-US forces. Fast forward to the 21st century, and the blueprints have become increasingly aggressive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen the Bush Doctrine’s ‘strike first, ask questions later’ approach (‘preemptive strikes’), and Russia’s Gerasimov Doctrine, which treats disinformation and cyberattacks as the new artillery. We see the Xi Jinping Doctrine seeking to enhance China’s glory through the sprawling veins of the Belt and Road Initiative, while Donald Trump’s recent ‘Donroe’ Doctrine is an obsession with border walls, drug cartels and keeping Chinese influence out of ‘America’s backyard.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But doctrines are not static. They mutate. They adapt to the scent of power and economic reality. This is apparent in Pakistan as well. Pakistan began with its founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s high-minded idealism, but was quickly forced into a security-first straitjacket by the shadow of a much larger India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s national ‘doctrine’ has continued to mutate according to the whims of those in power, thus resulting in an often erratic and haphazard approach to strategy-building&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1958, the harsh realities of the Cold War had taken hold. Upon seizing power, Gen Ayub Khan established a doctrine that firmly anchored Pakistan within Western alliances. This manoeuvre was shaped to leverage US military and economic assistance to balance the scales with India, while simultaneously energising an ambitious industrialisation and modernisation programme at home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ayub regime fell in 1969. Under another dictator, Gen Yahya Khan, the country’s eastern wing broke away in 1971 to become Bangladesh. Rising to power in the wake of the 1971 crisis, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whose party had secured a majority in the country’s western wing during the 1970 elections, began to forge a new national path. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bhutto’s doctrine was designed to reinvent Pakistan’s identity and champion a strategy that moved away from heavy Western dependency in favour of stronger ties with oil-rich Arab states, the ‘Islamic Bloc’, and the burgeoning ‘Third World’ movement. Most significantly, the doctrine established the groundwork for Pakistan’s nuclear programme, which Bhutto envisioned as the essential equaliser to offset India’s military strength. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bhutto’s regime fell in a military coup in 1977. The coup-maker, Gen Ziaul Haq decided to stay on. A Zia Doctrine emerged. It prioritised a policy of domestic ‘Islamisation’, while positioning Pakistan as a frontline state in a US-backed anti-Soviet ‘Afghan jihad.’ Consequently, the Zia dictatorship secured extensive American support, which Zia used as a cover to accelerate the country’s nuclear programme under a cloak of plausible deniability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;media  sm:w-2/3  w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/696c4e913400c.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
				
			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this era, the concept of ‘strategic depth’ also took root. This strategy sought to establish a pro-Pakistan government in Afghanistan, to ensure a secure territory where Pakistani armed forces could regroup in the event of conflict with India. Following Zia’s death in a 1988 plane crash, the Zia Doctrine remained a powerful influence over Pakistan’s foreign and domestic policies throughout the turbulent ‘decade of democracy’ that followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1999, the political landscape shifted again when Gen Pervez Musharraf seized power in a coup. Now there was a Musharraf Doctrine. It was fundamentally defined by the global upheaval of the 9/11 attacks. Adopting a ‘Pakistan first’ mantra, Musharraf attempted to balance a high-stakes role as a key US ally in the ‘War on Terror’ with a domestic social vision known as ‘enlightened moderation.’ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the doctrine ultimately collapsed as the country faced the dual pressures of surging Islamist militancy and widespread internal unrest. From 2008 onward, a ‘hybrid system’ began to take shape, creating a political mechanism through which civilian governments were elected to office but remained tethered to strategic doctrines drafted by the military leadership. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A landmark shift occurred in 2013, with the emergence of the Raheel Sharif Doctrine, authored by the-then army chief. This doctrine represented a fundamental departure from traditional thinking by officially acknowledging that internal militancy posed a far greater existential threat to Pakistan than its historical rivalry with India. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift was swiftly operationalised through a massive military offensive launched to dismantle Islamist sanctuaries and neutralise militant networks. Then, a Bajwa Doctrine surfaced during the tenure of Imran Khan, marking an attempt by former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa to once again alter Pakistan’s national security focus. The core of this doctrine was a shift toward geo-economics, prioritising regional trade, transit and the infrastructure connectivity promised by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this vision ultimately fractured under the weight of mounting civil-military discord. While the military leadership sought regional stability to facilitate economic growth, the Khan administration remained preoccupied with an aggressive campaign against political rivals and a polarising effort to ‘rehabilitate’ Islamist militants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divergence in priorities, exacerbated by the stagnation of key CPEC projects, strained the working relationship between Khan and Bajwa. The resulting deadlock concluded in 2022, with Khan’s removal from office through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appointed as Bajwa’s successor by a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led coalition, Gen Asim Munir oversaw the emergence of what is often referred to as the ‘Munir Model.’ Its outcome is perhaps the most rooted institutionalisation of military authority in Pakistan’s history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its heart lies the concept of economic sovereignty, a framework where the military has moved to take a more active role in steering the nation’s economics. Strategically, the model is defined by a ‘zero-tolerance’ posture, as it maintains a relentless, uncompromising stance against Islamist militants and Baloch separatists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model views internal security and economic stability as two sides of the same coin. By fusing state survival with economic growth and military muscle, the doctrine aims to project Pakistan as an assertive regional power. Geopolitically, the Munir Model is characterised by an intense anti-India tilt. It is deeply pro-China, and closely aligned with Saudi Arabia, while maintaining a pragmatic engagement with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, the model identifies political populism as an existential threat to the state’s functional integrity. Notably, the doctrine seeks to trim the Islamist dimension from Pakistani nationalism that was added by the Zia Doctrine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Munir’s doctrine remains rooted in Pakistani nationalism, it replaces Islamist fervour with a brand of ‘rational Islam’ and hard-nosed pragmatism. The model has been a success on many fronts, but it will continue to be tested in an increasingly turbulent and mutating geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Basmati boom propels Pakistan past Vietnam</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967625/basmati-boom-propels-pakistan-past-vietnam</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Pakistan’s rice exports recorded a strong rebound in December 2025, registering a 14 per cent month-on-month (MoM) increase compared to November, primarily driven by a more than 50pc surge in Basmati shipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impressive performance enabled Pakistan to overtake Vietnam and emerge as the world’s third-largest rice exporter, behind India and Thailand, during the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to trade data, Pakistan exported 489,000 tonnes of rice in December 2025, excluding shipments to Iran, compared to Vietnam’s 387,000 tonnes. This marks Pakistan’s best monthly rice export performance, underscoring renewed momentum in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE remained the top destination for Pakistani rice, importing 74,897 tonnes, including 16,850 tonnes of Basmati. China followed closely with 74,685 tonnes, while other major destinations included Tanzania (62,900 tonnes), Kenya (60,300 tonnes), Ivory Coast (41,700 tonnes), Guinea-Bissau (31,850 tonnes), Malaysia (23,930 tonnes), Madagascar (17,800 tonnes), Kazakhstan (17,050 tonnes), Saudi Arabia (16,032 tonnes, including 5,350 tonnes of Basmati), the EU and UK combined (21,100 tonnes, including 15,600 tonnes of Basmati), Oman (5,770 tonnes), the United States (2,230 tonnes), and Canada (1,321 tonnes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;December surge boosts rankings despite structural challenges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable development during December was Pakistan’s growing footprint in Central Asian markets. Exports to Kazakhstan exceeded 17,000 tonnes, including 10,300 tonnes of Basmati, while shipments to Uzbekistan stood at 10,382 tonnes. Industry experts say this reflects a structural shift, as Pakistan is now exporting directly to Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Previously, much of this trade moved indirectly through Afghanistan, but the closure of the Afghan border has prompted direct export routes, making Pakistan’s presence in the region more visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the encouraging December figures, the rice export sector continues to face deep-rooted challenges. Structural, financial, marketing, and capacity-related weaknesses persist, with one of the most significant gaps being Pakistan’s negligible exports to Iraq — currently the world’s second-largest importer of Indian Basmati rice after Saudi Arabia. Similarly, Pakistan’s exports to Turkiye, a key transit hub for Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and parts of Eastern Europe, remain minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has recently directed authorities to formulate a comprehensive strategy to boost rice exports and reduce the widening trade deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government officials have attributed the downturn to low-priced Indian rice and phytosanitary rejections at borders. However, exporters argue that Pakistan’s rice sector is suffering primarily due to policy missteps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamid Malik, a rice sector analyst, says the causes include intense global competition, higher global production — especially in India — weakening international demand, rising ocean freight and logistics costs, inconsistent fiscal and monetary policies, irrational regulatory frameworks, inflated domestic prices caused by hoarding and undocumented money, and security-related border closures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these challenges, Malik sees several positive developments as a silver lining. “There is strong demand for Pakistani rice in Bangladesh, although higher freight costs have eroded competitiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central Asian states are also emerging as promising markets since the start of Pakistan’s harvesting season in October 2025. Additionally, a 50pc tariff imposed by the United States on Indian rice exports has begun to benefit Pakistan, with shipments to the US gradually picking up, says Abu Bakr, an exporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant development is unfolding in Iran, where foreign exchange shortages have led the Iranian Central Bank to stop issuing subsidised foreign exchange for rice imports. Iranian traders are now importing rice using their own funds, a shift that has favoured Pakistan due to geographic proximity. Pakistani exporters report a surge in Iranian demand, while Indian exporters have been adversely affected.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Talk of Gen Z bringing about change in the world is quite overrated, moot told</title>

				&lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Dr S. Akbar Zaidi speaks as Dr Masuma Hasan, Dr Kaiser Bengali and Dr Muhammad Abid Rao look on.—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star&lt;/figcaption&gt;
			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KARACHI: Strains on the global economy, the uprising of Generation Z and its growing impact, as well as issues of war, deterrence and escalation in the world largely shaped 2025 as the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs (PIIA) reviewed the state of global politics on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chairperson of PIIA, diplomat and scholar Dr Masuma Hasan reminded how the past year was full of conflicts, the worst of which was in Gaza. “There was also Sudan where 12 million Sudanese left their own country, there was the Ukraine war, strikes on Iran, while in Haiti, criminal gangs ruled the country. Also, there was the crisis in Venezuela where the president was kidnapped by the United States of America. And in between there were tensions between the US and China and the US and the European Union. Still, the Gaza genocide overshadowed all other conflicts,” said Dr Hasan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economist Dr Kaiser Bengali also said that the turbulence created by  the US in 2025 is not likely to go away. He also said that talk of  Generation Z bringing about change in the world is quite overrated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every  generation is different from the previous generation. And every  previous generation has contributed something or the other to the world.  So to say that this is the generation that is going to change the world  is not correct as the world has also been changing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;State of global politics reviewed in PIIA seminar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The  Gen Z revolts that have been taking place have not delivered anything.  The spring revolutions that came did not deliver anything and ultimately  the status quo came back, though maybe with different faces and  different names,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In Bangladesh, nothing will  change. The same elite is going to run the country. The only change that  has happened is in Sri Lanka where a Leftist party has come into power.  Otherwise, Sri Lanka has always been ruled by one or two families. In  Pakistan, we overthrew Ayub Khan, we overthrew Musharraf through mass  protests but then we found that we were still where we began. No change.  So I think that this entire Gen Z thing and its revolt is overrated  because change never comes by mobs on the street. In Iran, too, the  protests are already dying down and the Ayatollah will continue to rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You  need to have an organised resistance. Until and unless there is  organised resistance you cannot sustain your movement and bring about  the changes that you want to bring. And the thing about organised  movement is that you need to organise around a strategy,” Dr Bengali  explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘We are living in the era and aura of Trump’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economist and Executive Director of the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) Dr S. Akbar Zaidi added to that by saying that “We are living in the era and aura of the US President Donald Trump. His is a muscular government,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are especially two instances under the current US President that have shown the military might and the precision of the military might of the US that we had not seen for many decades,” said Dr Zaidi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Earlier, there had been many attempts by the US government to intervene to change governments but two things that they did in the last seven months show the precision and military science of the US Army that has Donald Trump as its commander-in-chief. One was about Iran, where the planes flew from the middle of the United States to bomb where Iran’s nuclear facilities were supposed to be. And another thing was the recent kidnapping of Maduro, the president of Venezuela. It was a raid, not an invasion,” he pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This has been written about as a lurch to the past, a new kind of imperialism. It is a resource imperialism. It is interesting to see that unlike Iraq or Libya and other places where the mantra was democracy or regime change, in the case of Venezuela it is nothing of the sort. Trump has said that he now runs Venezuela. And it is all for and about oil. It is no longer about democracy or regime change, it is about power and natural resources. The US national defence strategy of 2025 under Trump says that ‘the United States cannot allow any nation to become so dominant that it could threaten our interests’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, speaking about war, deterrence and escalation in the world, Air Vice Marshal Dr Muhammad Abid Rao, who is a member of the research faculty of the PAF Air War College, said that in America, their economy is largely based on the sale of weapons. Therefore, it is very important for America to have a war at any given time in different parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you see from 1945, America came and settled in Europe and the Pacific region and till today they have not vacated those bases, be it UK, Belgium, Holland or Germany. France is the only country there which did not allow the Americans to make a base there. If you see the Pacific to the Philippines, to Japan to Thailand and so many other islands, you will find American bases there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They had missed out on the Middle East. So in 1990, America prompted Iraq to take over Kuwait. That gave America an excuse to have the first Gulf War. So they attacked and destroyed Iraq and made bases there. Today, they have bases in Oman, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia. Iraq is wiped out, so is Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let me take you back to the Arab-Israel war of 1973. There were moments in that October war when Israel would have collapsed had the Americans not warned them about the Egyptian surprise attack. Israel and America then formulated the policy that any country who has the potential or capability to threaten Israel should be neutralised,” the Air Vice Marshal explained.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh meet with ICC to request relocation of T20 World Cup matches</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967503/bangladesh-meet-with-icc-to-request-relocation-of-t20-world-cup-matches</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has had “constructive” discussions with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over moving their Twenty20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka, the country’s governing body said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty looms over Bangladesh’s participation in the Twenty20 World Cup following an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;earlier request&lt;/a&gt; by the BCB to the ICC to move their World Cup matches out of India over safety concerns amid political tensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCB and ICC officials met in Dhaka on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the discussions, the BCB reiterated its formal request to the ICC to relocate Bangladesh’s matches to Sri Lanka,” the BCB said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board also shared the Bangladesh government’s views and concerns on safety and security of the team, Bangladeshi fans, media and other stakeholders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh are in World Cup’s Group C and will play West Indies, England and Italy in Kolkata before facing Nepal in Mumbai. The tournament will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions have heightened in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962902&quot;&gt;recent weeks&lt;/a&gt; between Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds protested near Bangladesh’s High Commission in New Delhi last month after a Hindu factory worker was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808#:~:text=lynching%20of%20a%20Hindu%20man%20over%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy.&quot;&gt;beaten and set on fire&lt;/a&gt; in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district over blasphemy allegations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>U-19 World Cup: No handshake between India and Bangladesh at toss but players shake hands after game</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967495/u-19-world-cup-no-handshake-between-india-and-bangladesh-at-toss-but-players-shake-hands-after-game</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The captains of India and Bangladesh skipped the customary handshake during the toss of their U-19 World Cup match but the two sides did shake hands at the end of the game, which the former won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the toss, Bangladesh’s acting captain Zawad Abrar and India’s captain Ayush Mhatre did not do the customary handshake at the pre-match toss, which the former won.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StarSportsIndia/status/2012439350018252870&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were, however, handshakes between the teams at the end of the game, which India won by 18 runs (DLS method),” &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/india-vs-bangladesh-no-handshakes-at-toss-but-players-shake-hands-after-game-1519897&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESPN Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also quoted a statement from the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) as saying that the “absence of a handshake with the opposition captain was completely unintentional and resulted from a momentary lapse in concentration”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was no intent whatsoever to show discourtesy or disregard towards the opposition,” the report quoted the BCB as saying in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board has viewed the matter with due seriousness, as upholding the spirit of cricket and respect for opponents is a fundamental prerequisite for representing Bangladesh at any level and immediately advised the team management accordingly,” the BCB was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The players have also been reminded of their responsibility to maintain the highest standards of sportsmanship, camaraderie and mutual respect in all interactions with opposing teams,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that Indian cricketers had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942082&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts during last year’s Asia Cup matches, in the aftermath of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials&quot;&gt;military conflict&lt;/a&gt; between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s development comes as Bangladesh has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it will not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has played in the IPL for other teams in previous editions, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million. His sacking sparked fury in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the International Cricket Council to shift their games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, during a video conference with the ICC, the BCB &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966813&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it had “reiterated its request for the ICC to consider relocating Bangladesh’s matches outside India”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations between India and Bangladesh had soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808#:~:text=lynching%20of%20a%20Hindu%20man%20over%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy.&quot;&gt;hostility&lt;/a&gt; against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Vihaan Malhotra&apos;s brilliant 4/14 spell triggered a dramatic Bangladesh collapse, securing an 18-run DLS victory for India in a rain-hit Under 19 World Cup match. Despite a strong start in their chase, Bangladesh faltered against Malhotra&apos;s spin, falling short of the revised target. Earlier, Kundu and Sooryavanshi anchored India&apos;s innings.</description>

      <title>No handshake between India, Bangladesh at toss during U-19 World Cup match</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tensions between India and Bangladesh were apparent on Saturday as the two sides skipped the customary handshake between the captains during the toss of a U-19 World Cup match in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s acting captain Zawad Abrar and India’s captain Ayush Mhatre did not do the customary handshake at the pre-match toss, which the former won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that Indian cricketers had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942082&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts during last year’s Asia Cup matches, in the aftermath of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials&quot;&gt;military conflict&lt;/a&gt; between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s development comes as Bangladesh has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it will not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has played in the IPL for other teams in previous editions, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million. His sacking sparked fury in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the International Cricket Council to shift their games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, during a video conference with the ICC, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966813&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it had “reiterated its request for the ICC to consider relocating Bangladesh’s matches outside India”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations between India and Bangladesh had soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808#:~:text=lynching%20of%20a%20Hindu%20man%20over%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy.&quot;&gt;hostility&lt;/a&gt; against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s domestically assembled JF-17 Thunder fighter jet, and its performance against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/india&quot;&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, have been at the centre of an ambitious drive to expand defence exports.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the oil-rich Gulf to North Africa and Southeast Asia, Islamabad is marketing the multi-role aircraft as a combat-tested, lower-cost alternative to western platforms, targeting countries constrained by budget limitations or wary of the political conditions that accompany major arms deals with the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s sales pitch was buoyed after a four-day air confrontation with India in May 2025, which Pakistani officials cite as a real-world demonstration of the country’s integrated air-combat capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the military balance sheet of the clash remains contested, Islamabad has seized on the episode to recast the JF-17 as not only affordable but operationally credible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JF-17 Thunder Block III is a single-engine, fourth-generation fighter jointly developed by the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and assembled in Pakistan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Chinese-made Pakistani fighter jet shot down at least one French Rafale&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/chinese-made-pakistani-fighter-jet-shot-down-least-one-rafale-jet&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long promoted as a budget-friendly option for smaller air forces, the aircraft is now being presented by Pakistani officials as a frontline platform capable of operating in high-intensity conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts believe interest has risen across the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Eurasia, as geopolitical realignments prompt states to look beyond traditional western suppliers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concrete details of potential contracts remain closely guarded, however, with most information emerging through unnamed official sources rather than signed agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raza Hayat Hiraj, Pakistan’s minister for defence production, told BBC Urdu this week that talks were &quot;underway&quot; with several countries for the sale of the JF-17, declining to name them and describing the negotiations as involving “protected secrets”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Combat as credentials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The export drive gained momentum after the four-day confrontation with India, the most intense exchange between the two air forces in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precise balance of losses remains contested, but Islamabad has highlighted one symbolic claim in particular: that Pakistani aircraft brought down at least one of India’s French-made advanced Rafale fighters. New Delhi has neither confirmed nor denied the assertion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the engagement altered the strategic equation, it achieved something just as valuable in the arms trade: it gave Pakistan a narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;The JF-17 is no longer just a budget option, but a battle-tested one&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-&amp;nbsp;Muhammad Shoaib,&amp;nbsp;Quaid-i-Azam University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, Pakistan struggled to move the JF-17 beyond its reputation as a “budget” alternative to western jets, but the skirmish with India changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Pakistan Air Force demonstrated superior performance against more expensive western platforms, including French-made Rafales,” Muhammad Shoaib, assistant professor at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, told Middle East Eye. “This proved the JF-17 is no longer just a budget option, but a battle-tested one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also noted that, unlike western systems, the JF-17 is exempt from the “political vetoes” and usage restrictions typically attached to American or European exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That message has been amplified by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly praised Pakistani aviation performance while taking credit for the subsequent ceasefire - a claim that New Delhi flatly denies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such endorsements are unusual in US-Pakistan relations, which have long been defined by mutual mistrust.&amp;nbsp;But for Pakistani defence marketers, they have become a powerful tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some analysts say the recent foreign interest is driven less by the aircraft itself and more by the perceived performance of the Pakistan Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Countries looking to make deals are impressed by the PAF after its performance in the May conflict with India and the combat learning and training derived from it,” Abdul Basit, senior associate fellow at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told MEE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In return, they are more inclined to purchase the JF-17.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Africa as a testing ground&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has already exported the JF-17 to Azerbaijan, Myanmar, and Nigeria.&amp;nbsp;Indonesia’s defence minister recently met Pakistan’s air force chief to discuss the possible purchase of the JF-17 and other defence products.&amp;nbsp;In Bangladesh, the political upheaval that followed the 2024 ousting of Sheikh Hasina has opened space for a recalibration of defence ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iraq&quot;&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistani military diplomacy has intensified after a high-level visit by the air force chief to Baghdad in January, with Iraqi officials expressing “keen interest” in both the JF-17 and Pakistan’s Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, Pakistani &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/2009908165115351244&quot;&gt;state-run PTV reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the strategy is yielding its most tangible dividends in Africa, a continent where great-power rivalry, internal conflicts, and expanding arms markets increasingly intersect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Pakistan on verge of $1.5bn deal to provide weapons and jets to Sudan&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pakistan-verge-sealing-15bn-deal-provide-weapons-and-jets-sudan&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/sudan&quot;&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/libya&quot;&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;, however, mark a qualitative shift: from limited sales to politically consequential defence partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Sudan, Pakistani officials told Reuters that negotiations are advanced on a defence package valued at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pakistan-verge-sealing-15bn-deal-provide-weapons-and-jets-sudan&quot;&gt;about $1.5&lt;/a&gt;bn that would include JF-17 Block III fighters, K-8 attack aircraft, and more than 200 drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal would bolster the Sudanese army, backed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/saudi-arabia&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, in its war against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which are supported by the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libya offers an even starker illustration of the trend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December, Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal General Asim Munir, travelled to Benghazi to meet General Khalifa Haftar, commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), which controls much of the country’s east and south.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit reportedly culminated in a defence agreement valued at more than $4bn, the largest arms export deal in Pakistan’s history, covering JF-17 fighters, Super Mushshak trainers and a range of naval and ground systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although arms transfers to Libya remain politically sensitive under the United Nations embargo framework, Haftar described the agreement as the beginning of a “new phase of strategic military cooperation” with Pakistan, language that reflects how arms deals are increasingly framed as security partnerships rather than simple transactions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dozen JF-17s would give the LNA a “game-changing advantage in air power” over the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, which is backed by Turkey, according to a Forbes analysis published in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts also warned that such deals illustrate Pakistan’s growing willingness to operate in politically complex theatres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These agreements embed Islamabad more deeply in African security calculations,” a western defence official based in Islamabad told MEE. “They also place Pakistan squarely within the competitive space between Gulf powers, China, and, increasingly, Russia and Turkey.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Saudi recalibration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most striking sign of Pakistan’s changing role is emerging in its relationship with Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;This is essentially about&amp;nbsp;[Saudi Arabia] supporting Pakistan and building a strategic hedge&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Ayesha Siddiqa,&amp;nbsp;Pakistani defence analyst&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a development signalling a significant shift in regional defence architecture, Islamabad and Riyadh have signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement. Following a destabilising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel&quot;&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; strike on Doha in September, the pact commits both nations to treat an attack on one as aggression against both.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talks have since shifted toward operationalising this alliance through a major procurement package. A recent Reuters report, citing Pakistani sources, suggests both sides are discussing converting $2bn of Saudi sovereign loans into an order for JF-17 fighter jets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Pakistan’s foreign ministry maintains it is “unaware” of a formal deal, high-level diplomatic activity suggests serious intent. Pakistan’s air chief recently travelled to Riyadh to meet Lieutenant General Turki bin Bandar bin Abdulaziz, commander of the Royal Saudi Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia’s air force remains heavily dependent on western hardware, including F-15s and the Thaad missile defence system. Even with Washington approving F-35 stealth aircraft sales to the kingdom, Riyadh’s interest in Pakistani platforms appears driven more by strategic calculation than tactical necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Saudi Arabia already has top-of-the-line aircraft; it does not really need the JF-17,” said Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani defence analyst. “This is essentially about supporting Pakistan and building a strategic hedge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She cautioned, however, that while the proposal has generated enthusiasm in Pakistan, concrete details remain limited and official confirmation is still pending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emerging “hedge” reflects the gradual erosion of confidence in the US-Saudi security paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riyadh’s trust was shaken by the muted American response to the 2019 Houthi attacks on oil facilities, the 2021 withdrawal of US missile defences, and the scaling back of support for Saudi operations in Yemen, according to an October analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Pakistan, with its nuclear deterrent, professional military, and deep ties to China, suddenly appears less like a junior partner and more like a strategic hedge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish officials have hinted that Ankara is in “advanced” discussions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-advanced-talks-join-saudi-arabia-and-pakistan-defence-pact-report&quot;&gt;join the framework&lt;/a&gt;, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, a sign of what analysts describe as a broader recalibration of regional security alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The elephant in the room: China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet behind every JF-17 export discussion looms a larger presence: China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aircraft may carry a Pakistani flag on its tail, but nearly half its components - especially critical avionics and radar systems - are manufactured in China. Any export deal requires Beijing’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials acknowledge this openly. “Some components of the JF-17 are manufactured in China, while others are produced in Pakistan,” Defence Production Minister Hiraj told BBC Urdu. “Consequently, China will be a party to any agreement we enter into with third parties.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basit characterises China as the “dominant partner” in the relationship, pointing to Beijing’s grip on core technologies and its control over production scaling. Consequently, any surge in global sales demands more than just industrial growth; it requires delicate diplomatic synchronicity with Beijing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, analyst Shoaib notes a strategic advantage for Beijing: many nations desire Chinese hardware but prefer the “Pakistani buffer” to avoid the direct diplomatic friction or “western anger” that comes with buying directly from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Economics and capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, the stakes are not only strategic but existentially economic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country is currently under its twenty-fourth International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, a $7bn arrangement that followed a last-minute bailout in 2023.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies helped stabilise the economy with deposit rollovers and emergency financing. Now, defence exports are being cast as a pathway out of a permanent crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-arabia-and-pakistan-talks-swap-loans-jf-17-warplanes-report&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;alt&quot; class=&quot;mee-readmore-image&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Pakistan-Saudi-Arabia-leaders-AFP.jpg.webp?itok=YVd7WU5q&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s defence minister, Khawaja Asif, has recently claimed that the scale of potential orders could one day free Pakistan from reliance on the IMF, a bold assertion that is not yet grounded in economic reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts say arms exports alone cannot resolve Pakistan’s structural economic problems, but they could provide a rare source of high-value foreign exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even a handful of major contracts would have a meaningful impact on Pakistan’s balance of payments,” an Islamabad-based economist at a multinational firm told MEE, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. “But the risk is that expectations are being raised faster than delivery capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has already established a symbolic export record with the JF-17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myanmar first ordered 16 aircraft in 2015, followed by Nigeria’s induction in 2021. Azerbaijan became the flagship customer, signing a landmark $1.6bn deal in 2024 for 16 jets, later expanded to 40. By late 2025, Baku formally inducted its first batch of Block III fighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet serious questions remain about Pakistan’s industrial capacity to meet ambitious export targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“France produces only about 25 or 26 Rafale jets a year,” Basit said. “How can Pakistan realistically manufacture far more JF-17s if multiple orders materialise?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He warned that Islamabad should exercise caution before committing to large-scale deals it may struggle to fulfil, particularly at a time when India is expanding its own air-combat inventory with additional Rafale purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In such a situation, Pakistan must also keep a close eye on its own stock of JF-17s,” he said, arguing that export enthusiasm should not come at the expense of domestic force readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ousting in August 2024, Bangladesh has emerged as a test case for democratic transition and regional power politics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In February 2026 Bangladesh will revert to democratic rule following elections and a referendum on the July charter. The new government will face a plethora of challenges, including reviving the economy, addressing demographic pressures, and healing the divides caused by the previous regime. There is also potential for renewed social unrest if voters perceive a return to business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relations with India, China, Pakistan and the US will also be priorities for a new administration. Navigating the current geopolitical turbulence will not be easy for any new government, not least for a country with the level of social, economic, political and historical baggage as Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens in Bangladesh offer lessons to other countries in South Asia and the Global South, notably those who have experienced Gen Z protests in recent months. How Bangladesh recovers and implements its renewed democracy will be a prominent signal for other countries in the region and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>India is facing multiple geopolitical challenges in the region as Bangladesh and Myanmar show signs of drifting away from New Delhi’s orbit amid its long-standing disputes with Pakistan and China.
Dhaka has been drawing closer to Islamabad following the downfall in 2024 of its former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who had close ties with Delhi during her rule, while China has continued to maintain its influence in Myanmar since the junta in Naypyidaw ousted the elected government in a coup in...</description>

      <description>The ICC is expected to visit Bangladesh for discussions regarding the national team&apos;s participation in the 2026 ICC T20 World Cup. Bangladesh&apos;s sports ministry and cricket board are firm on not traveling to India due to security concerns, insisting matches be played only in Sri Lanka. Dialogue continues to explore solutions.</description>

      <title>Multipolar South Asia</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967277/multipolar-south-asia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SOUTH Asia remained largely bipolar during the Cold War era due to India’s inward-looking approach and Pakistan’s proactive alignment with the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the balance of power steadily shifted in India’s favour in the first quarter of the 21st century. Islamabad’s internal security and economic fragility, a pro-India regime in Dhaka, Delhi’s rising economic profile, Beijing’s hesitation to proactively engage in South Asia’s security and strategic affairs and Washington’s decision to embolden India as a bulwark against China led to the emergence of a belligerent India in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is the only constant in international affairs. This also applies to South Asia, where the region is witnessing profound geopolitical shifts. Today, Pakistan wants to reclaim its political space in South Asia. Beijing is eager to expand its footprint in the region, while Dhaka is showing defiance against Delhi’s assertive policies and domestic interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamabad considers it a conducive environment for promoting the idea of a ‘multipolar’ South Asia. Islamabad believes that a resurgent Pakistan, assertive Bangladesh and proactive China can effectively limit Indian influence and reclaim its strategic space in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the South Asian context, multipolarity does not imply the emergence of several equal great powers, but rather the dilution of India’s structural dominance through the rise of alternative and consequential regional pillars. Multipolarity, as envisaged by Islamabad, signifies a regional order in which China, Bangladesh and Pakistan emerge as equally important strategic, economic and political poles alongside India, rather than remaining peripheral or subordinate actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Asian states have already welcomed Chinese economic activities under the Belt &amp;amp; Road Initiative. Now, Islamabad envisages a proactive approach by Beijing in establishing sub-regional forums sans India, and deeper technological and security cooperation with smaller South Asian states. Similarly, Islamabad is trying to embolden Dhaka as an assertive power within the South Asian region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamabad has calculated that a politically independent, economically stable and militarily assertive Dhaka will challenge India’s assertive policies. A stronger Bangladesh with advanced air and naval power will challenge Delhi’s uncontested influence in the Bay of Bengal. Hence, an emboldened Dhaka will indirectly complement Islamabad’s strategic overtures in South Asia. This is why Islamabad is strengthening Dhaka’s defence through deepening cooperation in the naval, air and military domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multipolar South Asia will limit Delhi’s ability to unilaterally shape the norms of regional forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multipolarity in South Asian affairs will introduce several strategic and political opportunities for the regional states. First, the significance of smaller South Asian states such as the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan will increase in a multipolar South Asia as the competing powers will likely try to persuade them to join their respective blocs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a multipolar South Asia will also increase strategic and political options for smaller South Asian states. Historically, the smaller South Asian states did not enjoy abundant strategic options; rather, they had to rely only on India. In a multipolar South Asia, smaller states will have the diplomatic flexibility to adopt an issue-based cooperation strategy on trade, energy, climate, security, etc, rather than entering into rigid bloc politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a multipolar South Asia will limit Delhi’s ability to unilaterally shape the norms of regional forums. For instance, Delhi’s unilateral decision to boycott Saarc in 2016 paralysed the only regional forum in South Asia. However, a multipolar South Asia will create space for alternative sub-regional frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, attempts for the establishment of a multipolar South Asia will enhance Pakistan’s regional and global political profile as a facilitator of multi-vector regional alignment rather than simply being a bilateral rival of India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are significant risks involved in promoting the idea of a multipolar South Asia. First, Islamabad’s attempts towards the establishment of a multipolar South Asia will lead to another episode of intense geopolitical competition within the region. This intensified geopolitical competition will adversely affect efforts for regional connectivity. In this intense competitive environment, South Asian states will prioritise sub-regional forums over regional frameworks as consensus-building in a regional forum is perhaps near impossible. One practical manifestation is the growing emphasis on mini-lateral frameworks that operate outside India-centric regional institutions. The establishment of the Bangladesh-China-Pakistan strategic forum reflects this evolving trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Delhi will resist a multipolar South Asia through economic resources, diplomatic campaigns and establishing strategic partnerships with its neighbouring countries to reassert its primacy in the region. These strategies will add pressure on the foreign policy of smaller South Asian states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the uncertain domestic political environment of Bangladesh with its inconsistent foreign policy approaches, and long-standing Pakistan-Bangladesh issues such as Dhaka’s demands for an apology for the 1971 events and repayment of assets in undivided Pakistan, may hinder efforts towards a strengthened and effective multipolar South Asia in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning, Islamabad has been concerned about the South Asian region becoming hostage to a single dominating power. While smaller South Asian states, too, had inherent insecurities on account of India, they tried to address them through engagement with New Delhi — on the latter’s terms. Islamabad, on the contrary, tried to challenge Indian dominance with a two-pronged strategy. Externally, it formed an alliance with the West to militarily enable itself against India, while within the region, it made efforts to establish a regional organisation (Saarc) in 1985 with the help of smaller South Asian states to defy the single country’s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamabad considers it another ‘1985 moment’, when it successfully aligned with smaller South Asian states and persuaded New Delhi to operate as one stakeholder among many, rather than as the region’s sole arbiter. The critical question is whether Islamabad’s push for a multipolar South Asia will replicate its 1985 success or reinforce regional polarisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The writer is an analyst of South Asian affairs. The views expressed are his own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A report highlights 15 Hindu minority murders in Bangladesh by Muslims between December 2025 and January 2026.  The Interim Government, led by Chief Advisor Dr. Muhammad Yunus, is reportedly dismissing these attacks as disinformation.

      <title>US immigrant visa processing pause: Pakistanis will still be able to submit applications, attend scheduled interviews</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967126/us-immigrant-visa-processing-pause-pakistanis-will-still-be-able-to-submit-applications-attend-scheduled-interviews</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: The US State Department has clarified that applicants from Pakistan and 74 other countries, which are facing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966944&quot;&gt;suspension of immigrant visa processing&lt;/a&gt;, will be allowed to submit applications and attend scheduled interviews despite the freeze. However, no immigrant visas will be issued during the newly announced pause that takes effect on January 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/immigrant-visa-processing-updates-for-nationalities-at-high-risk-of-public-benefits-usage.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;question-and-answer guidance&lt;/a&gt; released alongside the new policy, the department said that the suspension does not revoke any immigrant visas already issued, nor does it apply to tourist or other non-immigrant visas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions related to admission into the United States, it added, fell under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance also states that dual nationals applying with a valid passport from a country not included on the affected list are exempt from the pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is among more the 75 countries whose nationals will be affected under the new measure, which the State Department said is part of a comprehensive review ordered by President Donald Trump to ensure that immigrants are “financially self-sufficient and not a financial burden to Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Trump has made clear that immigrants must be financially self-sufficient,” the department said, adding that all policies, regulations and guidance are being reviewed to prevent immigrants from becoming a public charge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sweeping list spans Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and eastern Europe, and includes countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Nigeria, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Russia and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to internal guidance cited by officials, exceptions may be granted if an applicant can demonstrate that their travel would serve an “America First” national interest, though the criteria for such exemptions have not been publicly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance also instructs consular officers that if an immigrant visa has already been approved but has not yet been printed, the case must be refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department said US embassies and consulates will continue to schedule immigrant visa appointments for affected nationals during the pause, but issuance will remain suspended while the review is underway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh Cricket Board removes director Najmul Islam amid player boycott</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967108/bangladesh-cricket-board-removes-director-najmul-islam-amid-player-boycott</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Thursday removed director Najmul Islam following protests from players ahead of Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) matches over his comments against the country’s cricketers, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first BPL match scheduled for 1pm local time today was delayed as players from Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express did not show up at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium for the game, according to &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/sports-special/bpl-2026/news/thursdays-first-bpl-match-hit-boycott-4081616&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was handed a show-cause notice by the BCB a few hours before the match was set to begin. However, the Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) had called for a nationwide boycott on all forms of cricket unless Islam tenders his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a media release today, the BCB said the decision to remove Islam was taken by president Aminul Islam Bulbul “following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation”, and that it would come into effect immediately, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/cricket/news/bcb-removes-director-najmul-finance-role-amid-player-boycott-4081746&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The decision has been taken in accordance with the authority vested in the BCB President under Article 31 of the BCB Constitution and is aimed at ensuring the continued smooth and effective functioning of the Board’s affairs,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Board remains fully committed to upholding the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this regard, the BCB hopes that all cricketers will continue to display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication to the betterment of Bangladesh cricket, and will do their utmost to ensure continued participation in the Bangladesh Premier League,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until further notice, Bulbul will serve as the acting chairman of the finance committee that Islam was the chair of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam had said on Wednesday night that he believes national cricketers should be asked to return the “crores and crores of taka” that the BCB spends on them, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/bangladesh-cricketers-threaten-boycott-unless-bcb-director-nazmul-islam-resigns-1519512&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESPN Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB officially distanced itself from Islam’s comments and expressed its “sincere regret for remarks that may be deemed inappropriate, offensive, or hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bangladesh Cricket Board also makes it clear that it will take appropriate disciplinary action against any individual whose conduct or comments show disrespect towards cricketers or cause harm to the reputation and integrity of Bangladesh cricket,” the board said in a statement, per &lt;em&gt;Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boycott was proposed by Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB), hours after Islam’s press conference at the BCB’s headquarters in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The remark made by the BCB director [Najmul Islam] has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly, and it’s not acceptable,” Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We demand his resignation. If he doesn’t resign before tomorrow’s match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow (Thursday).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;, Najmul said the board owes no compensation to players if Bangladesh miss the upcoming world cup, arguing that the BCB has never sought refunds from cricketers after poor performances at global events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question [of compensation] does not even arise. We have invested so much [in] them, they haven’t been able to achieve anything, anywhere,” &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; quoted Islam as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have we won a single global trophy till now? Then we could’ve said every time, you have failed to perform, whatever we have spent on you, now we will take it back. Return it to us,” Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam’s comments came amid Bangladesh’s standoff with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966750&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to travel to India for next month’s T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka, which is co-hosting the tournament beginning February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, led by Litton Das, are &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/team-rankings/mens/t20i&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;placed ninth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the ICC T20 rankings. They have played all nine editions of the tournament, but have never qualified for the semi-finals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh cricket sees local turmoil after players boycott premier league match, director given show-cause notice</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967108/bangladesh-cricket-sees-local-turmoil-after-players-boycott-premier-league-match-director-given-show-cause-notice</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh cricket took a hit as players boycotted the first Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) match on Thursday and demanded the resignation of Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Director Najmul Islam after he was handed a show-cause notice following controversial comments against the country’s cricketers on Wednesday, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; reported.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes amid Bangladesh’s standoff with the International Cricket Council over its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966750&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to travel to India for next month’s ICC T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka, which is co-hosting the tournament beginning February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first BPL match scheduled for 1pm local time today was delayed as players from Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express did not show up at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium for the game, according to &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/sports-special/bpl-2026/news/thursdays-first-bpl-match-hit-boycott-4081616&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was handed a show-cause notice by the BCB a few hours before the match was set to begin. However, the Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) has called for a nationwide boycott on all forms of cricket unless Islam tenders his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam, the board’s finance committee chairman, said on Wednesday night that he believes national cricketers should be asked to return the “crores and crores of taka” that the BCB spends on them, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/bangladesh-cricketers-threaten-boycott-unless-bcb-director-nazmul-islam-resigns-1519512&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESPN Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB officially distanced itself from Islam’s comments and expressed its “sincere regret for remarks that may be deemed inappropriate, offensive, or hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bangladesh Cricket Board also makes it clear that it will take appropriate disciplinary action against any individual whose conduct or comments show disrespect towards cricketers or cause harm to the reputation and integrity of Bangladesh cricket,” the board said in a statement, per &lt;em&gt;Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boycott was proposed by Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB), hours after Islam’s press conference at the BCB’s headquarters in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The remark made by the BCB director [Najmul Islam] has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly, and it’s not acceptable,” Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We demand his resignation. If he doesn’t resign before tomorrow’s match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow (Thursday).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;, Najmul said the board owes no compensation to players if Bangladesh miss the upcoming world cup, arguing that the BCB has never sought refunds from cricketers after poor performances at global events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question [of compensation] does not even arise. We have invested so much [in] them, they haven’t been able to achieve anything, anywhere,” &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; quoted Islam as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have we won a single global trophy till now? Then we could’ve said every time, you have failed to perform, whatever we have spent on you, now we will take it back. Return it to us,” Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, led by Litton Das, are &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/team-rankings/mens/t20i&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;placed ninth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the ICC T20 rankings. They have played all nine editions of the tournament, but have never qualified for the semi-finals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>US announces suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan, 74 other countries from Jan 21</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966944/us-announces-suspension-of-immigrant-visa-processing-for-pakistan-74-other-countries-from-jan-21</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: The US has announced a suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan and 74 other countries, effective January 21, citing concerns that immigrants from these nations often rely on public welfare programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department said the freeze will remain in place until authorities can ensure that new immigrants will not draw on American taxpayer resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StateDept/status/2011478657680757214?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials described the measure as part of the administration’s “America First” approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused,” an official said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Department spokesperson Tommy Piggott said in a statement that his department “will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Immigration from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassesses immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the countries affected by the freeze are Somalia, Haiti, Iran, Eritrea, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, covering regions in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. All categories of US immigrant visas — including family, employment, and diversity visas — are impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#impact-on-pakistanis&quot; id=&quot;impact-on-pakistanis&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Impact on Pakistanis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suspension could delay travel, study, and work plans for thousands of Pakistanis who annually seek US visas. Pakistani consulates in the US are expected to provide guidance to affected applicants in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#public-charge-rule&quot; id=&quot;public-charge-rule&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Public-charge rule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visa freeze is linked to the US public-charge rule, which evaluates whether immigrants are likely to rely on government assistance. While suspensions of visa services have occurred in the past, officials said the scope of this action is unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No timeline has been given for resuming visa services, but the State Department assured that countries would be notified once the review is complete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ikkis: An Ode To A Valiant Indian Soldier</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/medley/ikkis-ode-valiant-indian-soldier</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story of Arun’s role in the Battle of Basantar did not end on that day, or even after the cease fire of this two weeks war, resulting in the demise of East Pakistan and the announcement of the newly liberated Bangladesh. Major Khwaja  Mohammad Nasir, then a Squadron Commander of 13th Lancers, the regiment pitched against Poona Horse, who came bandaged the next day to collect the dead bodies of his fallen comrades, wanted to know more about “ the officer, who stood like an insurmountable rock” and whose troop of three British World War II vintage Centurion tanks  was responsible for decimation of his entire squadron of  fourteen American Patton tanks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-cutline&quot;&gt;The sign outside the US State Department building in Washington, DC, as seen on 11 July 2025 (Annabelle Gordon/Reuters)&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-wide-photo-video&quot;&gt;Off&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration on Wednesday announced that it will suspend the issuance of immigrant visas to the nationals of 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, Russia, and Somalia, starting on 21 January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates,&quot; the agency said in a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement said that the affected countries, &quot;including Somalia, Haiti, Iran, and&amp;nbsp;Eritrea&quot;, make for immigrants who &quot;often become public charges on the United States upon arrival&quot;, meaning they apply for and use government benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused,&quot; the State Department said. &quot;The Trump Administration will always put America First.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has long been routine for asylum-seekers and refugees to the US, in particular, to access social welfare benefits via systems in each state designed to get them on their feet and ease them into the community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with immigration to the US now at a nearly 50-year low because of the Trump administration&apos;s aggressive crackdown, it&apos;s likely those services will be significantly scaled back.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the full list of impacted countries was not announced by the government, a Fox News report citing an internal memo from the State Department named the following:&amp;nbsp;Afghanistan; Albania; Algeria; Antigua and Barbuda; Armenia; Azerbaijan; Bahamas; Bangladesh; Barbados; Belarus; Belize; Bhutan; Bosnia; Brazil; Burma; Cambodia; Cameroon; Cape Verde; Colombia; Cote d’Ivoire; Cuba; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Dominica; Egypt; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Fiji; Gambia; Georgia; Ghana; Grenada; Guatemala; Guinea; Haiti; Iran; Iraq; Jamaica; Jordan; Kazakhstan; Kosovo; Kuwait; Kyrgyzstan; Laos; Lebanon; Liberia; Libya; Macedonia; Moldova; Mongolia; Montenegro; Morocco; Nepal; Nicaragua; Nigeria; Pakistan; Republic of the Congo; Russia; Rwanda; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Senegal; Sierra Leone; Somalia; South Sudan; Sudan; Syria; Tanzania; Thailand; Togo; Tunisia; Uganda; Uruguay; Uzbekistan; and Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-immigrant visas, business visas, and tourist visas will not be impacted, the AP reported, but everyone coming to the US will face a heightened screening process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is now five months away from hosting the Fifa 2026 World Cup along with Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Administration officials have previously said they expect some five million people or more to come to the US for the event, but independent analysts have put that number at below one million, given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/world-cup-2026-us-gives-no-assurances-immigration-officers-wont-raid-stadiums&quot;&gt;more aggressive vetting&lt;/a&gt; procedures that could include searches of phones and social media accounts, as well as the risk of lengthy detentions without due process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;At least 100,000 visas revoked&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has posited itself as the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all-55-million-us-visa-holders-open-revocations-and-deportations-trump-administration-says&quot;&gt;anti-immigrant&lt;/a&gt; government yet, having so far &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/trump-has-revoked-100000-visas-foreign-nationals-since-trump-took-office&quot;&gt;revoked at least 100,000 visas&lt;/a&gt;, deported some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/27/dhs-removes-more-half-million-illegal-aliens-us&quot;&gt;half a million&lt;/a&gt; immigrants, and put some 70,000 others in immigration detention centres that have been criticised for overcrowding, lack of hygiene, and poisoned food.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US asylum programme has effectively been terminated, and temporary protected status (TPS) for those unable to return to unsafe countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/trump-administration-end-legal-protections-some-somalis-mid-march&quot;&gt;has been cancelled&lt;/a&gt; for Afghans, Syrians, Somalis, and Venezuelans, among others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security has been on a massive recruitment drive for agents who can act as bounty hunters and meet daily quotas for arresting suspected undocumented immigrants and even legal immigrants whose records contain encounters with law enforcement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos have gone viral of masked and heavily armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents violently dragging people out of their cars and away from their children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of those arrested have not been seen since, prompting widespread fear among immigrant communities as well as naturalised US citizens, especially those who are visibly non-white or are overheard speaking languages other than English.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has said he is considering revoking citizenship, and he has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on banning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-supreme-court-limits-judges-block-trump-order-birthright-citizenship&quot;&gt;birthright citizenship&lt;/a&gt; for non-American parents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>US to suspend immigrant visa processing from 75 countries over public assistance concerns</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/article/trump-immigration-visas-79909bd01e9e1e3dedde144f865a1b9d</link>

(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;p&gt;2026-01-14T17:07:28Z&lt;/p&gt;
                                        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department said Wednesday it will suspend the processing of immigrant visas for citizens of 75 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Russia and Somalia, whose nationals the Trump administration has deemed likely to require public assistance while living in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department, led by &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-cabinet-marco-rubio-secretary-of-state-nominee-39c378e19d0327a7f091f302daf8ca3e&quot;&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, said it had instructed consular officers to halt immigrant visa applications from the countries affected in accordance with &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/immigration-public-charge-trump-benefits-visas-0929b2c8f635479173929300cb683a27&quot;&gt;a broader order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; issued in November that tightened rules around potential immigrants who might become “public charges” in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspension, which will begin Jan. 21, will not apply to applicants seeking non-immigrant visas, or temporary tourist or business visas, who make up the vast majority of visa seekers. Demand for non-immigrant visas is expected to rise dramatically in the coming months and years due to the upcoming 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics both of which the U.S. will host or co-host.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt; “The Trump administration is bringing an end to the abuse of America’s immigration system by those who would extract wealth from the American people,” the department said in a statement. “Immigrant visa processing from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;


    
        




    


&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump’s administration has already severely restricted immigrant and non-immigrant visa processing for citizens of dozens of countries, many of them in Africa, Asia and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
        
            
                
    
    &lt;a id=&quot;html-embed-module-e30000&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


    
    &lt;p&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;

            
        
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The November guidance on which Wednesday’s decision is based directed U.S. embassy and consulate officials to comprehensively and thoroughly vet visa applicants to demonstrate that they will not need to rely on public benefits from the government any time after their admission in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;While federal law already required those seeking permanent residency or legal status to prove they wouldn’t be a public charge, Trump in his first term widened the range of benefit programs that could disqualify applicants, and the guidelines in the cable appear to go further in scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigrants seeking entry into the U.S. already undergo a medical exam by a physician who’s been approved by a U.S. Embassy. They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions or violence. They’re also required to have a number of vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new directive expanded those with more specific requirements. It said consular officials must consider a range of specific details about people seeking visas, including their age, health, family status, finances, education, skills and any past use of public assistance regardless of the country. It also said they should assess applicants’ English proficiency and can do so by conducting interviews in English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said at the time it could further limit who gets to enter the country at a time when the Republican administration is already &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/refugees-admissions-cap-immigration-trump-administration-197a8ef1c9c219ce6167da4aba3f5a6e&quot;&gt;tightening those rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;The countries affected by the suspension announced on Wednesday are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bosnia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Congo, Cuba, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Republic of the Congo, Russia, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan and Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Several countries ‘actively’ engaged in talks with Pakistan for its fighter jets, confirms PM Shehbaz</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966927/several-countries-actively-engaged-in-talks-with-pakistan-for-its-fighter-jets-confirms-pm-shehbaz</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif confirmed on Wednesday that several countries were “actively” engaged in talks with Pakistan for its fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, reports had surfaced of Pakistan being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966192/iraqi-air-chief-praises-pafs-professionalism-expresses-keen-interest-in-jf-17-thunder-jets&quot;&gt;in talks&lt;/a&gt; with several friendly countries for a deal on the JF-17, a light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing a federal cabinet meeting, PM Shehbaz recalled Pakistan’s victory in a war last year — ostensibly a reference to the four-day military conflict with India in May 2025 — and said the demand for Pakistan’s fighter jets had increased since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are several countries that are actively engaged in talks with Pakistan on this, and this will boost our defence production and benefit our economy,” the premier added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Defence Production Minister Raza Hayat Harraj also told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt; that Pakistan is engaged in discussions with “multiple” countries for the sale of &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pac.org.pk/jf-17&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JF-17 Thunder&lt;/a&gt; fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These negotiations are taking place and they take some time. Many countries have shown interest in these aircraft,” the minister was quoted as saying in an interview with &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/urdu/articles/cq6v9q1lmeqo&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot take the name of any country. Neither can I tell on what level our negotiations are with any country,” he told the British broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When these jets are exported, then the world will know which countries have bought them,” the report quoted him as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stressed that such matters were a country’s “jealously guarded secrets”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harraj further said, “Firstly, we must ensure that we only sell [JF-17s] to those who are our friendly countries. So they are not used against us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that China is on board whenever Pakistan signs such a deal with any country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defence production minister highlighted that the jets were battle-tested during the four-day conflict with India last year: “The entire world’s air forces saw these jets’ performance during that time and praised it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minister termed the price of the jet “an important” aspect, detailing that while the average value of such planes around the world was $250-350 million, the JF-17 Thunder was cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the exact value, he told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;, “Its value is around $40-50m; this depends on the jet’s features, and the price can also be higher than this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When enquired about whether China also received a share from the sale, Harraj was quoted as saying, “A lot of matters are discussed on the table. China is definitely included in them; it should be and it is their right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#production-capacity-a-secret&quot; id=&quot;production-capacity-a-secret&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Production capacity a secret’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a question about Pakistan’s production capacity, especially considering the interest of several countries, the minister told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;, “This is a question related to our national defence. These are our secrets, let them remain secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stressed that producing such “state-of-the-art” jets was a time-consuming task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the minister, “some portion of the jet is readied in Pakistan, and some portion is readied in China”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at China’s Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt; that “technology” involved in the jet was likely controlled by China. Therefore, any sale pact would be a joint agreement, with Beijing being a “senior partner”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“China might even increase Pakistan’s defence production, but all this will be in Beijing’s control,” the expert was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the air chiefs of Pakistan and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452/procurement-of-jf-17-aircraft-comes-under-discussion-during-meeting-between-air-chief-bangladeshi-counterpart&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; held detailed discussions on the “potential procurement” of JF-17s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin also visited Pakistan last week, holding meetings with the army chief and ACM Sindhu. The military’s media wing said that the minister expressed Jakarta’s desire to further expand defence ties with Islamabad.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh summons Myanmar envoy after border clashes</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966858/bangladesh-summons-myanmar-envoy-after-border-clashes</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh on Tuesday summoned the ambassador of Myanmar after civil war gun battles in the neighbouring country spilled over the border, wounding a Bangladeshi girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy fighting in Myanmar’s Rakhine state this month has involved junta soldiers, Arakan Army fighters and Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) militia guerrillas. Authorities said around a dozen villages in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar district have been affected by the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve-year-old Huzaifa Afnan was struck by a bullet, while a Bangladeshi fisherman had his leg ripped off after stepping on a landmine near the frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh reminded that the unprovoked firing towards Bangladesh is a blatant violation of international law and a hindrance to good neighbourly relations,” a foreign ministry press statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myanmar’s ambassador to Bangladesh, U Kyaw Soe Moe, was summoned to the foreign ministry on Tuesday, where he expressed sincere sympathy to the injured victims and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My daughter was supposed to go to school, but she is on a ventilator,” Afnan’s father Jasim Uddin said. “My heart is bleeding for my baby girl.” More than a million Rohingya have fled their homes in Myanmar, many after a 2017 military crackdown, and now eke out a living in sprawling refugee camps just across the border in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARSA, a Rohingya armed group formed to defend the persecuted Muslim minority, has been fighting the Myanmar military, as well as rival Arakan Army guerrillas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Bangladeshi border forces detained 53 ARSA fighters who had crossed the frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladesh is experiencing a surge in political violence and killings as its 13th parliamentary election approaches. Rights groups report a significant increase in deaths linked to political rivalry and dominance struggles. In response, political figures are hiring gunmen, and the Jamaat-e-Islami chief is seeking support from retired military officers to ensure a &quot;fear-free&quot; election.</description>

      <title>In meeting with ICC, Bangladesh reiterates its refusal to travel to India for T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966750/in-meeting-with-icc-bangladesh-reiterates-its-refusal-to-travel-to-india-for-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s cricket board said on Tuesday it had repeated its refusal to travel to India for next month’s T20 World Cup during talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Cup begins on February 7, with Bangladesh scheduled to play their four group matches in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, during a video conference with the ICC, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said it had “reiterated its request for the ICC to consider relocating Bangladesh’s matches outside India”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BCB reaffirmed its position regarding the decision not to travel to India, citing security concerns,” the board said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the ICC highlighted that the tournament itinerary has already been announced and requested the BCB to reconsider its stance, the Board’s position remains unchanged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC has not commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB said discussions with the ICC continue to “explore possible solutions”, it added, but that it “remains committed to safeguarding the well-being of its players, officials and staff”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, led by Litton Das, are &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/team-rankings/mens/t20i&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;placed ninth&lt;/a&gt; in the ICC T20 rankings. They have played all nine editions of the tournament, but have never qualified for the semi-finals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political ties between India and Bangladesh soured after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1847298&quot;&gt;mass uprising&lt;/a&gt; in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mustafizur row: &apos;Position unchanged&apos; on India travel, B&apos;desh tells ICC; repeats &apos;security concerns&apos;</title>

      <description>Bangladesh Cricket Board reaffirmd its stance against traveling to India for the T20 World Cup 2026 due to security concerns, requesting matches be moved. The ICC has rejected these claims, urging Bangladesh to reconsider, but the BCB&apos;s position remains unchanged. Discussions are ongoing to find a resolution.</description>

      <description>Bangladesh&apos;s sports advisor claimed the nation would boycott the 2026 T20 World Cup in India, citing security concerns and an alleged ICC assessment. However, the ICC has firmly refuted these claims, stating their independent risk assessments found no specific threats and did not recommend squad changes or election postponements. Bangladesh&apos;s matches remain scheduled in India.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh standoff exposes ICC’s governance crisis ahead of T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966651/bangladesh-standoff-exposes-iccs-governance-crisis-ahead-of-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WITH less than three weeks to go before the T20 World Cup starts, the cricketing world looks on as the sport’s global governing body deals with yet another crisis. The latest, too, involves India — the country from where the International Cricket Council’s chairman and the CEO come from — naturally as the co-hosts of the 20-team showpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh don’t want to play their matches in India and want them to be shifted to co-hosts Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things have come to this point after worsening political relations between the two countries over the last 12 months saw Bangladesh’s star pacer Mustafizur Rahman being withdrawn from Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders’ squad on the directives of the country’s cricket board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia cited “recent developments” as the reason for Mustafizur’s ouster. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) responded strongly, deciding not to play in India with security having become a major concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the BCB said on Wednesday that the “ICC has conveyed its willingness to work closely” with the board to resolve the issue, the latter itself has chosen to not comment on the issue with reports emerging on Monday that Chennai and Thirivananthapuram have been put forward as venue to host Bangladesh’s matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also remains a possibility of Bangladesh not participating in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC, while trying to negotiate with the BCB, has not been able to show any kind of muscle as a governing body, especially against the host nation’s board for letting cricket be affected by politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises question marks over the ICC’s standing as a governing body in the face of India’s dominance via producing the major chunk of revenue that runs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body is led by Bharatiya Janata Party leader and India’s Home Minister Amit Shah’s son Jay, while ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta is also Indian. As former ICC president and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ehsan Mani views it, “the BCCI follows the political agenda of the BJP”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC should have a clear policy of not allowing member countries’ politics to interfere with the game,” he told Dawn last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying the involvement of politics in the making of the decisions that run the sport as the most important concern, Mani claimed other strong cricket boards were not serious about taking it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, ECB [England and Wales Cricket Board] and CA [Cricket Australia] together with BCCI are not prepared to address this and other serious governance issues and together they have prevented ICC from carrying out a governance review which I was pushing for as chairman of PCB,” he said. “The ICC board is terribly conflicted, with each director looking after his country’s interest before considering what is good for the game as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mani said he expected the Bangladesh situation to be resolved through “a fudged solution, which will be engineered without addressing the governance failings of the ICC”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) chairman Dave Cameron, who served in the ICC’s Finance and Com­mercial Affairs committee between 2013-19, echoed Mani’s views, saying that the ICC needed to switch from being “a group of members” to becoming a proper governing body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Part of the challenge is that the ICC is not a governing council but is rather made up of countries that sit together as a members’ group, and this is unfortunate,” Cameron told Dawn. “As a governing council, there are some requirements, it’s not being used in that way, which is the detriment at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAKISTAN’S OPPORTUNITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not the first time that security concerns triggered by political tensions between India and another country have come to put a tournament at risk. When India hosted the 50-over Cricket World Cup in 2023, the PCB was convinced days before the event to send the national team across the border. A stronger deadlock emerged ahead of last year’s Champions Trophy — of which the official hosts were Pakis­tan — with India refusing to return their neighbours’ 2023 gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC had to come up with a “hybrid model” to resolve the Champions Trophy matter and decided that Pakistan and India will play at neutral venues if the global tournament is being hosted by either of the two nations. That decision was hailed as Pakistan’s psychological win in the backdrop of the Indian financial and administrative muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the recent political shift in Bangladesh triggered by Sheikh Hasina’s ouster as the country’s prime minister and a consequential change of regime in the BCB, the PCB, led by Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, has got closer to the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi — also the Asian Cricket Council chief currently — and BCB president Aminul Islam were also reportedly at the forefront in making the 2025 Asia Cup happen amid calls for a boycott coming from India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former PCB chairman Najam Sethi, who himself has been in the midst of the Pakistan-India cricket issues during his previous tenure, the ongoing tensions are an opportunity for the PCB to form a pressure bloc within the ICC along with the BCB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Earlier, on any issue, Pakistan could not count on support from any ICC member if its stance differed from India’s, now it will have Bangladesh on its side,” Sethi told Dawn. “Their joint clout will be greater than the sum of their parts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan cricket leadership seemed to have sensed the opportunity after Mustafizur was snubbed by the BCCI as it the PCB announced zealously days after the fast bowler’s registration for the Pakistan Super League’s players’ draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media feeds on Sunday, meanwhile, carried unconfirmed reports of the PCB offering to host Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup matches in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PCB and BCB should scratch each other’s shoulders in their respective leagues to cobble a common front against the rest of the Boards,” Sethi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Monday evening, BCCI secretary Saikia, as per reports, confirmed no communication was made by the ICC over a potential change of venues for the Bangladesh matches. Henceforth, as the clock ticked and the T20 World Cup neared, uncertainty prevailed and so did the ICC’s deafening silence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>With the sleeves rolled up</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966713/with-the-sleeves-rolled-up</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE world is in ferment as the US lurches dangerously to the extreme right. Europe too has discarded a long cultivated democratic pretence and is eyeing its chance in the melee. Hungary, Poland, Austria and Italy have been singled out by Donald Trump’s strategists, according to their leaked documents, to subvert democracy for a right-wing takeover in Trump’s footsteps. British, French and German establishments are nudging their countries also towards militarism. EU is targeting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961041&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, Palestine and Iran even as Nato looks poised to implode in the chaos of Trump’s claims over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966583/greenland-rejects-us-takeover-under-any-circumstance&quot;&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;. The EU seeks to humour Trump over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964877&quot;&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; while retaining a different yardstick to judge Vladimir Putin’s advances in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966294/unsc-calls-emergency-session-on-ukraine-tomorrow&quot;&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the masses are retaliating. Venezuela and Mexico are staging massive rallies with sleeves rolled up to combat Trump’s threat to them. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, sensing enough was enough of his neighbour, is mending his country’s ties with China. He could be visiting Beijing shortly to counter the ultimatums to Canada’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, this is the time for the left to be initiating and, where possible, spearheading mass movements against the rightward slide. Jeremy Corbyn recently unfurled the flag with a separate party to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1926419&quot;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; the British establishment, which includes his former Labour Party colleagues who he watched with dismay removing the last stitch of morality by abetting Benjamin Netanyahu’s genocide in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon is leading a mass upsurge against Emmanuel Macron and the EU, accusing European leaders of “prostrate servility” to Trump. Mélenchon homed in on President Emmanuel Macron’s ideas on sending troops and long-range weapons to Ukraine. He demanded referendums in Donbass, Crimea and all contested regions because “it’s the people who decide” rather than warmongering elites who “don’t give a damn about people’s lives”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the time for the left to be initiating and, where possible, spearheading mass movements against the rightward slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left in the US is punching above its weight to hold its ground, using every chink in Trump’s armour to put up a promising fight for democracy. In the absence of trustworthy support from the mainstream media, YouTube channels are abuzz with analysts and activists keeping Trump in their crosshairs. A white woman activist raging against MAGA’s nativism was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965792&quot;&gt;murdered&lt;/a&gt; by Trump’s hired guns from ICE. The killing in Minneapolis has set off a prairie fire across states. In the absence of vocal criticism of Trump from the Congress, the left, increasingly joined by Jewish students and senior scholars, is intervening strategically to ensure that Trump gets his comeuppance in the November mid-term polls and thereby can be reined in from doing further damage. Regardless of the outcome the left won’t be accused of sitting on its hands when America was dismembering democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil and Colombia have slammed Trump’s abduction of a fellow Latin American president from his home in Caracas. Trump’s toolkit for Iran is different. A colour revolution is being quelled, says Pepe Escobar, a well-regarded Brazilian observer of the Middle East. Regardless of the images posted in Western media, Escobar says the Iranian leadership is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966486&quot;&gt;braced&lt;/a&gt; for another round of war with US and Israel, only this time better prepared. It is a testament to the feckless ways of the left that a group like Mujahideen-i-Khalq, which was instrumental in deposing the Shah of Iran, has become a catspaw for Israeli and US intrusion in its own country. Veteran Iran watchers are sanguine that without the organisational skills and a well-oiled machinery of the deeply camouflaged Mujahideen-i-Khalq, Reza Pahlavi, the former crown prince would have no standing with the rioters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf has also been jolted by the events in Venezuela. “We are entering an era where international guarantees are fragile, institutions are weakened and power speaks louder than principle. Awareness today is not a luxury; it is a requirement for survival,” &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.arabnews.com/node/2628571&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cautioned&lt;/a&gt; Saudi Arabia’s &lt;em&gt;Arab News&lt;/em&gt;. It stressed that the seizure of Russian funds in Western banks was a betrayal of crucial trust that the world took for granted. “The lesson is clear. The time to act is now.” Interestingly, the writer in the Saudi paper is prominent UAE businessman Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor. It says something for the thread that still unifies the two countries despite their recent aloofness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Asia is inevitably deeply affected by the turn of events unfolding at breakneck speed in the Middle East and in Latin America. Pakistan, currently in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962789&quot;&gt;good books&lt;/a&gt; of Trump (for no palpable reason), has spoken out boldly on the heist in Venezuela, with its defence minister reportedly calling for the abduction of Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu by the US (instead of Nicolás Maduro who should be freed). Bangladesh has witnessed street protests for Nicolás Maduro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, India, once a champion of lost causes in the Global South has been slow poisoned into becoming a basket case by its leaders seeking anchor in the West. When George W. Bush was in bad odour right across the world, a PEW survey said India was the rare country where Bush was popular. What does that say about the current leadership? Pulverised as a stag caught in the headlights of an approaching truck, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has left his foreign policy to the tender care of hope and prayer. What excites him, however, is any lurking campaign to win another state election, or even a municipal poll, preferably by communally polarising voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi’s calendar this year perhaps captures the essence of his preferences and fears. To cheer him, assembly polls are due in opposition-ruled West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in May. On the other hand, he is to host the BRICS summit around August, which comes with the terror of having to take an unequivocal stand on Trump’s thuggery and India’s one-sided love with the US. In the meantime, China, Russia and Iran began a week of joint naval exercises in South Africa’s waters on Saturday. The ‘BRICS Plus operation’ would “ensure the safety of shipping and maritime economic activities”. The sleeves have been rolled up, mostly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BD standoff exposes ICC’s governance crisis ahead of T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966651/bd-standoff-exposes-iccs-governance-crisis-ahead-of-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WITH less than three weeks to go before the T20 World Cup starts, the cricketing world looks on as the sport’s global governing body deals with yet another crisis. The latest, too, involves India — the country from where the International Cricket Council’s chairman and the CEO come from — naturally as the co-hosts of the 20-team showpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh don’t want to play their matches in India and want them to be shifted to co-hosts Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have come to this point after worsening political relations between the two countries over the last 12 months saw Bangladesh’s star pacer Mustafizur Rahman being withdrawn from Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders’ squad on the directives of the country’s cricket board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia cited “recent developments” as the reason for Mustafizur’s ouster. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) responded strongly, deciding not to play in India with security having become a major concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the BCB said on Wednesday that the “ICC has conveyed its willingness to work closely” with the board to resolve the issue, the latter itself has chosen to not comment on the issue with reports emerging on Monday that Chennai and Thirivananthapuram have been put forward as venue to host Bangladesh’s matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also remains a possibility of Bangladesh not participating in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICC, while trying to negotiate with the BCB, has not been able to show any kind of muscle as a governing body, especially against the host nation’s board for letting cricket be affected by politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises question marks over the ICC’s standing as a governing body in the face of India’s dominance via producing the major chunk of revenue that runs it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body is led by Bharatiya Janata Party leader and India’s Home Minister Amit Shah’s son Jay, while ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta is also Indian. As former ICC president and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ehsan Mani views it, “the BCCI follows the political agenda of the BJP”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The ICC should have a clear policy of not allowing member countries’ politics to interfere with the game,” he told Dawn last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the involvement of politics in the making of the decisions that run the sport as the most important concern, Mani claimed other strong cricket boards were not serious about taking it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, ECB [England and Wales Cricket Board] and CA [Cricket Australia] together with BCCI are not prepared to address this and other serious governance issues and together they have prevented ICC from carrying out a governance review which I was pushing for as chairman of PCB,” he said. “The ICC board is terribly conflicted, with each director looking after his country’s interest before considering what is good for the game as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mani said he expected the Bangladesh situation to be resolved through “a fudged solution, which will be engineered without addressing the governance failings of the ICC”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) chairman Dave Cameron, who served in the ICC’s Finance and Com­mercial Affairs committee between 2013-19, echoed Mani’s views, saying that the ICC needed to switch from being “a group of members” to becoming a proper governing body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Part of the challenge is that the ICC is not a governing council but is rather made up of countries that sit together as a members’ group, and this is unfortunate,” Cameron told Dawn. “As a governing council, there are some requirements, it’s not being used in that way, which is the detriment at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PAKISTAN’S OPPORTUNITY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not the first time that security concerns triggered by political tensions between India and another country have come to put a tournament at risk. When India hosted the 50-over Cricket World Cup in 2023, the PCB was convinced days before the event to send the national team across the border. A stronger deadlock emerged ahead of last year’s Champions Trophy — of which the official hosts were Pakis­tan — with India refusing to return their neighbours’ 2023 gesture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICC had to come up with a “hybrid model” to resolve the Champions Trophy matter and decided that Pakistan and India will play at neutral venues if the global tournament is being hosted by either of the two nations. That decision was hailed as Pakistan’s psychological win in the backdrop of the Indian financial and administrative muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent political shift in Bangladesh triggered by Sheikh Hasina’s ouster as the country’s prime minister and a consequential change of regime in the BCB, the PCB, led by Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, has got closer to the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naqvi — also the Asian Cricket Council chief currently — and BCB president Aminul Islam were also reportedly at the forefront in making the 2025 Asia Cup happen amid calls for a boycott coming from India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former PCB chairman Najam Sethi, who himself has been in the midst of the Pakistan-India cricket issues during his previous tenure, the ongoing tensions are an opportunity for the PCB to form a pressure bloc within the ICC along with the BCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Earlier, on any issue, Pakistan could not count on support from any ICC member if its stance differed from India’s, now it will have Bangladesh on its side,” Sethi told Dawn. “Their joint clout will be greater than the sum of their parts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan cricket leadership seemed to have sensed the opportunity after Mustafizur was snubbed by the BCCI as it the PCB announced zealously days after the fast bowler’s registration for the Pakistan Super League’s players’ draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media feeds on Sunday, meanwhile, carried unconfirmed reports of the PCB offering to host Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup matches in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“PCB and BCB should scratch each other’s shoulders in their respective leagues to cobble a common front against the rest of the Boards,” Sethi said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Monday evening, BCCI secretary Saikia, as per reports, confirmed no communication was made by the ICC over a potential change of venues for the Bangladesh matches. Henceforth, as the clock ticked and the T20 World Cup neared, uncertainty prevailed and so did the ICC’s deafening silence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>In 2024, following a movement led by the students in Bangladesh, and after the Awami League president and then Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina went into exile in India, a wave of arrests of Awami League leaders and activists began across the country. During that very crackdown, Proloy was arrested, and several cases were filed against him.</description>

      <title>Alternate venues in India floated for Bangladesh’s World Cup matches: report</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966566/alternate-venues-in-india-floated-for-bangladeshs-world-cup-matches-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram have been floated as potential alternate venues for Bangladesh to play their matches in the upcoming ICC T20 World Cup 2026, which is being hosted by India, according to &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/137229/chennai-thiruvananthapuram-emerge-as-options-for-bangladeshs-world-cup-matches&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cricbuzz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh last week &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/a&gt; the International Cricket Council (ICC) shift its games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a report by &lt;em&gt;Cricbuzz&lt;/em&gt; published on Sunday, there is no resolution on whether Bangladesh will travel to India to play its scheduled matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reported that alternative venues are being explored by the ICC and “it is unlikely they will be in Sri Lanka where Bangladesh insist on playing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been learnt that Tamil Nadu Cricket Association (TNCA) and Kerala Cricket Association (KCA) have been sounded out by the ICC and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), the co-hosts of the World Cup and the option of moving Bangladesh’s games to Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram are being explored,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It noted that neither TNCA nor KCA officials could be reached for comment, but that “it is learnt that they have expressed willingness to host the games”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“TNCA officials are believed to have told the ICC and BCCI that they will have no problem as they have eight pitches,” the report added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://sports.ndtv.com/t20-world-cup-2026/bcci-reacts-to-iccs-2-venue-solution-to-bangladesh-t20-world-cup-row-10720805&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;NDTV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia as saying on Monday that the BCCI had not recieved any update from the ICC regarding a reported shift in venue for Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup matches, stating that it was a matter of discussion between the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) and the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BCCI has not received any communication regarding the matter of shifting Bangladesh matches to Chennai or anywhere else, and it is beyond our control,“ he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is a matter of communication between the BCB and the ICC, as the ICC is the governing body. If the ICC conveys any decision to us regarding a change of venue, the BCCI, as the host, will take the necessary steps. At present, we are not privy to any such information,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Landmark genocide case against Myanmar to be heard by UN top court</title>
      <link>https://www.france24.com/en/landmark-genocide-case-against-myanmar-to-be-heard-by-un-top-court</link>
      <description>The United Nations&apos; top court will begin hearing a landmark genocide case against Myanmar on January 12, 2026. Gambia brought the case against the Southeast Asian country, accusing it of genocide of its Muslim Rohingya minority in the western Rakhine region in 2017. At least 730,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh after the violence. Myanmar has denied the accusation of genocide, saying at a preliminary hearing in 2019 that the accusations were misleading.</description>

      <title>Australia moves India, 3 other countries to ‘highest risk’ category for student visas: media</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966548/australia-moves-india-3-other-countries-to-highest-risk-category-for-student-visas-media</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Australia has tightened checks for student visa applicants from India, moving it to the ‘highest risk’ category along with Nepal, Bangladesh, and Bhutan, according to Australian and Indian media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times of India&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://t.co/S3HcITkPAu&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday that the re-rating of the countries was out of cycle, quoting Australian media, while the administration said this was triggered by “emerging integrity risks”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;TOI&lt;/em&gt; report, the administration did not cite any specific reason for which India had been assigned to a new category. However, it added that the move came after reports of “fake degree busts” in India which had reached international media.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/timesofindia/status/2010369861038280828&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“India alone accounts for almost 140,000 of Australia’s 650,000 international students, and the four nations represent nearly one-third of 2025 enrolments,” the Indian outlet said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#impact-on-students&quot; id=&quot;impact-on-students&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Impact on students&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assessment levels influence not only the documentary burden but also how easily prospective students can plan to study in Australia, according to &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theaustraliatoday.com.au/australia-tightens-international-student-integrity-checks-puts-india-nepal-and-bangladesh-into-highest-risk-countries/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Australia Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Higher levels typically require more extensive proof of finances, English proficiency and genuine temporary entrant intentions, among other criteria. These changes can slow processing times, increase applicant costs and discourage applicants if perceived as overly burdensome,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that international education stakeholder groups had stressed that clarity and predictability are essential, especially for countries that contribute significant student numbers and economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India, in particular, is one of Australia’s largest source markets for international students, it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Australian outlet, experts say the latest changes may lead to closer scrutiny of applications from South Asia, but also stress that genuine students still have pathways to study in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Australian Department of Education and Home Affairs is expected to publish detailed guidance for providers and agents explaining the basis for the updates and how documentation requirements will be implemented in practice, it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The sector will be watching closely for official documents that could explain whether the Assessment Level changes are temporary or if they signal a longer-term shift in how Australia manages risk across major international student source markets,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#fraudulent-applications&quot; id=&quot;fraudulent-applications&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Fraudulent applications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Authorities have seen evidence of a rise in suspected fraudulent documentation — both financial and academic — from certain source countries during recent visits to South Asia,” &lt;em&gt;The Australia Today&lt;/em&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia’s Minister for International Education Julian Hill, reportedly described Australia as having become “the least worst country of choice amongst the Big Four” destinations for international students — referring to global competitors such as the United States, United Kingdom and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hill said that this had prompted a stronger emphasis on documentary evidence and risk filtering to protect visa integrity, the Australian outlet reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;The Times of India&lt;/em&gt; said that according to experts, Australia now remained the only option among these destinations, as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1937854&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959178&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1952938&quot;&gt;Canada&lt;/a&gt; were shutting their doors to foreign students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It recently became obvious that student applicants who couldn’t get into those other three countries are increasingly applying to come to Australia, and in many cases we’ve seen an increase in fraudulent financial and academic documents,” &lt;em&gt;TOI&lt;/em&gt; quoted Phil Honeywood, chief executive officer of the International Education Association of Australia (IEAA), as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“By placing a number of these countries into the highest risk rating level, it automatically enhances any filtering of the student visa applicants to ensure bona fide study motivation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#concerns-over-ambiguity&quot; id=&quot;concerns-over-ambiguity&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Concerns over ambiguity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While some in the sector acknowledge the importance of maintaining rigour against fraud, the sudden jump in assessment levels — particularly the broad move of multiple large source countries such as India and Bangladesh to AL3 — has prompted questions about how risk is being measured and communicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Australia Today&lt;/em&gt; reported that Honeywood had raised concerns about the timing and frequency of assessment level changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that ambiguity around shifting risk categories was affecting education providers at a critical point in the academic calendar during the first intake of 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the outlet, he said that he had had a “long discussion” with Minister Hill about the sector’s concerns, “primarily with two aspects of the assessment level changes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“First and foremost, the frequency of change is causing confusion among providers here and agents offshore. Secondly, at the very time we are trying to ensure a good start to the year intake, we appear again as though we are not quite sure which countries we seek to recruit from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honeywood added that educational institutions needed stability and clear policy signals to properly plan recruitment efforts, liaise with agents and support prospective students trying to understand evolving visa requirements, the outlet added.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan’s struggle to scale its exports</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966540/pakistans-struggle-to-scale-its-exports</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For nearly two decades, Pakistan’s exports have remained stuck between $25–30 billion, despite repeated declarations that export-led growth is central to economic revival. Over the same period, Bangladesh has crossed $50bn, while Vietnam now exceeds $350bn. This widening gap is not the result of global shocks or bad luck. It reflects domestic policy choices that have made exporting costly, uncertain, and unrewarding — while protecting inefficiency at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Macroeconomic instability as a built-in disadvantage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful exporters require stable costs and predictable policy. Pakistan offers neither. Recurrent balance-of-payments crises trigger abrupt stabilisation programmes, policy reversals, and stop-start incentives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exchange-rate management has been particularly damaging. Periodic overvaluation to contain inflation acts as a hidden tax on exports, eroding competitiveness. When corrections eventually occur, they are sharp and disruptive, driving up input costs and debt servicing. Exporters are forced to operate in an environment where profitability can disappear overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exporters taxed as revenue sources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s export sector faces one of the most punitive tax regimes in the region. Exporters pay advance income tax, minimum turnover tax, super tax, and multiple withholding taxes across supply chains, while sales tax and duty drawback refunds are routinely delayed. This effectively turns exporters into involuntary lenders to the state, tying up working capital and raising borrowing costs. Smaller and mid-sized exporters — essential for diversification — are hit hardest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In competing economies, exports are genuinely zero-rated, with automated refunds and minimal compliance burdens. In Pakistan, exporters are taxed first and refunded later — if at all — despite already having to self-provide basic infrastructure, security, and logistics. This fiscal approach treats exports as a short-term revenue stream rather than a long-term growth strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Energy costs that destroy competitiveness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High and unpredictable energy prices further undermine export viability. Industry cross-subsidises domestic consumers, absorbs losses from theft and inefficiency, and pays capacity charges for unused generation. Penalising captive power to force grid usage has reduced industrial flexibility while merely shifting circular debt from electricity to gas. Given Pakistan’s concentration in low value-added exports, where energy is a large cost component, this disadvantage is decisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low value-added exports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s export base remains narrow and low value. Textiles dominate, but largely at the yarn, fabric, and basic garment level — segments with thin margins and intense competition. Some firms have exited higher value-added apparel altogether, whilst others are contemplating relocating production abroad. By contrast, Bangladesh invested in scale, compliance, and female labour participation to move up the garment value chain, while Vietnam diversified into electronics, engineering, and services.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Global demand is also shifting away from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955933&quot;&gt;cotton&lt;/a&gt; toward man-made fibres, weakening Pakistan’s traditional advantage. Without deliberate upgrading, innovation, and branding, export diversification will remain elusive — even as Pakistan’s land, water, and human capital offer opportunities in horticulture, livestock, dairy, seafood, minerals, information technology, and professional services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weak standards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food and agricultural exports face persistent quality and hygiene challenges. Inadequate domestic testing facilities force exporters to rely on foreign laboratories, raising costs and delays. Training and certification infrastructure remain underdeveloped. While exporters are allowed to open overseas marketing offices, funding limits are too low to support brand development or to secure shelf space. As a result, Pakistani brands have minimal global presence outside diaspora markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protectionism that rewards inefficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High tariffs and ad-hoc import restrictions raise input costs and disrupt supply chains. Recent changes under the Export Facilitation &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1914843&quot;&gt;Scheme&lt;/a&gt; — denying refunds on certain imported inputs — further penalise exporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protection has encouraged firms to prioritise secure domestic margins over global competitiveness. Medium-sized exporters, lacking inventory buffers, suffer most. Domestic consumers pay higher prices for lower-quality goods, while protected firms rarely evolve into serious exporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Productivity and skills gaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No incentive can compensate for low productivity. Pakistani firms face unreliable energy, inefficient logistics, and shortages of technical, managerial, and digital skills. While Vietnam benefits from a disciplined workforce and Bangladesh from broad labour participation, Pakistan continues to underinvest in human capital limiting its ability to upgrade exports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy inconsistency and weak credibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most damaging constraint is policy credibility. Export policies are announced without consultation, applied unevenly, and reversed under fiscal pressure. Temporary incentives and shifting rules discourage long-term investment. Export growth requires confidence that policies will endure beyond the next crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Both the government and businesses must change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While policy failures dominate, the private sector also bears responsibility. Too many firms focus on lobbying for protection rather than investing in competitiveness, innovation, and new markets. Despite duty-free access to the European Union and UK, Pakistan’s textile market share has stagnated, while China and Vietnam, despite tariffs, have expanded through superior cost, quality, and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will not scale exports through episodic devaluations, temporary incentives, or punitive taxation disguised as reform. What is needed is macroeconomic stability, a predictable and competitive exchange rate, affordable energy, rationalised tariffs, a truly zero-rated export regime with automatic refunds, and sustained investment in skills. Until exports are treated as central to economic survival rather than a revenue afterthought, ambitious targets — such as $63bn — will remain out of reach.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Violence Against Hindus: Is Bangladesh Burying Its Founding Ideals Of Secularism And Pluralism?</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/violence-against-hindus-bangladesh-burying-its-founding-ideals-secularism-and-pluralism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For Bangladesh’s Hindus, each funeral deepens the message that their lives are negotiable and their suffering invisible. If this trajectory continues unchecked, the country risks normalizing a culture of impunity that will ultimately consume more than one community. Violence ignored does not fade; it spreads. And the price of silence, as history repeatedly shows, is always paid in lives.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SMOKERS’ CORNER: RELEASING THE PRESSURE</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966347/smokers-corner-releasing-the-pressure</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; Illustration by Abro &quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/69631f7eeca8a.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Illustration by Abro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sentiment that ‘revolution was just around the corner’ serves as a poignant distillation of the 1960s ‘counterculture’ zeitgeist. It was a unique historical moment, where global currents of youthful middle-class dissent converged to create a sense of inevitability that the old order was about to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a distinct sense of melancholy attached to this sentiment today, stemming from the fact that the revolution never actually materialised. The capitalist structures and political hierarchies that drew the fire of youthful protestors proved resilient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The survival of the status quo was largely due to the durability of the modern state. When pushed hard, governments effectively reinforced their ‘law and order’ platforms, a strategy that successfully appealed to a more cautious general public. They prioritised stability over radical change, allowing the state to reassert control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capitalism demonstrated a remarkable capacity to co-opt the rebellion. Instead of being dismantled by the ‘rebellion’, the market absorbed it, rapidly transforming the potent symbols of revolution into mass-produced commodities. This allowed individuals to buy the aesthetic of a revolutionary without ever actually threatening the financial institutions that issued them loans and credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite the political failures of the era’s uprisings, they did usher in some social shifts. As noted by the American sociologist Todd Gitlin, while the movements of the 1960s failed to topple governments, a “cultural revolution” effectively took root, fundamentally altering how society perceives authority, gender roles, racial dynamics and environmental stewardship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the counterculture of the 1960s to today’s ‘Gen Z revolutions’, mass uprisings have repeatedly failed to dismantle power because the modern state has learned how to absorb dissent, co-opt its language and rebrand itself without changing its core&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it is also true that the state gained a sophisticated understanding of how to manage dissent energised by middle-class youth. In the decades that followed, governments learned to neutralise modern, youth-led uprisings by absorbing their energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the American political scientist Christian Davenport, the evolution of state power since the 1970s has seen a sophisticated shift toward the “professionalisation of state survival”, moving away from blunt, reactive force in favour of nuanced containment. Modern states now prioritise strategies of co-optation and absorption, expertly identifying the leaders and aesthetic language of youth movements to bring them into the fold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One way of doing this is by inviting activists into ‘advisory’ committees. This aids the state to effectively dissipate radical energy through institutionalisation. The state then allows for symbolic concessions, such as the resignation of a single unpopular official. This satisfies the activists’ immediate hunger for change but without threatening the underlying power structure. The most recent example in this regard is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1928259&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/695984db0630f.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This management of dissent extends into the digital realm as well. The initial advantage held by youth activists in this area has been increasingly eclipsed by state-directed information management. And anyway, the digital landscape often gets flooded with a clutter of noises, so much so that a movement’s core message becomes diluted or misunderstood by the wider public.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most post-1970s movements have taken on a bourgeoisie character. Therefore, the state strategically exploits the socio-economic stakes that the activists have in the existing system. Dissent has become the specialised vocation of the bourgeoisie. This is why it fails to achieve the critical mass necessary for systemic change. This is why, in most cases now, the state often treats dissent as a pressure valve to be managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 1974 ‘Carnation Revolution’ against a fascist regime in Portugal is remembered as a popular uprising. It really wasn’t. According to the American political scientist Samuel P. Huntington, it was a ‘top-down’ transition initiated by the military. It was a coup d’etat. By leading the change from within, the rebel officers ensured that the transition remained institutional and controlled, effectively neutralising the more revolutionary working class elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This pattern, what Harvard University political scientist Tarek Masoud calls “decapitation without dismantling”, defines the subsequent ‘revolutions’ of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. In these instances, high-visibility, youth-led middle class protests succeeded in removing unpopular leaders, yet the underlying state machinery and power structures remained largely untouched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These uprisings functioned as pressure valves. Examples include 2003’s ‘Rose Revolution’ in Georgia, 2004’s ‘Orange Revolution’ in Ukraine, 2011’s ‘Arab Spring’ (2011), 2022’s ‘Sri Lankan Aragalaya’ and last year’s uprisings in Bangladesh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1941374&quot;&gt;Nepal&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1948680&quot;&gt;Madagascar&lt;/a&gt;. The newest trend in this regard are the so-called ‘Gen Z Revolutions.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These cases prove that, unless an uprising targets the entire administrative and economic infrastructure, the state will simply rebrand itself while maintaining the old power dynamics. Targeting the entire infrastructure hasn’t happened since the revolutions in France (1789), Russia (1917), China (1949), Cuba (1958), Nicaragua (1979) and Iran (1979).&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The American historian Crane Brinton established a rigorous “fever chart” for true revolutions, requiring a progression from the collapse of the old regime to a “Thermidor”, or the consolidation of an entirely new order. In contrast, most modern uprisings fail to reach this final stage. Learning from the upheavals of the 1960s, the state no longer tries to simply crush dissent. It manages it. By allowing an unpopular figurehead to be removed, the state provides a psychological victory to the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uprisings in this regard are better described as pressure valves than revolutions. When the media labels these events as ‘revolutions’, it misses the fact that the underlying power structure is often stronger the day after the uprising than it was the day before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is an excellent example of this. The power structure actually grew stronger after the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1832279&quot;&gt;May 9, 2023&lt;/a&gt; uprising staged by the supporters of the now jailed populist Imran Khan. Such events function as pressure valves because they provide an outlet for the energy of middle-class youth. But this energy fails to crystallise into an actual revolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called ‘Gen Z Revolutions’ will also eventually be absorbed back into the systems they ‘fought’. The old machinery will re-assert itself, often rebranding the same power under the new, popular language of the ‘revolution’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, while the term ‘pressure valve’ might suggest a failure to achieve total victory, this mechanism is arguably more vital to the long term health of a nation than a ‘Thermidorian’ revolution. The true danger of a systemic overthrow is the almost inevitable descent into a reign of terror or a vacuum of power that invites civil war, economic collapse, and permanent instability. Therefore, the preservation of certain deep-rooted instruments of the state are necessary for the survival of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By allowing pressure valves, these instruments allow for a change without destroying the hardware of the state. A society can move towards reform more effectively through incremental institutional change than through a total rupture that risks leaving the society in a state of permanent chaos.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966327/cricket-concerns</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SCHEDULE uncertainty persists at yet another multilateral cricket tournament to be held in South Asia. Once again, it involves India, which has been intent on throwing its weight around. This time, though, it is getting a taste of its own medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a month before the Twenty20 World Cup is set to be played in India and Sri Lanka, Bangladesh have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;cited security reservations&lt;/a&gt; over travelling to India. The Bangladesh Cricket Board is, instead, in a discussion with the International Cricket Council about playing its matches in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its concerns have been triggered on account of worsening Dhaka-New Delhi ties and the recent events related to its fast bowler Mustafizur Rehman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur had been signed by the Indian Premier League side Kolkata Knight Riders, only for the Board of Control for Cricket in India to&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872&quot;&gt; ask the team to release him&lt;/a&gt; due to “recent developments”. The move sparked a furore in Dhaka, which banned the broadcast of the IPL in the country and asked the ICC to shift its World Cup matches from India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its argument is that when India cannot ensure Mustafizur’s safety, the only Bangladeshi played snapped up in the IPL auction, how can it guarantee the security of the entire team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Cup, beginning on Feb 7, is set for geopolitical strains again after Pakistan-India tensions eased with an arrangement which sees both teams play their matches at neutral venues during tournaments held in either country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will play their World Cup games in Sri Lanka, just like India played their Champions Trophy matches in the UAE last year. India has cited security concerns for not sending its team to Pakistan. Now, it has to address Bangladesh’s similar concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is imperative for the ICC, led by former Indian cricket supremo Jay Shah, to make an impartial decision instead of forcing Bangladesh to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘Battle-tested’: Pakistan arms exports surge after May conflict with India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966203/battle-tested-pakistan-arms-exports-surge-after-may-conflict-with-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;During the four-day conflict with India in May last year, Pakistan demonstrated not only the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910987&quot;&gt;effectiveness &lt;/a&gt;of Chinese military hardware, but also its own indigenously produced equipment, like the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1226734&quot;&gt;JF-17 Thunder&lt;/a&gt; fighter jet, the Al-Khalid main battle tank and the Fatah series guided multiple launch rocket system (G-MLRS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In particular, the JF-17‘s role in the May conflict and in the skirmish with India in 2019 proved the jet’s capabilities in battle. During last year’s war with India, the Thunder was credited with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909984&quot;&gt;destroying&lt;/a&gt; the state-of-the-art S-400 surface-to-missile system deployed by India at Adampur. The jet also made a strong showing at last year’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1956309&quot;&gt;Dubai Airshow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965472/absolutely-we-are-ready-asif-says-pakistan-can-confront-aggression-on-eastern-western-borders-simultaneously&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;told &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geo News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a brief timeline of arms deals that Pakistan has finalised or is currently discussing with friendly countries since May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#january-10-2026-iraqi-air-chief-expresses-keen-interest-in-jf-17&quot; id=&quot;january-10-2026-iraqi-air-chief-expresses-keen-interest-in-jf-17&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;January 10, 2026: Iraqi Air Chief expresses ‘keen interest’ in JF-17&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 10, Iraqi Air Force Commander Lt Gen Staff Pilot Mohanad Ghalib Mohammed Radi Al-Asadi praised the Pakistan Air Force’s (PAF) professionalism during the May conflict and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966192/iraqi-air-chief-praises-pafs-professionalism-expresses-keen-interest-in-jf-17-thunder-jets&quot;&gt;expressed interest&lt;/a&gt; in acquiring the battle-proven jets during a visit by PAF Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu to Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Lt Gen Al-Asadi expressed “interest in benefiting from PAF’s world-class training and expressed a keen interest in JF-17 Thunder fighter jets [and] Super Mushshak trainer aircraft”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was reported earlier this week that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert around $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942611/?utm_source=newskit_ai&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;mutual defence pact&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets and that the total deal was worth $4 billion, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#january-6-bangladesh-expresses-interest-in-buying-jf-17s&quot; id=&quot;january-6-bangladesh-expresses-interest-in-buying-jf-17s&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;January 6: Bangladesh expresses interest in buying JF-17s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and Bangladesh’s air chiefs held detailed discussions on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;potential procurement&lt;/a&gt;” of JF-17 Thunder aircraft, ISPR said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Air Chief Marshal Sidhu briefed his Bangladeshi counterpart on the PAF’s recent advancements and reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to supporting the Bangladesh Air Force through a comprehensive training framework from basic to advanced flying and specialised courses across PAF institutions, it said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He also assured fast-tracked delivery of Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, along with a complete training and long-term support ecosystem,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Detailed discussions were also held on the potential procurement of JF-17 Thunder aircraft.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan signed a multi-billion-dollar deal to sell conventional military equipment to the Libyan army last month, entering a select club of countries that export conventional arms and equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A copy of the deal, which was seen by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; before it was finalised, listed the purchase of several JF-17 fighter jets and Super Mushak trainer aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Pakistani official told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the deal included the sale of equipment for land, sea and air, spread over two-and-a-half years, adding it could also include the JF-17 fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Keen observers of international and regional politics will not have missed the tacit presence of the invisible hand of the US in determining the democratic transition in Bangladesh.  Obviously, TarIque had been &lt;em&gt;tutored&lt;/em&gt; by the Americans about the best way forward for the transition towards democratic rule and delivering on the promises of cooperation on regional security. The intelligentsia inside the country could have hoped for Tarique referring to ‘’historical’’ figures from the Indian subcontinent, the Muslim world, and Bangladesh’s past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>JI emir warns against ‘blocking democratic pathways’</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966025/ji-emir-warns-against-blocking-democratic-pathways</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Jamaat-i-Islami Emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has warned the rulers that blocking democratic pathways and branding political dissent as treason will not resolve the country’s deepening crises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The powerful must abandon manipulation through ‘RTS’ and ‘Form-47 tactics’ and stop imposing restrictions on the youth,” he said while addressing the participants of a training camp at Mansoora on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Pakistan is being held hostage by a class that thrives on corruption, oppression, falsehood and injustice. The “imposed elite”, he added, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/608164&quot;&gt;deprived&lt;/a&gt; the nation of basic rights such as education, healthcare and justice. Resisting the obsolete system and its protectors is a fundamental religious obligation, said Mr Rehman, asserting that his part will bring change through the strength of public opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the rulers are fearful of the new generation, particularly Generation Z, and are systematically closing the doors of education and employment on them. He warned that widespread despair among the youth is pushing them toward &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1741126&quot;&gt;drug abuse&lt;/a&gt;. To counter this, he said, Alkhidmat Foundation and JI have expanded the “Bano Qabil” initiative into a comprehensive youth development project called ‘Z-Connect’, aimed at providing education, skills and moral training. “We will not allow our youth to become victims of systemic oppression,” he said, expressing confidence that genuine change would come through public support, especially the younger generation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to Bangladesh, Rehman said the JI there faced decades of brutal repression, with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1257512&quot;&gt;senior leaders executed&lt;/a&gt; and thousands of workers imprisoned under the rule of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman’s daughter, Sheikh Hasina. He said that Sheikh Mujib, along with Gen Yahya Khan and Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, played a central role in the breakup of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rehman said that public resentment against India has grown in Bangladesh. He said Bangladeshi people have set ablaze statues of Sheikh Mujib while Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh, through patience and steadfast struggle, has emerged as a major political force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JI chief urged the participants to avoid sectarianism and cautioned against adopting traditions and customs that contradict the spirit of Islam, calling such practices a form of idolatry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highlighting social injustices, he said denial of women’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955572&quot;&gt;inheritance rights&lt;/a&gt; has become a norm in Pakistan, vowing that the JI would ensure women receive their rightful share.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mustafizur controversy: BCCI on Bangladesh&apos;s request to shift T20WC matches</title>

      <description>BCCI officials met in Mumbai to discuss the Centre of Excellence&apos;s operations and future India U-19 and India A tours. Regarding Bangladesh&apos;s T20 World Cup match venue request, the board stated it&apos;s not their domain, as the ICC holds the final decision. Recruitment for vacant technical positions at the CoE is also a priority.</description>

      <title>FM Dar to head to Saudi Arabia for extraordinary meeting of OIC Council of Foreign Ministers</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966008/fm-dar-to-head-to-saudi-arabia-for-extraordinary-meeting-of-oic-council-of-foreign-ministers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will leave on Friday night for Saudi Arabia to attend an extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Council of Foreign Ministers, scheduled for Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting will discuss the implications of Israel’s recognition of Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The session will address the implications of Israel’s recognition of the so-called Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” read a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiserdeputy-prime-ministerforeign-minister-to-attend-extraordinary-session-of-oic-council-of-foreign-ministers-in-jeddah9-11-january-2026&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt;issued by the Foreign Office (FO) on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said the deputy prime minister will share Pakistan’s position on the issue of Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the sidelines, Dar will also hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from OIC member states to discuss further cooperation on regional and international issues, added the FO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somaliland enjoys a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1802522&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;strategic position&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Gulf of Aden and has its own currency, passport and army, but has struggled to win international recognition, amid fears of provoking Somalia and encouraging other separatist movements in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel became the first country to formally recognise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1878375/somalia-ethiopia-reach-deal-to-end-dispute-over-breakaway-region&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Somaliland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an independent and sovereign state, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965469&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;arrived &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in Somaliland for a high-profile visit, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”, after Israel recognised the breakaway region in the Horn of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and a wide selection of Muslim countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965837&quot;&gt;issued &lt;/a&gt;a joint statement on Thursday condemning the visit by the Israeli diplomat to Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement, issued by the FO, was issued on behalf of the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Gambia, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Türkiye and Yemen, as well as the OIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Pakistan joined 20 other nations and the OIC in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963725&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rejecting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Israel’s recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement underscored their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Mamdani penned the letter in early December after meeting Khalid&apos;s parents, who were visiting the United States in December last year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khalid’s parents shared the letter a few days ago, which has been circulating on social media platforms such as X and Instagram.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Randhir Jaiswal from the external affairs ministry said in a public statement that Mamdani should focus on his own affairs rather than wading into another country&apos;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“On the issue of comments made by the Mayor of New York [City], we expect public representatives to be respectful of the independence of judiciaries in other democracies,” Jaiswal said. “Expressing personal prejudices does not behoove those in office,&quot; he added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Instead of such comments, it would be better to focus on the responsibilities entrusted to them.&quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Student activist Khalid has been held in prison without trial since September 2020, and is accused of being behind the New Delhi riots that took place in February 2020. The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) considers Khalid as being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uscirf.gov/religious-prisoners-conscience/forb-victims-database/umar-khalid&quot;&gt;persecuted&lt;/a&gt; for &quot;protesting religious freedom conditions&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The USCIRF &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.uscirf.gov/news-room/releases-statements/indias-political-system-facilitates-intolerance-towards-religious&quot;&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; designating India as a &quot;Country of Particular Concern&quot; for its intolerance towards religious minorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Khalid was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/A1967-37.pdf&quot;&gt;UAPA&lt;/a&gt;, a law that allows for prolonged detention and makes bail exceptionally difficult.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, India&apos;s Supreme Court rejected Khalid’s bail application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mamdani’s letter to Khalid reads, &quot;Dear Umar, I think of your words on bitterness often and the importance of not letting it consume one&apos;s self. It was a pleasure to meet your parents. We are all thinking of you,&quot; the letter reads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eight US lawmakers also wrote a letter to Indian ambassador Vinay Mohan Kwatra, dated 30 December, urging India to grant Khalid bail and a free trial “in accordance to international law”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democratic Congressman Jim McGovern, who is co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, shared the letter, which was also signed by Democratic Representatives Jamie Raskin, Pramila Jayapal, Jan Schakowsky, Lloyd Doggett and Rashida Tlaib; and Democratic Senators Chris Van Hollen and Peter Welch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McGovern and some of the others had also met Khalid&apos;s parents during their December visit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Modi government changed the citizenship law to expedite citizenship for persecuted Hindus, Parsis, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, and Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hindu right-wing mobs attacked peaceful sit-ins in New Delhi, which precipitated a deadly riot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than 50 people, largely Muslims, were killed. It is perceived to be the most violent episode in New Delhi since the anti-Sikh riots of 1984.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian police arrested more than 2,000 people. The New Delhi Police, accused of bias against Muslims, arrested activists and students, many of them Muslim, accusing them of orchestrating the violence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least 18 student leaders and activists were arrested, including Khalid. Over the past five years, Khalid’s bail applications have been rejected repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International human rights organisations have repeatedly called for his release&lt;a href=&quot;http://release.on&quot;&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;On 5 January, some of the accused were released on bail, but not Khalid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Amnesty International said, “While we welcome the court’s decision to grant bail to their co-accused, it is shameful that Umar Khalid and Sharjeel Imam continue to be denied bail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Neither of these individuals should be in detention in the first place. They have been detained for more than five years without trial on politically motivated allegations - the charges against them should be dropped and their release should be unconditional.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>FM Dar to leave for Saudi Arabia tonight to attend extraordinary meeting of OIC Council of Foreign Ministers</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966008/fm-dar-to-leave-for-saudi-arabia-tonight-to-attend-extraordinary-meeting-of-oic-council-of-foreign-ministers</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar will leave on Friday night for Saudi Arabia to attend an extraordinary meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Council of Foreign Ministers, scheduled for Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting will discuss the implications of Israel’s recognition of Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The session will address the implications of Israel’s recognition of the so-called Somaliland region of the Federal Republic of Somalia,” read a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://mofa.gov.pk/press-releases/curtain-raiserdeputy-prime-ministerforeign-minister-to-attend-extraordinary-session-of-oic-council-of-foreign-ministers-in-jeddah9-11-january-2026&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt;issued by the Foreign Office (FO) on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said the deputy prime minister will share Pakistan’s position on the issue of Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the sidelines, Dar will also hold bilateral meetings with his counterparts from OIC member states to discuss further cooperation on regional and international issues, added the FO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somaliland enjoys a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1802522&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;strategic position&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Gulf of Aden and has its own currency, passport and army, but has struggled to win international recognition, amid fears of provoking Somalia and encouraging other separatist movements in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel became the first country to formally recognise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1878375/somalia-ethiopia-reach-deal-to-end-dispute-over-breakaway-region&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Somaliland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an independent and sovereign state, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965469&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;arrived &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;in Somaliland for a high-profile visit, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”, after Israel recognised the breakaway region in the Horn of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and a wide selection of Muslim countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965837&quot;&gt;issued &lt;/a&gt;a joint statement on Thursday condemning the visit by the Israeli diplomat to Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement, issued by the FO, was issued on behalf of the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Gambia, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Türkiye and Yemen, as well as the OIC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Pakistan joined 20 other nations and the OIC in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963725&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;rejecting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Israel’s recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement underscored their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;span&gt;The lines between India’s foreign policy, domestic politics and economy will become increasingly blurred in 2026 &lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Expert comment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;LToremark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2026-01-09T10:43:15+00:00&quot; title=&quot;Friday, 9 January, 2026&quot;&gt;9 January 2026&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It will become increasingly hard for the Modi government to offset foreign policy setbacks with domestic successes as the full impact of US tariffs starts to bite.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class=&quot;media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;img alt=&quot;alt&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2026-01/2026-01-09-india-in-2026-2229378086.jpg?itok=ptDuQdkZ&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;2025 was arguably India’s most challenging foreign policy year. The four-day &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/05/india-pakistan-ceasefire-remains-shaky-relations-unlikely-return-status-quo&quot; title=&quot;India–Pakistan ceasefire remains shaky, with relations unlikely to return to status quo&quot;&gt;conflict&lt;/a&gt; with Pakistan in May was followed by a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/08/trumps-tariffs-put-strain-us-india-ties-relations-will-endure-long-run&quot; title=&quot;Trump’s tariffs put strain on US–India ties, but relations will endure in the long run &quot;&gt;downturn&lt;/a&gt; in India–US relations. The Trump administration imposed 50 per cent tariffs on India over its purchase of Russian crude and the failure to secure a trade deal by the agreed deadline. Adding insult to injury, Washington increased its outreach to Islamabad. There was also instability in India’s neighbourhood, including the so-called Gen Z protests in Nepal and a downturn in relations with Bangladesh after Sheikh Hasina was removed from power and fled to India in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Modi government sought to downplay these setbacks by pointing to successes on the domestic front, including electoral successes for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party in state elections, economic reforms – including reforms to its &lt;a href=&quot;https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gst-2-0-is-here-what-the-new-tax-reforms-mean-for-you-10-things-to-know/articleshow/124038295.cms&quot;&gt;goods and services tax&lt;/a&gt; and new &lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/policy/india-implements-four-labour-codes-replacing-29-laws-in-biggest-reform-since-independence/articleshow/125482920.cms&quot;&gt;labour codes&lt;/a&gt; &amp;nbsp;– and free trade deals with the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/07/modi-visit-marks-elevation-india-uk-relationship-risks-and-ambiguities-remain&quot; title=&quot; Modi visit marks elevation of India–UK relationship, but risks and ambiguities remain&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt;, Oman and New Zealand. Despite the challenges of US tariffs, India remained the world’s fastest growing major economy, recording &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2209412&amp;amp;reg=3&amp;amp;lang=2&quot;&gt;8.2 per cent&lt;/a&gt; growth between July and September thanks in part to its large domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;align-right embedded-entity embed&quot;&gt;

                  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;h5 teaser__title&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Trump’s tariffs put strain on US–India ties, but relations will endure in the long run &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        
      &lt;/header&gt;

                    
      
              
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, in 2026 the lines between foreign policy, domestic politics and the economy are likely to become increasingly blurred. The latest GDP growth data was before the full force of Trump’s tariffs came into effect, so they will begin to have a more sustained impact on the economy the longer they remain in place. Washington is also considering additional &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/us-president-trump-backs-russian-sanctions-bill-threatening-500-tariff-on-india-for-russian-oil-10507365&quot;&gt;sanctions&lt;/a&gt; on countries doing business with Russia. This economic impact could have a knock-on effect on the country’s politics as India will hold elections in four states and one Union Territory in 2026.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Modi government will be hoping that trade diversion efforts help alleviate some of these pressures. A key watchpoint will be the conclusion of a trade deal with the European Union, India’s leading trade partner. However, the negotiations have been on and off since 2007 and a deadline to conclude a trade deal by the end of last year was missed. Both sides will be seeking to conclude the deal ahead of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s visit to India later this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Summit year&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;India will host a string of summits in 2026, including the AI Impact Summit in February, the BRICS summit and possibly the Quad summit, which was scheduled to take place last year but postponed amid the downturn in India–US relations. India will also be hosting several key world leaders. Following Russian President Vladimir Putin’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/12/putins-india-visit-aims-reaffirm-new-delhi-moscow-relations-just-trump-applies-pressure&quot; title=&quot;Putin’s India visit aims to reaffirm New Delhi–Moscow relations – just as Trump applies pressure to downgrade them&quot;&gt;visit to India&lt;/a&gt; in December, Ursula Von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa will be chief guests at India’s Republic Day parade later this month. Chinese President Xi Jinping may visit India for the BRICS summit, and US President Donald Trump could visit India if the Quad summit goes ahead – and New Delhi and Washington are able to resolve their differences and secure a trade deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While New Delhi will argue these developments vindicate its multi-aligned foreign policy, the cracks in India’s longstanding commitment to strategic autonomy are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore. India’s exclusion from the inaugural &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.state.gov/releases/office-of-the-spokesperson/2025/12/pax-silica-initiative/&quot;&gt;summit &lt;/a&gt;of the Trump administration’s Pax Silica initiative in December was telling. India has long been touted as a beneficiary of the push to de-risk or diversify supply chains away from China but its exclusion from a key initiative on critical and emerging technologies signalled a weakening of this narrative.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India’s absence from the Pax Silica summit partially reflects the bad blood in the India–US relationship and Washington’s aversion to the vagaries of India’s strategic autonomy as it prefers to do business with more reliable partners. But it also shows that India is increasingly viewed as a secondary player in the development of critical and emerging technologies. Although US tech companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft have announced investment &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c3w79pgn8peo&quot;&gt;commitments&lt;/a&gt; in India, much of this is in data centres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This points to several structural challenges facing India in its ambition to become a global manufacturing hub. An example of this can be seen in the semiconductor space. India is an important player in terms of chip design and last year Modi &lt;a href=&quot;https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/cons-products/electronics/made-in-india-chips-to-hit-market-by-2025-end-for-first-time-says-pm-modi/articleshow/123316826.cms&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that India would deliver its first domestically produced chips. However, this will largely focus on less advanced (trailing-edge) chips. Chip production also requires water and electricity – areas where India faces acute shortages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Strategic autonomy under increasing scrutiny&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;India’s careful international balancing act was clear in its response to the US attack on Venezuela. Among BRICS members, India was the least vocal in its response to the attack and the capture of President Nicolás Maduro. Its Ministry of External Affairs issued a brief statement that expressed &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/40566/Press_Release_on_recent_developments_in_Venezuela&quot;&gt;‘deep concern’&lt;/a&gt; about recent developments, while the government’s main focus has been to support and safeguard Indian nationals in Venezuela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;align-left embedded-entity embed&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s muted response partially reflects its limited interests in Venezuela; India has reduced its import of Venezuelan crude in response to Western sanctions on the country. It also reflects a desire to stay on good terms with Washington and secure a trade deal. This echoes New Delhi’s muted response to other global flashpoints, including the conflicts in Gaza (to stay on good terms with Israel) and Ukraine (to stay on good terms with Russia).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, Indian foreign policy can often come across as &lt;a href=&quot;https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/11/26/india-end-strategic-autonomy/?utm_content=gifting&amp;amp;tpcc=gifting_article&amp;amp;gifting_article=aW5kaWEtZW5kLXN0cmF0ZWdpYy1hdXRvbm9teQ%3D%3D&quot;&gt;aloof&lt;/a&gt;. It professes a commitment to the rules-based international order, including principles of sovereignty, territorial integrity and the equality of states, but it is often quiet when it comes to upholding these principles. India claims to be a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mea.gov.in/press-releases.htm?dtl/38161/The_3rd_Voice_of_Global_South_Summit_2024&quot;&gt;‘voice’&lt;/a&gt; of the Global South, but when Venezuela is attacked, its response is slow and silent.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>India and Bangladesh have begun the process to renew a landmark agreement on sharing the waters of the Ganges, as analysts warn political disputes and uncertainty over Dhaka’s general election could complicate talks between the two neighbours.
Officials from both sides have started joint measurements of water levels in the Ganges, or Padma as the river is known in Bangladesh, as part of preparations to renew the agreement signed in 1996 and due to expire in December this year, according to...</description>

      <title>Bangladesh: Where Blasphemy Is A Trigger To Weaponize Religion</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/bangladesh-where-blasphemy-trigger-weaponize-religion</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The ruling governments in Bangladesh often seek to use these laws in various ways. Critical expression, especially criticism of the government or raising questions about religion, can be met with swift arrest and harassment through laws such as the Digital Security Act (DSA). In addition, allegations of religious blasphemy are used to pressure and marginalize political opponents, opposition parties, and dissenting voices. Religious extremist groups use these laws to promote their ideology or to intimidate people of different faiths or those who hold non-religious views.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Visa sections of 3 Bangladesh missions in India closed on security grounds</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965986/visa-sections-of-3-bangladesh-missions-in-india-closed-on-security-grounds</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The visa sections of three Bangladesh missions in India have been closed temporarily on security grounds, Foreign Affairs Adviser Touhid Hossain said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I have done is that I have asked our three missions to keep their visa sections closed for the time being. It’s a security issue,” he told reporters at the foreign ministry, responding to a question on whether Bangladesh missions in India had restricted tourist visas for Indians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He did not name the missions. However, diplomatic sources said the visa sections of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi, the Deputy High Commission in Kolkata, and the Bangladesh Assistant High Commission in Agartala have been closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visa sections at Bangladesh missions in Chennai and Mumbai, however, remain operational, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few weeks, protests have taken place near Bangladesh missions in India.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the ouster of the Awami League regime, the Indian High Commission restricted tourist visas to Bangladeshis, citing security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Touhid was also asked about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964965&quot;&gt;dropping &lt;/a&gt;of Bangladeshi cricketer Mustafizur Rahman from the Indian Premier League amid anti-Bangladesh protests in India, and Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965735/bangladesh-says-icc-considering-request-to-move-their-world-cup-games-from-india&quot;&gt;decision &lt;/a&gt;not to send the national cricket team to India for the upcoming T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The adviser said he fully supported Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul’s stance on not sending the team to India for safety reasons and demanding that Bangladesh’s matches be relocated to co-host Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will certainly play outside India,” Touhid said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that both players and supporters would have to travel to India and said the government must consider their security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the impact on bilateral relations, Touhid said such issues arise from time to time and each has some impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Bangladesh would take decisions based on its national interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have an interest in our players’ safety in not sending them to India. If we have interest in buying rice from India, we will buy it,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The Indian government is monitoring the Bangladesh situation regarding the T20 World Cup and will follow its sports policy of welcoming all participating nations. Bangladesh&apos;s decision to withdraw or relocate matches remains solely theirs, with India awaiting their final stance. Unlike Pakistan, where a specific sports policy exists, Bangladesh will receive full security if they choose to participate.</description>

      <title>Hafiz Naeem warns of simmering public anger</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965885/hafiz-naeem-warns-of-simmering-public-anger</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Jamaat-i-Islami Emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has warned that if the ruling elite continue to sustain the oppressive system and deny people their democratic right, public anger will erupt with consequences the powerful will be unable to contain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to the media after addressing the concluding ceremony of Bukhari Sharif at Jamia Markaz Uloom-e-Islamia on Thursday, Rehman demanded the establishment of a genuinely empowered local government system and the removal of all restrictions on democratic freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the country’s youth were being pushed into despair as access to education and employment continued to shrink, while electricity, gas and fuel prices were rising relentlessly. He criticised what he termed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1278512&quot;&gt;decaying judicial system&lt;/a&gt;, further weakened by amendments that had tightened the elite’s control, and said the economy remained trapped in an interest-based framework that benefitted only a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Referring to the newly-introduced local government law in Punjab, he called it a black law imposed at a time when people were already struggling to survive. He said JI considered resistance against this unjust and exploitative system a national and moral obligation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Rehman cautioned rulers to read the situation carefully and address people’s grievances, warning that once public frustration turns into open revolt, force and weapons would not be able to suppress it. “When lawful avenues are blocked, people are pushed towards unlawful means,” he said, urging authorities to respect public opinion and restore people’s rightful voice in governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also criticised Pakistan’s ruling circles for their eagerness to seek the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963690&quot;&gt;favour &lt;/a&gt;of US President Donald Trump, despite his role in advancing a new colonial order, providing blanket protection to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu despite international court rulings, and actions against Venezuela’s leadership. He said Pakistan’s rulers must represent the aspirations of their own people instead of seeking foreign approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JI chief, earlier, urged religious scholars and students to rise above sectarian differences and unite the Ummah on common principles. He emphasised that spreading knowledge, strengthening outreach to ordinary people and accelerating the struggle for the establishment of Deen were among the most noble traditions of Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaffirming JI’s commitment to peaceful political resistance, Mr Rehman cited the example of JI Bangladesh, saying that despite severe repression under Sheikh Hasina’s rule, steadfast and patient struggle ultimately forced the dictator to flee. He also referred to the resistance of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood as examples of resilience against oppression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Jamaat-e-Islami Pakistan stands firmly with the people and will continue to raise its voice for their rights,” he said, adding that the struggle for the supremacy of a just and rightful system would be intensified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Saar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965469&quot;&gt;arrived &lt;/a&gt;in Somaliland for a high-profile visit, condemned by Somalia as an “unauthorised incursion”, after Israel recognised the breakaway region in the Horn of Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement, issued by the Foreign Office (FO) today, was issued on behalf of the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Gambia, Indonesia, Iran, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Maldives, Nigeria, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sudan, Türkiye and Yemen, as well as the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It recalled the earlier statement condemning Israeli recognition and “expressed strong condemnation” of the Israeli FM’s visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The said visit constitutes a clear violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and undermines established international norms and the United Nations Charter,” the joint statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ForeignOfficePk/status/2009308304904712666&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It reaffirmed the 22 countries’ unwavering support for the sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity of Somalia and highlighted that “encouraging secessionist agendas are unacceptable and risk exacerbating tensions in an already fragile region”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Respect for international law, non-interference in [the] internal affairs of sovereign states, and adherence to diplomatic norms are essential for regional and international stability,” the joint statement added, commending Somalia’s commitment to peaceful international engagement, constructive diplomacy and international law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement expressed the 22 countries’ commitment “in continuing to support diplomatic and legal measures taken by Somalia to safeguard its sovereignty, territorial integrity and stability in line with international law”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further stressed that Israel should respect Somalia’s sovereignty, national unity and territorial integrity and honour its obligations in compliance with international law, further demanding that Tel Aviv immediately revoke its recognition of Somaliland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somaliland enjoys a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1802522&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;strategic position&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Gulf of Aden and has its own currency, passport and army, but has struggled to win international recognition, amid fears of provoking Somalia and encouraging other separatist movements in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Israel became the first country to formally recognise &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1878375/somalia-ethiopia-reach-deal-to-end-dispute-over-breakaway-region&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Somaliland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as an independent and sovereign state, with Somaliland’s president, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, saying his state will join the Abraham Accords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Pakistan joined 20 other nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963725&quot;&gt;rejecting&lt;/a&gt; Israel‘s recognition of the self-declared Republic of Somaliland, with a joint statement saying that Tel Aviv’s measure reflected its “full and blatant disregard for international law”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint statement underscored their “unequivocal rejection” of Israel’s recognition of the ‘Somaliland’ region of Somalia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that given the serious repercussions of such an unprecedented measure on peace and security in the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea, and its serious effects on international peace and security as a whole, the move also “reflects Israel’s full and blatant disregard for international law”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh&apos;s interim government has temporarily suspended visa services at its key diplomatic missions in India, including New Delhi, citing &quot;security concerns.&quot; This move follows similar restrictions by India on Bangladeshi nationals.

      <title>Bangladesh air chief discusses enhancing defence cooperation in meetings with CDF Munir, naval chief</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965824/bangladesh-air-chief-discusses-enhancing-defence-cooperation-in-meetings-with-cdf-munir-naval-chief</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The air chief of Bangladesh on Thursday discussed avenues for enhancing defence cooperation with Pakistan in separate meetings with Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) and Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, and Chief of the Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh Air Force Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Hasan Mahmood Khan called on CDF Munir at the General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7579&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the meeting, matters of mutual interest, regional security dynamics and avenues for enhancing bilateral defence and military cooperation were discussed,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Both sides underscored the importance of strengthening professional collaboration, training exchanges and defence ties between the Armed Forces of Pakistan and Bangladesh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the ISPR, ACM Khan lauded the “professionalism of Pakistan Armed Forces and appreciated their contributions towards regional peace and stability”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CDF Munir reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to fostering enduring defence relations with Bangladesh. The ISPR said the meeting reflected the “longstanding and strong bonds between the two brotherly countries”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, ACM Khan called on Admiral Ashraf at the Naval Headquarters in Islamabad, the ISPR &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://ispr.gov.pk/press-release-detail?id=7578&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“​During the meeting, matters of mutual professional interest, evolving regional security paradigm, and avenues for further strengthening bilateral defence cooperation were discussed,” the ISPR said about their meeting as well.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​ACM Khan “acknowledged the high professional standards of Pakistan Navy and expressed his desire to enhance collaboration between the two brotherly nations’ armed forces”, the ISPR said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The dignitaries agreed on the importance of increasing the frequency of high-level exchanges and joint training exercises to foster greater synergy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The naval chief highlighted the Pakistan Navy’s commitment to regional maritime peace and stability through its various initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bangladeshi air chief is leading a high-level defence delegation during his visit to Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He met with his Pakistani counterpart on Tuesday, wherein both air chiefs held detailed discussions on the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;potential procurement&lt;/a&gt;” of JF-17 Thunder aircraft, ISPR said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;​The ISPR highlighted that ACM Khan’s visit underscored the “deepening defence ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh, following the significant” &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1954868/navy-chief-concludes-milestone-visit-to-bangladesh-meets-senior-military-leadership&quot;&gt;visit of Admiral Ashraf&lt;/a&gt; to Dhaka in November 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his visit to Bangladesh, Admiral Ashraf had met with Dhaka’s senior military leadership and discussed avenues to bolster defence cooperation, the Navy had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It had termed his trip, which also encompassed visits to the National Defence College and the Bangladesh Naval Academy, a “milestone”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The defining feature of her public life, however, was one of the world’s longest-running and most bitter political feuds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more than three decades Zia and her rival, &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheikh_Hasina&quot;&gt;Sheikh Hasina&lt;/a&gt; – now exiled in India following her resignation after a violent uprising in mid-2024 – contested the leadership of the south Asian nation, and sought to eclipse the other when in office.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/08/khaleda-zia-obituary&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Direct Bangladesh-Pakistan flights to resume after 14 years</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965805/direct-bangladesh-pakistan-flights-to-resume-after-14-years</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh and Pakistan are to resume direct flights after more than a decade, Dhaka’s national airline said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biman Bangladesh Airlines is scheduled to fly its first Dhaka-Karachi flight on January 29 and will be operated twice weekly, the first regular flights since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are relaunching the Dhaka-Karachi route with two weekly flights,” airline manager Bosra Islam told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The resumption of direct flights will significantly improve connectivity between Bangladesh and Pakistan, supporting business travel, tourism, and family reunions,” Biman Bangladesh Airlines said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Travellers between Bangladesh and Pakistan must currently use connecting flights through Gulf hubs such as Dubai and Doha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cargo ships had resumed sailing from Karachi to Bangladesh’s key port of Chittagong in November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963937&quot;&gt;expressed &lt;/a&gt;the hope that direct flights between Karachi and Dhaka would start in January, during a meeting with the Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during the rule of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, relations between the two countries improved markedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq travelled to Dhaka for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964271&quot;&gt;funeral &lt;/a&gt;of the country’s first female prime minister Khaleda Zia in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2025, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had also visitd Dhaka and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1936871/fm-dar-meets-bangladeshs-yunus-during-historic-visit-as-revitalising-saarc-comes-under-focus&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;met&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yunus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Pakistan&apos;s defence minister claims a surge in aircraft orders, potentially ending IMF reliance within six months. This follows a military standoff with India and discussions with Bangladesh and Saudi Arabia for JF-17 fighter jet deals. The Pak minister expressed strong confidence in these orders materializing, suggesting a significant boost to Pakistan&apos;s economy.</description>

      <title>Trump&apos;s sphere of influence gambit is sloppy, self-sabotage</title>
      <link>https://responsiblestatecraft.org/trump-spheres-of-influence/</link>
      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://responsiblestatecraft.org/media-library/trump-venezuela.jpg?id=62682151&amp;amp;width=2000&amp;amp;height=1162&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C169%2C0%2C2&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spheres of influence stem from the very nature of states and international relations. States will always seek to secure their interests by exerting influence over their neighbors, and the more powerful the state, the greater the influence that it will seek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, sphere of influence strategies vary greatly, on spectrums between relative moderation and excess, humanity and cruelty, discreet pressure and open intimidation, and intelligence and stupidity; and the present policies of the Trump administration in the Western Hemisphere show disturbing signs of inclining towards the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/december-2-1823-seventh-annual-message-monroe-doctrine&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Monroe Doctrine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; too has varied greatly in the two centuries since it was first announced as core to U.S. foreign and security policy. Originally, it was no more than the stated determination to prevent Spain from re-establishing its imperial rule over its former colonies, or Britain and France taking them over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, the previous determination to exclude foreign empires morphed into a determination to prevent states in the Western Hemisphere from joining hostile military and political alliances; or if Washington was forced to concede this (as in the case of Cuba), to cripple the states concerned through economic sanctions and subversion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This longstanding U.S. strategy renders absurd the NATO and European line concerning Ukraine that “every country has the right to choose its international alliances,” and that no other country has a veto over this. And of course, this rule extends far beyond the U.S. and Latin America, or Russia and Ukraine. Whatever its legal or moral “right,” Vietnam would be very ill-advised to join a military alliance with the U.S. against China, as would Bangladesh if it joined a Chinese alliance against India. Or as one Kazakh official once told me when the U.S. was seeking a security relationship with his country, “Every sensible Kazakh has a map in his head; and what that map shows is that Russia is there, and China is there, and Kazakhstan is in the middle. And the U.S. is not on that map.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implacable U.S. goal of preventing a hostile military presence in the Americas has been pursued by both Republican and Democratic administrations; and though the result for populations in the region was often monstrous oppression and suffering, this strategy did succeed in excluding potential military adversaries from America’s neighborhood. No Latin American government today is dreaming of inviting the Chinese or Russians to establish bases on their territories. Nor would Beijing and Moscow accept such an invitation. For they all know very well how ferocious and overwhelming would be the U.S. response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has not prevented actors in the U.S. from repeatedly using an alleged Soviet/Russian/Chinese threat to argue U.S. policies that they have in fact sought for quite different reasons. The single most dreadful example of this was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=32372#:~:text=Examines%20the%20impact%20and%20role,land%20held%20by%20United%20Fruit.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;role&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the United Fruit Company and its allies in the Eisenhower administration in creating the 1954 coup in Guatemala in order to block a moderate land reform, leading to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Guatemala/Civil-war-years&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;civil war&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which tens of thousands of indigenous Maya people were &lt;a href=&quot;https://hmh.org/library/research/genocide-in-guatemala-guide/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;slaughtered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S.-backed military regime in what would today undoubtedly be called a “genocide.” The parallel with Trump’s desire that U.S. corporations should develop Venezuela’s oil is all too obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, a non-existent “alliance” between the Venezuelan regime and China is being used as an excuse for the overthrow of that regime; and the feral hostility of the Cuba emigre lobby and its representatives in the U.S. administration to the existing Cuban state has nothing to do with any real security threat from Cuba, and everything with their own inherited hatreds and ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much further will the Trump administration go? The “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/06/world/video/what-is-the-donroe-doctrine-digvid-vrtc&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Donroe Doctrine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” explicitly returns to the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/roosevelt-corollary-to-monroe-doctrine/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Roosevelt Corollary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” of 1904 that expanded the Monroe Doctrine to assert the U.S. right to exercise “international police power” to intervene in the internal affairs of Latin American states if they show “chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far however, while Trump has declared that the U.S. will “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9enjeey3go&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;run Venezuela&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” he has stopped short of previous U.S. administrations of the first half of the 20th century in that he has not sought to invade and occupy Venezuela. Instead, the kidnapping of President Maduro seems intended to frighten the existing Venezuelan regime into submitting to Trump’s will, especially when it comes to U.S. control of Venezuela’s oil; not just for profit, but for leverage against Russia and China. By cutting off much of Cuba’s oil imports, it might also enable the U.S. to starve Cuba into surrender, allowing Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s relatives to return “home” and regain the property that they lost in the Cuban Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem about trying to run client regimes in this way is: What do you do if they threaten to collapse? This is the dilemma that the U.S. faced in Vietnam, in Iran in 1979, and in Afghanistan by 2020, and the Soviet Union faced in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan, and Russia faced in Ukraine in 2014. Double down or quit? That is to say, allow your clients to collapse, with the resulting damage to your interests and your “credibility,” or send in your own troops to try to ensure their survival?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the great majority of cases where the U.S. has chosen the latter course, the results have been disastrous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one critical instance, the official statements of the Trump administration go much further than the Roosevelt Corollary, which begins with “It is not true that the United States feels any land hunger…as regards the other nations of the Western Hemisphere” (though this would have come as a surprise to the Spanish and Panamanians). Trump and senior Trump officials by contrast have repeatedly emphasised their desire to annex &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0zg974v1o&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greenland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and (less seriously) &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/7282450/trump-annex-canada-economy-recession-upholding-the-constitution/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Canada&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And Canada and Denmark are neither enemies nor dysfunctional dictatorships, but successful democracies and the closest of U.S. allies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump and his team should take note of the Danish prime minister’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/post/204933/donald-trump-greenland-nato-danish-prime-minister&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;warning&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that a seizure of Greenland would “end NATO.” They should also look at how the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 destroyed any chance of continued Russian influence over Ukraine; and how China’s demand for the whole of the South China Sea frightened all of its neighbors, including ones previously well-disposed towards China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China drove its neighbors into Washington’s arms. Trump risks driving America’s neighbors into the arms of China. The Trump administration also needs to remember that U.S. economic influence in Latin America is vastly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-influence-latin-america-argentina-brazil-venezuela-security-energy-bri&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reduced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. was by far the greatest trading partner and investor in South America. Now it is China, which has also greatly increased its role in Central America. This gives countries significant opportunities to resist U.S. economic pressure; and if the U.S. tries to destroy their increasingly vital economic ties with China, it will create a backlash that will undermine or even destroy its sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is an issue of diplomatic tone. It has often been said, and rightly, that Russia weakened its influence over its neighbors by the bullying tone in which its officials often stated Russian demands. Even Russian officials at their worst however would be hard put to match the coarse, smirking &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/atrupar/status/2008318519142686860?s=20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;arrogance of Stephen Miller&lt;/a&gt; on the subject of the U.S. demand for Greenland. Miller clearly sees himself as an old-style imperialist. He should read a real old imperialist, Rudyard Kipling:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If, drunk with sight of power, we loose&lt;br /&gt;Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,&lt;br /&gt;Such boastings as the Gentiles use,&lt;br /&gt;Or lesser breeds without the Law—&lt;br /&gt;Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,&lt;br /&gt;Lest we forget—lest we forget!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Kipling, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46780/recessional&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Recessional&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

The single most dreadful example of this was the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=32372#:~:text=Examines%20the%20impact%20and%20role,land%20held%20by%20United%20Fruit.&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;role&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the United Fruit Company and its allies in the Eisenhower administration in creating the 1954 coup in Guatemala in order to block a moderate land reform, leading to a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.britannica.com/place/Guatemala/Civil-war-years&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;civil war&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in which tens of thousands of indigenous Maya people were &lt;a href=&quot;https://hmh.org/library/research/genocide-in-guatemala-guide/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;slaughtered&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by the U.S.-backed military regime in what would today undoubtedly be called a “genocide.” The parallel with Trump’s desire that U.S. corporations should develop Venezuela’s oil is all too obvious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, a non-existent “alliance” between the Venezuelan regime and China is being used as an excuse for the overthrow of that regime; and the feral hostility of the Cuba emigre lobby and its representatives in the U.S. administration to the existing Cuban state has nothing to do with any real security threat from Cuba, and everything with their own inherited hatreds and ambitions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much further will the Trump administration go? The “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/06/world/video/what-is-the-donroe-doctrine-digvid-vrtc&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Donroe Doctrine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” explicitly returns to the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://teachingamericanhistory.org/document/roosevelt-corollary-to-monroe-doctrine/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Roosevelt Corollary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” of 1904 that expanded the Monroe Doctrine to assert the U.S. right to exercise “international police power” to intervene in the internal affairs of Latin American states if they show “chronic wrongdoing, or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far however, while Trump has declared that the U.S. will “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9enjeey3go&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;run Venezuela&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,” he has stopped short of previous U.S. administrations of the first half of the 20th century in that he has not sought to invade and occupy Venezuela. Instead, the kidnapping of President Maduro seems intended to frighten the existing Venezuelan regime into submitting to Trump’s will, especially when it comes to U.S. control of Venezuela’s oil; not just for profit, but for leverage against Russia and China. By cutting off much of Cuba’s oil imports, it might also enable the U.S. to starve Cuba into surrender, allowing Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s relatives to return “home” and regain the property that they lost in the Cuban Revolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem about trying to run client regimes in this way is: What do you do if they threaten to collapse? This is the dilemma that the U.S. faced in Vietnam, in Iran in 1979, and in Afghanistan by 2020, and the Soviet Union faced in Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Afghanistan, and Russia faced in Ukraine in 2014. Double down or quit? That is to say, allow your clients to collapse, with the resulting damage to your interests and your “credibility,” or send in your own troops to try to ensure their survival?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the great majority of cases where the U.S. has chosen the latter course, the results have been disastrous. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In one critical instance, the official statements of the Trump administration go much further than the Roosevelt Corollary, which begins with “It is not true that the United States feels any land hunger…as regards the other nations of the Western Hemisphere” (though this would have come as a surprise to the Spanish and Panamanians). Trump and senior Trump officials by contrast have repeatedly emphasised their desire to annex &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0zg974v1o&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greenland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and (less seriously) &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/7282450/trump-annex-canada-economy-recession-upholding-the-constitution/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Canada&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And Canada and Denmark are neither enemies nor dysfunctional dictatorships, but successful democracies and the closest of U.S. allies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trump and his team should take note of the Danish prime minister’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://newrepublic.com/post/204933/donald-trump-greenland-nato-danish-prime-minister&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;warning&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that a seizure of Greenland would “end NATO.” They should also look at how the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 destroyed any chance of continued Russian influence over Ukraine; and how China’s demand for the whole of the South China Sea frightened all of its neighbors, including ones previously well-disposed towards China. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China drove its neighbors into Washington’s arms. Trump risks driving America’s neighbors into the arms of China. The Trump administration also needs to remember that U.S. economic influence in Latin America is vastly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/china-influence-latin-america-argentina-brazil-venezuela-security-energy-bri&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reduced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the 20th century, the U.S. was by far the greatest trading partner and investor in South America. Now it is China, which has also greatly increased its role in Central America. This gives countries significant opportunities to resist U.S. economic pressure; and if the U.S. tries to destroy their increasingly vital economic ties with China, it will create a backlash that will undermine or even destroy its sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, there is an issue of diplomatic tone. It has often been said, and rightly, that Russia weakened its influence over its neighbors by the bullying tone in which its officials often stated Russian demands. Even Russian officials at their worst however would be hard put to match the coarse, smirking &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/atrupar/status/2008318519142686860?s=20&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;arrogance of Stephen &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Miller on the subject of the U.S. demand for Greenland. Miller clearly sees himself as an old-style imperialist. He should read a real old imperialist, Rudyard Kipling:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If, drunk with sight of power, we loose&lt;br /&gt;Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,&lt;br /&gt;Such boastings as the Gentiles use,&lt;br /&gt;Or lesser breeds without the Law—&lt;br /&gt;Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,&lt;br /&gt;Lest we forget—lest we forget!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Kipling, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46780/recessional&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Recessional&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump&apos;s sphere of influence quest is sloppy, self-sabotage</title>

      <description>&lt;img src=&quot;https://responsiblestatecraft.org/media-library/trump-venezuela.jpg?id=62682151&amp;amp;width=2000&amp;amp;height=1162&amp;amp;coordinates=0%2C169%2C0%2C2&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spheres of influence stem from the very nature of states and international relations. States will always seek to secure their interests by exerting influence over their neighbors, and the more powerful the state, the greater the influence that it will seek. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That said, sphere of influence strategies vary greatly, on spectrums between relative moderation and excess, humanity and cruelty, discreet pressure and open intimidation, and intelligence and stupidity; and the present policies of the Trump administration in the Western Hemisphere show disturbing signs of inclining towards the latter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://millercenter.org/the-presidency/presidential-speeches/december-2-1823-seventh-annual-message-monroe-doctrine&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Monroe Doctrine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; too has varied greatly in the two centuries since it was first announced as core to U.S. foreign and security policy. Originally, it was no more than the stated determination to prevent Spain from re-establishing its imperial rule over its former colonies, or Britain and France taking them over. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the Cold War, the previous determination to exclude foreign empires morphed into a determination to prevent states in the Western Hemisphere from joining hostile military and political alliances; or if Washington was forced to concede this (as in the case of Cuba), to cripple the states concerned through economic sanctions and subversion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This longstanding U.S. strategy renders absurd the NATO and European line concerning Ukraine that “every country has the right to choose its international alliances,” and that no other country has a veto over this. And of course, this rule extends far beyond the U.S. and Latin America, or Russia and Ukraine. Whatever its legal or moral “right,” Vietnam would be very ill-advised to join a military alliance with the U.S. against China, as would Bangladesh if it joined a Chinese alliance against India. Or as one Kazakh official once told me when the U.S. was seeking a security relationship with his country, “Every sensible Kazakh has a map in his head; and what that map shows is that Russia is there, and China is there, and Kazakhstan is in the middle. And the U.S. is not on that map.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implacable U.S. goal of preventing a hostile military presence in the Americas has been pursued by both Republican and Democratic administrations; and though the result for populations in the region was often monstrous oppression and suffering, this strategy did succeed in excluding potential military adversaries from America’s neighborhood. No Latin American government today is dreaming of inviting the Chinese or Russians to establish bases on their territories. Nor would Beijing and Moscow accept such an invitation. For they all know very well how ferocious and overwhelming would be the U.S. response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has not prevented actors in the U.S. from repeatedly using an alleged Soviet/Russian/Chinese threat to argue U.S. policies that they have in fact sought for quite different reasons.

      <title>Remittances: boon or bane?</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965744/remittances-boon-or-bane</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;CONCERNS are often expressed about the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1960238&quot;&gt;expanding&lt;/a&gt; role of workers’ remittances in the ec­­onomy. They typically focus on the perceived risks of brain drain, excessive consumption, imp­ort leakage, exchange-rate overvaluation and the possibility of Dutch Disease. In contrast, empirical evidence shows that remittances contribute substantially to socioeconomic development. A stable source of external inflows, they help build foreign-exchange buffers, reduce dependence on external borrowing, support financial sector deepening and enhance macroeconomic stability by easing pressure on the current account. They play a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963602&quot;&gt;critical&lt;/a&gt; role in poverty reduction, narrowing income inequalities and strengthening human capital by financing education, healthcare and housing. In times of economic stress, they are vital lifelines for households.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also evidence of skill upgrading among those preparing to migrate and among returnees, resulting in brain gain effects. Studies show that overseas job opportunities have encouraged the Philippines to train more nurses and India to produce more computer scientists, actually increasing the stock of skilled workers at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Misconceptions about remittances largely stem from the way workers’ remittances are treated statistically and methodologically under WTO’s General Agreement on Trade in Services and IMF’s Balance of Payments (BOP) framework. GATS classifies services according to the service provider’s nationality. Under Mode 4, a service supplier is considered foreign, irrespective of the duration of stay abroad. But the IMF defines workers’ services on a residency basis. If an individual lives abroad for over a year, he/she is treated as the host country’s resident, and transactions between residents are excluded from exports of services in the current account, being recorded, instead, under secondary income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOP treatment also creates inconsistencies with System of National Accounts, under which gross national savings consist of: a) gross domestic savings — household, corporate and public-sector savings; b) net transfers from abroad. In FY2025, Pakistan’s gross national savings amounted to 14.1 per cent of GDP, and gross domestic savings only 6.3pc. With net foreign savings positive, reflected in a current-account surplus of 0.5pc of GDP, a substantial share of domestic investment was effectively financed by savings of overseas Pakistanis. Recognising this gap, a UN technical subgroup on the movement of persons is working to integrate BOP services accounts with remittances for a more complete representation of workers’ services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Absorbing new labour force entrants domestically is increasingly difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conceptually, Pakistan’s labour market can be segmented in the same way as goods markets — one serving international and the other domestic demand. If labour services exports are added to other service exports using the GATS framework, our total export of goods and services would amount to around $79 billion rather than $41bn under the IMF’s definition, without altering the overall current-account balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is useful to examine the main concerns regarding remittances more closely. First, the issue of brain drain. Pakistan adds nearly two million new entrants to its labour force each year; around half migrate. Available data indicates that only 2.6pc of the 832,000 migrants are highly qualified and 5.3pc highly skilled. Despite this outflow, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957383&quot;&gt;unemployment&lt;/a&gt; and underemployment continue to rise. Graduate unemployment is estimated to range between 23 and 33pc. If labour supply were genuinely shrinking, real wages should have increased. Instead, studies over the past decade show a decline in real wages across all categories, with the sharpest among degree holders. Notably, during Covid, when migration slowed, real wages showed upward movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given Pakistan’s large youth population, absorbing new labour force entrants domestically is increasingly difficult under current growth trends. In contrast, aging economies such as Japan, Korea and Germany face rising dependency ratios and labour shortages. So, it’s natural for labour-surplus countries to supply manpower to labour-deficient economies. Our policy response should focus on negotiating country-specific labour agreements and aligning training programmes with overseas demand. This requires investment in technical, vocational, language, and lifestyle skills besides work discipline and ethics. International accreditation from recognised institutions such as City &amp;amp; Guilds should be pursued and professionals encouraged to qualify through international exams in engineering, medicine, IT, accountancy and architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, evidence doesn’t support concerns that remittance-receiving households indulge in excessive consumption and stimulate imports. Surveys and field observations show that recipients invest in better education for their children, improved nutrition, immunisation, and healthcare; switch to cleaner cooking fuels; upgrade housing conditions; and improve access to electricity and potable water. These changes lead to better social indicators, reduced poverty, and narrower income differentials. Districts such as Jhe­lum, Chakwal, and Rawalpindi — major sources of overseas workers — now rank high in literacy, school enrolment, and poverty reduction. Food expenditure accounts for about 40pc of total household spending, while a significant share of remittances goes towards housing improvements, farmland, real estate and consumer durables. Many returnees from GCC countries use their capital and skills to establish small businesses, contributing to domestic economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, remittances are often blamed for exchange-rate appreciation through the Dutch Disease effect. However, Dutch Disease arises from unearned rents or windfall gains from natural resources rather than incomes earned through labour services’ export. Evidence doesn’t support this concern. In FY2025, remittances increased by 22pc, yet the exchange rate was stable and foreign-exchange reserves increased. Similarly, Bangladesh has not experienced a sustained loss of export competitiveness despite rising remittance inflows. Exchange-rate appreciation occurs primarily when reserve accumulation is not sterilised, leading to the monetary base’s expansion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, studies indicate that remittances do not have a significant or sustained impact on domestic inflation. The outcome depends largely on country-specific economic structures. Gains in small-scale agriculture and livestock can expand supply and offset demand pressures. As households rise above the poverty line, increased consumption is directed primarily at domestically produced goods — meat, milk, poultry, fruit, vegetables — rather than imports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, import demand is driven mainly by structural and policy-induced constraints rather than remittance inflows. These include deindustrialisation; failure to develop base industries that supply raw materials to downstream sectors; inefficient allocation of natural gas towards domestic consumption instead of industrial use; excessive protection through high tariffs; inability to save nearly $10bn annually by substituting imports of food and cotton; overregulation and excessive taxation; and underinvestment in agricultural research and development.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladesh&apos;s government has hardened its stance on playing the T20 World Cup in India, citing national dignity and cricketer security concerns. Dhaka will urge the ICC to relocate their matches to Sri Lanka, believing the global body misunderstands the gravity of the situation.

      <title>Pakistan, Saudi in talks on JF-17 jets-for-loans deal: Reuters report</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965650/pakistan-saudi-in-talks-on-jf-17-jets-for-loans-deal-reuters-report</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and Saudi Arabia are in talks to convert about $2 billion of Saudi loans into a JF-17 fighter jet deal, two Pakistani sources said, deepening military cooperation months after the two nations signed a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942611/?utm_source=newskit_ai&quot;&gt;mutual defence pact&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talks underscore how the two allies are moving to operationalise defence cooperation at a time of acute financial strain and as Saudi Arabia is reshaping its security partnerships to hedge against uncertainty about US commitments in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mutual defence deal was signed following Israel’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1940759&quot;&gt;strikes &lt;/a&gt;on what it said were Hamas targets in Doha, an attack that shook the Gulf region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the sources said the discussions were limited to the provision of JF-17 Thunder fighter jets, the light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan, while the second said the jets were the primary option among others under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first source said the total deal was worth $4bn, with an additional $2bn to be spent on equipment over and above the loan conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sources close to the military with knowledge of the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s Air Chief Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu was in Saudi Arabia for bilateral talks, including on “military cooperation between the two sides”, Saudi media outlet &lt;em&gt;SaudiNews50&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/SaudiNews50/status/2008608443943518656&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;on social media platform X on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#tested-in-combat&quot; id=&quot;tested-in-combat&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Tested in combat&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amir Masood, a retired air marshal and analyst, said Pakistan was in talks about or had finalised deals with six countries to provide equipment, including JF-17s and electronic and weapons systems for the jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said those countries included Saudi Arabia, but could not confirm any details about the negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JF-17’s marketability has been increased because “it is tested and has been used in combat,” he told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, adding that it’s also cost-effective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aircraft was deployed during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials&quot;&gt;conflict with India&lt;/a&gt; last May, the heaviest fighting between the neighbours in decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The military or finance and defence ministries did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;Reuters’&lt;/em&gt; requests for comment. Saudi Arabia’s government media office also did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mutual defence pact, signed in September, committed both sides to treat any aggression against either country as an attack on both, significantly deepening a decades-old security partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has long provided military support to the kingdom, including training and advisory deployments, while Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stepped in to support Pakistan financially during periods of economic stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Riyadh announced a $6bn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1440974&quot;&gt;support package&lt;/a&gt; for Pakistan, including a $3bn deposit at the central bank and $3bn worth of oil supplies on deferred payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959240&quot;&gt;rolled over&lt;/a&gt; deposits multiple times, including a $1.2bn deferment last year, helping Islamabad stabilise its foreign exchange reserves amid chronic balance-of-payments pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#arms-sales-outreach&quot; id=&quot;arms-sales-outreach&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Arms sales outreach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has in recent months stepped up defence outreach as it seeks to expand arms exports and monetise its domestic defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Islamabad &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962754&quot;&gt;struck &lt;/a&gt;a weapons deal worth more than $4bn with Libya’s eastern-based Libyan National Army, officials said, one of the country’s largest-ever arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;held talks&lt;/a&gt; with Bangladesh on the possible sale of JF-17s, as it widens its arms supply ambitions beyond South Asia and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965472/absolutely-we-are-ready-asif-says-pakistan-can-confront-aggression-on-eastern-western-borders-simultaneously&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geo News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is currently under a $7bn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1860850&quot;&gt;IMF programme&lt;/a&gt;, its 24th, which followed a short-term &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1762360&quot;&gt;$3bn deal &lt;/a&gt;that helped avert a sovereign default in 2023. It secured the Fund’s support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The mutual defence pact, signed in September, committed both sides to treat any aggression against either country as an attack on both, significantly deepening a decades-old security partnership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has long provided military support to the kingdom, including training and advisory deployments, while Saudi Arabia has repeatedly stepped in to support Pakistan financially during periods of economic stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Riyadh announced a $6bn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1440974&quot;&gt;support package&lt;/a&gt; for Pakistan, including a $3bn deposit at the central bank and $3bn worth of oil supplies on deferred payment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia has since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959240&quot;&gt;rolled over&lt;/a&gt; deposits multiple times, including a $1.2bn deferment last year, helping Islamabad stabilise its foreign exchange reserves amid chronic balance-of-payments pressures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#arms-sales-outreach&quot; id=&quot;arms-sales-outreach&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Arms sales outreach&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has in recent months stepped up defence outreach as it seeks to expand arms exports and monetise its domestic defence industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, Islamabad &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962754&quot;&gt;struck &lt;/a&gt;a weapons deal worth more than $4bn with Libya’s eastern-based Libyan National Army, officials said, one of the country’s largest-ever arms sales, which includes JF-17 fighter jets and training aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452&quot;&gt;held talks&lt;/a&gt; with Bangladesh on the possible sale of JF-17s, as it widens its arms supply ambitions beyond South Asia and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the defence minister said the success of its weapons industry could transform the country’s economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our aircraft have been tested, and we are receiving so many orders that Pakistan may not need the International Monetary Fund in six months,” Khawaja Asif &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965472/absolutely-we-are-ready-asif-says-pakistan-can-confront-aggression-on-eastern-western-borders-simultaneously&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;Geo News&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is currently under a $7bn &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1860850&quot;&gt;IMF programme&lt;/a&gt;, its 24th, which followed a short-term &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1762360&quot;&gt;$3bn deal &lt;/a&gt;that helped avert a sovereign default in 2023. It secured the Fund’s support after Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies provided financial and deposit rollovers.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Shikhar Dhawan condemned the brutal assault on a Hindu widow in Bangladesh, calling the violence unacceptable.

      <title>Bangladesh in talks with ICC over fate of T20 World Cup games</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965634/bangladesh-in-talks-with-icc-over-fate-of-t20-world-cup-games</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh cricket said on Wednesday it was in talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC) for a “practical” solution to its request to move its T20 World Cup matches out of India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872&quot;&gt;forced&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman to quit the Indian Premier League (IPL) on Saturday, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965259&quot;&gt;prompting anger&lt;/a&gt; in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With ties tense between the two countries, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;Bangladesh wants&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their World Cup games from India to co-hosts Sri Lanka, citing security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Cup begins on February 7 and Bangladesh are scheduled to play their four group matches in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Senior Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) official Nazmul Abedeen Fahim told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; today that talks were ongoing with the ICC “regarding security issues”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A BCB statement said it would “continue constructive engagement with the ICC and relevant event authorities”, seeking an “affable and practical solution that ensures the smooth and successful participation of the team”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB said it was “firmly committed to placing the highest priority on the safety, security and well-being” of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC has not commented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh police say ex-councillor was behind Hadi’s murder</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965562/bangladesh-police-say-ex-councillor-was-behind-hadis-murder</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Inqilab Moncho spokesperson Sharif Osman Hadi was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928&quot;&gt;killed&lt;/a&gt; on the instructions of Taijul Islam Chowdhury Bappi, a former councillor of Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) Ward-6, said Shafikul Islam, additional commissioner of the Detective Branch (DB) of Dhaka Metropolitan Police, on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bappi is also the organising secretary of the Dhaka City North unit of Jubo League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafikul disclosed the information at a press conference held at the DMP Media Centre this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said the DB has submitted a charge sheet against 17 people, including prime accused Faisal Karim Masud, in connection with Hadi’s murder. Of the accused, 12 have already been arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DB official said the investigation revealed that Faisal is a member of the banned Bangladesh Chhatra League and that Hadi was killed in an act of political vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to a question, Shafikul said Faisal and his associate Alamgir Sheikh carried out the killing on Bappi’s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi, an aspiring candidate for Dhaka-8 and a prominent youth leader during last year’s July uprising, was shot in the Paltan area on December 12. He died on December 18 while undergoing treatment in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On December 14, Inqilab Moncho Member Secretary Abdullah Al Jaber filed an attempted murder case with Paltan Model Police Station against Faisal and several unnamed individuals, which later turned into a murder case. The case was subsequently transferred to the DB.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman registers for PSL following IPL snub</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965471/bangladesh-pacer-mustafizur-rahman-registers-for-psl-following-ipl-snub</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman has registered for the Pakistan Super League (PSL) draft following his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964965&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; from the Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) squad for the Indian Premier League (IPL).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 30-year-old left-arm pacer, known for his variations and death-over bowling, was acquired by Kolkata for INR 9.20 crore in the IPL mini-auction held in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was the only Bangladesh player signed for the season. On Saturday, Kolkata announced his release after receiving instructions from the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCCI secretary Devajit Saikia cited “recent developments” as the reason, without providing further details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision comes amid strained relations between India and Bangladesh, linked to reports of attacks on minority communities in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Bangladesh has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965259&quot;&gt;banned IPL broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; in the country and the Bangladesh Cricket Board has requested the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965099&quot;&gt;ICC to shift&lt;/a&gt; its T20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has played in multiple IPL seasons since 2016 and taken over 60 wickets in the league, previously featured in the PSL for Lahore Qalandars. The PSL has confirmed his registration for the upcoming edition, with the draft expected soon.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
