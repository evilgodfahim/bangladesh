      <title>Pakistan orders screening of travellers in view of Nipah virus threat</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969545/pakistan-orders-screening-of-travellers-in-view-of-nipah-virus-threat</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Pakistan on Wednesday decided to enforce “strict and enhanced health surveillance” at all entry points in the country with immediate effect in order to prevent the cross-border transmission of Nipah virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nipah, carried by fruit bats and animals such as pigs, can trigger a deadly brain-swelling fever in humans and can also spread directly from person to person through close contact. Several vaccines are in development but remain in testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is classified as a priority pathogen by the World Health Organisation (WHO) because of its ability to spark fast‑moving outbreaks, its fatality rate of 40 per cent to 75pc, and the fact that there is no approved vaccine or cure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The measures taken by authorities in Pakistan coincide with those taken multiple other countries — Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand and Malaysia — after India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969509&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the detection of two cases in December last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this connection, the Border Health Services-Pakistan (BHS-P) — an ancillary department of the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination — issued an advisory which referred to a regional alert reported by international and regional public health surveillance mechanisms, including the WHO&lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789290222293&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; South East Asia Region Epidemiological Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing the alert, the advisory said in view of the “suspected cases of Nipah virus infection in West Bengal, India, and considering the high case fatality rate, zoonotic nature, and potential for human-to-human transmission, it has become imperative to further strengthen preventive and surveillance measures at Pakistan’s borders”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In order to prevent the cross-border transmission of Nipah virus in Pakistan and to ensure early detection and prompt response, the competent authority has decided to enforce strict and enhanced health surveillance at all points of entry with immediate effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These instructions shall be applicable to all points of entry, including international airports, seaports, and ground/ land border crossings, without any exception,” the advisory said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outlining the instructions, the advisory said all in-charges at entry points should ensure 100pc screening of all arriving passengers, transit passengers, crew members, drivers, helpers, and support staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No individual shall be allowed entry into Pakistan without health clearance by BHS-P,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the new measures, mandatory verification of the country of origin and complete travel and transit history for the preceding 21 days shall be carried out for each and every traveller, irrespective of their nationality or travel status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All in-charges at points of entry shall exercise special vigilance for travellers originating from, or transiting through, Nipah-affected or high-risk regions. Any false declaration, concealment, or misreporting of travel history shall be immediately documented and reported to the competent authorities for further necessary action,” the advisory stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, travellers are also required to undergo thermal screening and clinical assessment at entry points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Screening staff shall remain alert for early signs and symptoms of Nipah virus infection, including fever, headache, respiratory symptoms and neurological signs such as confusion, drowsiness or altered consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Any individual consistent with suspected Nipah virus case definition shall be immediately isolated at the point of entry, restricted from onward movement, and managed strictly in accordance with infection prevention and control (IPC) protocols,” it was instructed in the advisory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such suspected cases should be promptly referred to the designated isolation facility or a tertiary care hospital in coordination with provincial and district health authorities, the advisory said, adding that the “conveyance concerned (aircraft, vessel, vehicle) and surrounding area shall be immediately disinfected as per approved standard operating procedures”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In-charges at entry points have been further directed to ensure strict compliance with IPC measures, including the mandatory use of personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene, and environmental sanitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any lapse in surveillance or IPC practices should be treated as serious negligence, the advisory said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, “daily case/ nil reports from all points of entry shall be recorded in the BHS-P system already in vogue and shared with National Command and Operation Centre and the National International Health Regulation Focal Point”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any delay, weak surveillance, under-reporting, or non-compliance with these instructions should not be tolerated, the advisory stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“All in-charges at points of entry are directed to ensure strict compliance with the above instructions in letter and spirit. These measures shall remain in force until further orders are issued by the competent authority,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, the National Institute of Health (NIH) also issued an alert to health departments, healthcare providers, and BHS-P regarding the potential threat of Nipah virus spillover into Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alert said that while Pakistan had not yet reported a human case, a significant situation was emerging in South Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As of January 2026, an outbreak has been confirmed in West Bengal, India. […] Due to its high case fatality rate ranging from 40pc to 75pc and the potential for human-to-human transmission, health authorities are placing the region on high alert,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the advisory, there was currently no specific anti-viral treatment or licensed vaccine available for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Management remains primarily supportive and focuses on symptomatic treatment, including management of fever, respiratory distress, and neurological complications,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Severely ill patients often require hospitalisation and may need intensive care support, including mechanical ventilation. The clinical effectiveness of ribavirin (broad-spectrum antiviral medication) remains inconclusive and it is not routinely recommended,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It urged travellers to avoid contact with symptomatic individuals or contaminated materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Travellers returning from affected areas within 21 days who develop symptoms should self-isolate, seek medical attention, and inform the provider of their travel history and exposure,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further directed the provincial health department to designate at least one tertiary-care hospital or infectious disease unit for the isolation and clinical management of cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also urged provincial public laboratories to review and strengthen their capability for safe sample handling and transportation. Further, it directed that rapid response teams be placed on standby for case investigation, contact tracing, and coordinated field response for any cluster of acute encephalitis (brain inflammation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It further said that provinces with international airports or land border points needed to main realtime communication with BHS-P for any alerts or travellers requiring follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#risk-in-pakistan-minimal&quot; id=&quot;risk-in-pakistan-minimal&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Risk in Pakistan minimal’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talking to &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, Microbiologist Prof Dr Javaid Usman said that the virus was named after a place in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The virus is spread through the droppings of fruit bats and pigs,” he said. He further said that if cases were reported in Pakistan, it would be through carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Currently, a few cases have been reported in the Indian state of Bengal due to which neighbouring countries have announced to screen their masses,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Replying to a question, he said that the major symptoms of the virus included fever and neurological disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People can have fits. The virus can spread through respiratory droplets, saliva and the blood of a patient who has tested positive. So positive samples are kept in isolation,” Dr Usman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief of the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Dr Mumtaz Ali Khan, told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that this was the 51st outbreak since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although we have issued advisories to alert airport authorities, there are very few chances of identifying patients as the incubation period of the virus is 9 to 14 days,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infectious disease expert Dr Rana Safdar told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that Nipah virus was listed by the WHO as a priority pathogen due to a high fatality rate (up to 80pc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Its progression is therefore being closely monitored. While efforts are underway, to date no effective vaccine or treatment is available so the management of infected cases is largely supportive,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Safdar said, since its identification in 1998, the outbreaks of Nipah virus had been sporadically occurring in South and Southeast Asia, largely in rural settings. Countries which have previously reported outbreaks include Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Bangladesh and India, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the principle ‘infectious diseases respect no boundaries’, holds, due to the peculiar transmission dynamics, the risk of spread to surrounding countries thus far remains moderate to low. Given the current outbreak in India’s West Bengal and the associated media hype, there is no reason to panic as the risk of the virus in Pakistan stays minimal,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While executing preventive measures, it’s important to consider that the usually deployed passenger screening at airports does not help much in preventing virus importation. We otherwise need to remain prepared, anticipating and mapping risk and enhancing vigilance in identified vulnerable zones,” Dr Safdar said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All you need to know about Nipah virus</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969548/all-you-need-to-know-about-nipah-virus</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Two cases of the deadly Nipah virus in India have prompted countries in Asia to step up airport screening to prevent the spread of the infection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what is Nipah virus, and how worried should people be?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#what-is-nipah-virus&quot; id=&quot;what-is-nipah-virus&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What is Nipah virus?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nipah is a rare viral infection that spreads largely from infected animals, mainly fruit bats, to humans. It can be asymptomatic, but it is often very dangerous, with a case fatality rate of 40 to 75 per cent, depending on the local healthcare system’s capacity for detection and management, the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/nipah-virus&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Health Organisation&lt;/a&gt; (WHO) says.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;An undated image of fruit bats in Kerala, India. &amp;mdash; Reuters/File&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/28212852caac030.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;An undated image of fruit bats in Kerala, India. — Reuters/File&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while it can also spread from person to person, it does not do this easily, and outbreaks are usually small and fairly contained, according to experts and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Candidate vaccines are under development, although none have been approved yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#how-common-is-it&quot; id=&quot;how-common-is-it&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How common is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nipah was first identified in Malaysia in 1999. Since then, there have been small outbreaks almost every year, mostly in Bangladesh. India also sees sporadic outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://cepi.net/nipah&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations&lt;/a&gt; (CEPI), a group that tracks emerging disease threats and funds the development of medical tools to protect against them, as of December, 750 cases had been recorded in all, and 415 of the patients died. &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; traced the spread of Nipah in a 2023 series, Bat Lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#how-does-it-spread&quot; id=&quot;how-does-it-spread&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How does it spread?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When first identified in Malaysia, Nipah spread largely through direct contact with sick pigs or contaminated tissues. Since then, it more commonly spreads from contact with what scientists say is its natural host: fruit bats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the consumption of fruit or fruit products — like raw date palm juice — containing urine or saliva from infected fruit bats has been the most likely source of infection, the WHO says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human-to-human spread has been found, mainly after close contact between a sick patient and their family or caregivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#what-are-the-symptoms&quot; id=&quot;what-are-the-symptoms&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What are the symptoms?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial symptoms of Nipah, such as fever, headaches and muscle pain, are not specific and can be confused with other diseases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These can then be followed by neurological signs indicating acute encephalitis, or inflammation of the brain, and some people experience severe respiratory problems.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;

        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;In this file photo, an airport official checks the temperature of a passenger upon her arrival at the Bacha Khan International Airport in Peshawar. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to a coma in days. Most people who get better make a full recovery, but some experience long-term neurological problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#how-worried-should-we-be&quot; id=&quot;how-worried-should-we-be&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;How worried should we be?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Nipah is a dangerous disease with a high fatality rate, it has not yet shown signs of becoming more transmissible among humans or spreading easily worldwide, scientists say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, it remains a significant public health concern, according to the WHO, particularly in countries where outbreaks are more common. It can also lead to the mass culling of farm animals such as pigs that are susceptible to the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists say, however, that it is unlikely to spread globally and also point out that airport screening may be ineffective as the virus has a long incubation period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#what-vaccines-or-treatments-are-available&quot; id=&quot;what-vaccines-or-treatments-are-available&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What vaccines or treatments are available?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for Nipah, although several candidates are undergoing testing, including one developed by the Oxford University scientists involved in developing one of the Covid-19 vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The last year was supposed to be the one in which Pakistan were supposed to redefine their approach towards Twenty20 cricket. It didn’t come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the promises of more aggression with the bat and the subsequent change in personnel, the team scored at just 127.47 – more than a run (1.37 to be precise) slower than the year before. There was a record for the most wins in a calendar year — 21 — but 18 of those had come against lower-ranked or weaker sides in Bangladesh, West Indies, Afghanistan, Oman, UAE, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attempted reinvention — that brought in new captain and head coach — focused towards ensuring Pakistan’s T20 World Cup campaign this year does not look similar to 2024, when they were knocked out in just the group stage following embarrassing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1839304&quot;&gt;defeats&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1838302&quot;&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1838912/pakistan-squander-solid-start-as-india-claim-t20-thriller&quot;&gt;India.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some positives though. Pakistan look more settled as a team with the roles for each player well defined as the selectors and team management have persisted with the same core for the last 10 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was not the case in last year’s Champions Trophy when Pakistan, due to an injury to one player, rejigged their entire batting order, and before the 2024 edition of the T20 World Cup when two cricketers came out of retirement only to play that tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, who are accustomed to chaos, this is a good start. But, they face their sternest challenge when they come up against Australia — albeit in the familiar surroundings of Lahore — from Thursday in three T20Is. A series against a tough and ruthless opposition like Australia is not a bad way to get ready for a world event and it will help Salman Ali Agha in shaping his playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These games are very important because they will determine what will be our XI for the World Cup,” the Pakistan T20I captain told a press conference before his team’s final practice session ahead of the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are pretty much on track in regards to the direction we ventured upon a year ago. We have not had the conditions [in most series] to score 200 runs, but we scored 200 whenever we got them. We did so over here [at Gaddafi Stadium] against Bangladesh in almost every game. The team’s progress has been good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, there remain areas that need to be fine-tuned before Pakistan departs for Colombo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since their T20I tri-series &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958160&quot;&gt;victory&lt;/a&gt; in November 2025, Pakistan have played only two matches in Sri Lanka and the last of them had to be curtailed because of the rain. Most of the Pakistan players had been playing in leagues around the world and the performances of the batters have not been satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub, Pakistan’s two openers, are coming off an underwhelming BPL and Fakhar Zaman failed to fire in the ILT20. Babar Azam had a torrid BBL in which he failed to put any score of note and his scoring rate remained under scanner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaheen Afridi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964122&quot;&gt;returns&lt;/a&gt; to competitive cricket after a knee injury curtailed his BBL stint with Brisbane Heat. Being the most senior pacer in the side, Shaheen will carry the weight of Pakistan’s four-man fast bowling contingent and his workload will be stretched in the absence of Haris Rauf as Pakistan will often return to him in the latter half of the opposition’s innings to stop the flow of runs in the death overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s recent successes have been engineered by their spin attack and the selectors had no qualms in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969045&quot;&gt;naming&lt;/a&gt; a spin-heavy contingent for the T20 World Cup, which they will play in spin-friendly conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the ongoing T20 World Cup cycle (since the final of the 2024 T20 World Cup final), Pakistan spinners have taken 140 wickets in 44 matches at an average of 18.477 and have bowled at an economy rate of 6.94. Among the full-member teams, only India have taken more wickets (161) than them at an average of 15.68. But, India’s economy rate of 7.18 falls behind Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, the stiff challenge that this Australian side poses will test each aspect of Pakistan’s game, which is the best possible preparation that a team can ask for before a world event. Pakistan have lost all their completed last seven T20Is against Australia, including the solitary game between these two sides on Pakistan soil (also at Gaddafi Stadium). They last&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1441544&quot;&gt; won&lt;/a&gt; a T20I against Australia back in October 2018 when Sarfaraz Ahmed was the captain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia play the series without their frontline pace attack due to the injury-related&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967882&quot;&gt; absences&lt;/a&gt; of Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Middle-order hard-hitter Tim David will also not play in this series because of hamstring woes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three will join the team in Sri Lanka ahead of their warm-up in Colombo. But, the squad that in land in Lahore in two batches – first in early afternoon and the second in late evening – contains most of those in Travis Head, captain Mitch Marsh, Cameron Green, Marcus Stoinis, and Adam Zampa, who have turned this side into a formidable unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Australia decided against holding practice before the first T20I as most of their players have had a camp in the UAE over the last four days and the others arrived straight from Australia after having played in the BBL finals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marsh, who had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969530/australian-squad-arrives-in-lahore-for-t20i-series-ahead-of-icc-world-cup&quot;&gt;landed&lt;/a&gt; in Lahore just a few hours before the press conference, revealed that the final call on the team composition will be made when the squad sits together as a group later in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Thank you for having us,” Marsh said. “We’re very excited to be here. It’s a really important time in both teams’ preparation for the [T20] World Cup. Most of the squad has been in Dubai for the last four days training and getting together. Some of us have flown in a little bit later due to Big Bash commitments. But we’re ready to go and looking forward to a great series.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But would there be any acclimatisation issues with such a quick turnaround?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I didn’t pack too many jumpers,” Marsh said, “[I] wasn’t aware Pakistan got this cold.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Political movements do not become dangerous when they speak the language of faith; they become dangerous when they claim a monopoly over virtue. This observation, adapted from British philosopher Isaiah Berlin, has rarely been more relevant than in today’s Bangladesh. Following the 2024 collapse of the authoritarian regime of Sheikh Hasina, the nation stands at [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Scotland name squad for T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969419/scotland-name-squad-for-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;EDINBURGH: With new head coach Owen Dawkins at the helm, and under the captaincy of Richie Berrington, Scotland have named their squad for their seventh appearance at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scotland have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh at the global showpiece being staged jointly by India and Sri Lanka from Feb 7 to March 8. Bangladesh refused to play their World Cup matches in India due to security concerns amid political tensions between New Delhi and Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European side had also participated in the inaugural edition of the tournament staged in 2007 in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zainullah Ihsan is a first-time call-up, with the Afghan-born fast bowler having recently qualified to play for Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;

      <title>Pakistan to host South Asian Games in March next year</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969422/pakistan-to-host-south-asian-games-in-march-next-year</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: The 14th edition of the South Asian Games will be held in Pakistan from March 23 to 31 next year, it was decided at a meeting of the South Asian Federations held in Tashkent the other day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Following detailed deliberations, the meeting unanimously decided that the South Asian Games shall be scheduled from March 23 to 31, 2027. The meeting further authorised the Pakistan Olympic Association / NOC Pakistan to make adjustments to the schedule within the same time window, with a flexibility of up to one week, as may be required for operational or logistical reasons,” read a press release issued by the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The meeting in Uzbekistan capital was held on the sidelines of the 46th General Assembly of the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“At the outset of the meeting, the South Asian Olympic family extended its warm congratulations to Sheikh Joaan bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani on his successful and unanimous election as President of the OCA,” added the press release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The meeting was chaired by HRH Prince Jigyel Ugyen Wangchuck, OCA Vice-President for South Asia, and was attended by the Presidents and/or Secretaries General of the National Olympic Committees of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India’s participation in the South Asian Games will depend on the stance of its government, which has avoided sending sporting teams to Pakistan over the past several years due to political tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Arif Saeed, President of the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) and the South Asia Olympic Council (SAOC), participated in the meeting along with Mohyuddin Ahmad Wani, Federal Secretary, Ministry of Sports, Government of Pakistan,” the press release further stated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also agreed by all countries that the disciplines and events will remain the same as had already been finalised at the SAOC Executive Committee Meeting held in February last year in Lahore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the South Asian countries agreed to initiate further deliberations on developing a more sustainable and future-oriented model for sports in South Asia, with a focus on long-term regional cooperation and efficient delivery of multi-sport events.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“During the meeting, Mohyuddin, extended an invitation to the South Asian countries to visit Pakistan in May 2026, with a view to continuing consultations, reviewing and monitoring the progress of preparations for the [2027] South Asian Games, and strengthening regional collaboration in sport,” the POA news release concluded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh: BNP supremo sounds alarm over vote rigging; chaos ahead of February 12 polls</title>

      <description>Bangladesh polls: There are apprehensions that radicals will try to disrupt elections and deny the majority to BNP, pushing for a coalition government comprising Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI). The JeI has been emboldened following the outreach by the US and the UK. The US has allegedly tried to guide JeI to navigate the complicated politics of Bangladesh to consolidate its position.</description>

      <title>Myanmar ‘election’ shows the military regime is here to stay. How should the world respond?</title>

      <description>&lt;span&gt;Myanmar ‘election’ shows the military regime is here to stay. How should the world respond?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;Expert comment&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;LToremark&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;time datetime=&quot;2026-01-27T16:54:00+00:00&quot; title=&quot;Tuesday, 27 January, 2026&quot;&gt;27 January 2026&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Amid calls for the international community to ‘unequivocally reject’ the election results, only two real options remain: accept the status quo or engage with the military.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class=&quot;media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;img alt=&quot;A ballot paper is read out by a member of Myanmar&apos;s Union Election Commission at a polling station in downtown Yangon.&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; src=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2026-01/2026-01-27-myanmar-election-2253781614.jpg?itok=UHH76Bfs&quot; width=&quot;1200&quot; /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Five years after its military coup, Myanmar has a nominally civilian government. But the outcome of the general elections held on 25 January was never in doubt. Opposition parties were banned, voting did not take place in areas of the country affected by the ongoing civil war and there were widespread reports of coerced voting. As a result, we can be sure the military’s chosen front organization, the Union Solidarity and Development Party, won a landslide victory.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN Special Rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar, Tom Andrews, has called on the international community to ’&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2026/01/illegitimate-elections-yield-illegitimate-results-un-expert-urges-rejection&quot;&gt;unequivocally reject&lt;/a&gt;’ the outcome. But is that the best way forward? Or is now the time to reassess relations with the military (‘Tatmadaw’ in Burmese)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;align-right embedded-entity embed&quot;&gt;&lt;figure class=&quot;media media-embed media-quote&quot;&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class=&quot;media__wrapper&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;media__content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;svg class=&quot;icon icon--open-quote&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot;&gt;
          &lt;use xlink:href=&quot;#icon-open-quote&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Virtue signalling displeasure is easy – but it is not going to improve lives.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation in Myanmar is dire. The civil war that erupted after the February 2021 military coup is in a stalemate. Ethnic armed organizations and anti-regime militias control around &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bnionline.net/en/news/mass-killings-rise-across-myanmar-2025&quot;&gt;38 per cent&lt;/a&gt; of the country but are unable to capture the lowlands, the heartland of the military. The Tatmadaw, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gnlm.com.mm/3rd-myanmar-russia-joint-anti-terrorism-committee-meeting-held-in-nay-pyi-taw/&quot;&gt;backed by Russian advisers&lt;/a&gt;, continues to launch deadly strikes into areas it does not control. Evidence indicates that the anti-regime forces are in retreat. In 2025, the Tatmadaw &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bnionline.net/en/news/mass-killings-rise-across-myanmar-2025&quot;&gt;retook 26 of the bases and camps&lt;/a&gt; it had previously lost to the rebels and the number of armed clashes has fallen since its mid-2023 peak.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of the conflict, Myanmar’s economy has collapsed, state control is disintegrating, and organized crime groups are exploiting the chaos. But despite the situation on the ground, there is little to no external pressure to end the conflict. None of Myanmar’s neighbours – &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/asia-pacific/china&quot; title=&quot;China&quot;&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, India, Bangladesh, Laos or Thailand – want to see the military overthrown. All seem sanguine about the dangers emanating from the conflict, including irregular migration, illegal drug production, border insecurity and economic stagnation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2023, China supported a temporary alliance of ethnic organizations to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thinkchina.sg/society/chinas-all-out-effort-wipe-out-scam-syndicate-families-northern-myanmar&quot;&gt;destroy some Myanmar-based scam centres&lt;/a&gt; that had defrauded huge numbers of Chinese citizens. Once the operation was complete, however, it returned to favouring the status quo. And while the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed a ‘&lt;a href=&quot;https://asean.org/wp-content/uploads/Chairmans-Statement-on-ALM-Five-Point-Consensus-24-April-2021-FINAL-a-1.pdf&quot;&gt;five-point consensus&lt;/a&gt;’ on the crisis in 2021, this has not prevented some of its 11 member states from operating rival policies towards Myanmar.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although many countries outside the region have condemned the coup, the Tatmadaw’s violence and the fraudulent elections, there is no sign of any of them taking serious action to improve the situation. The immediate question facing the wider world is how to respond to the results of an election that was clearly neither free nor fair. Virtue signalling displeasure is easy – but it is not going to improve lives. Given that the Tatmadaw-backed government enjoys the tacit support of its neighbours and continues to receive military backing from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.chathamhouse.org/regions/russia-and-eurasia/russia&quot; title=&quot;Russia: Current affairs and analysis&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, we can be reasonably confident that it is not about to collapse. The question is whether or not to engage it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have been here before. This moment in Myanmar has parallels with the situation in 2008. The military leadership is seeking a fresh start and looking for international acceptance. Back then, the Tatmadaw introduced a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Myanmar_2008&quot;&gt;new constitution&lt;/a&gt;, a major step in the process of undoing the previous military coup, in 1962. This constitution remains in force but is deeply flawed: it reserves a quarter of the seats in parliament for the military, for example. However, it does offer a roadmap towards peace, stability and even something approaching democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2026, outside powers have three options. One: they can tolerate the status quo with all its spiralling problems. Two: they can intervene to try to overthrow the military regime. Three: they can deal with the military regime in the hope of improving the situation for the people of Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little likelihood of regional support for option two, which leaves a choice between tolerating the status quo and engagement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;align-left embedded-entity embed&quot;&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
        
        
      &lt;/header&gt;

                    
      
              
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/article&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The worst outcome would be a form of engagement that delivered international acceptance of continuing violence. Engagement must come with principles. Here, the ASEAN five-point consensus could be an important lever. It calls for an immediate cessation of violence; constructive dialogue among all parties concerned; an ASEAN special envoy to facilitate mediation of the dialogue; humanitarian assistance; and for the special envoy to visit Myanmar to meet all parties concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is hard to exaggerate the nationalist mindset of the Tatmadaw, characterized by paranoid fear of outside powers and ethnic separatism. The military would most probably use any ceasefire period to rebuild its forces with the ambition of eventually capturing areas currently controlled by ethnic armed groups and rebel militias. How can such an agenda be constrained?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The military wrote its long-term objectives into &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myanmar-law-library.org/law-library/laws-and-regulations/constitutions/2008-constitution.html&quot;&gt;Article 6 of the 2008 constitution&lt;/a&gt;. They include ‘non-disintegration of the union’ – a nationalist demand to preserve the borders of the country – but also the ‘flourishing of a genuine, disciplined multi-party democratic system’ and ‘enhancing the eternal principles of justice, liberty and equality in the union’.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nipah Virus Could Spread Further Due to Bat Reservoir, WHO Says</title>
      <link>https://english.pravda.ru/news/society/165598-nipah-virus-risk-south-asia-who-warning/</link>
      <description>Further spread of the Nipah virus remains possible due to insufficient understanding of the pathogen and the presence of a natural reservoir in South Asia, according to the World Health Organization.
WHO official representative in Geneva Tarik Jasarevic told RIA Novosti that the virus continues to pose a risk because it circulates among bat populations in certain regions of India and Bangladesh.
&quot;Further Nipah virus infections are possible, given the known Nipah virus reservoir in bat populations in parts of India and Bangladesh, including West Bengal,”</description>

&lt;p&gt;On January 13, 2026, a large Turkish delegation, including officials from Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI), arrived in Dhaka to hold consultations with Bangladesh Air Force officials. Afterward, Bangladeshi officials reportedly confirmed the acquisition of six Turkish-manufactured T129 ATAK attack helicopters, as well as Hisar-O+ medium-range surface-to-air missile (SAM) systems, under a US$600 million deal.

      <title>Bangladesh Drifting Into A Nexus Of Military Dependency And Proxy Competition? Ominous Consequences For India, South Asia</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/bangladesh-drifting-nexus-military-dependency-and-proxy-competition-ominous-consequences</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these developments should ring alarm bells. The convergence of foreign military-industrial interests, Islamist political forces, and great-power rivalry risks turning Bangladesh into an epicenter of proxy competition and ideological confrontation. For a nation that has paid dearly for its independence and pluralistic identity, the cost of such entanglements may prove far higher than the short-term gains promised by arms deals and infrastructure projects.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

                                        &lt;p&gt;For average wage earners in Russia, it’s a big payday. For criminals seeking to escape the harsh conditions and abuse in prison, it’s a chance at freedom. &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/russia-immigrants-crackdown-xenophobia-central-asia-3fb300676f1855bc13e20bd7780534ea&quot;&gt;For immigrants hoping for a better life,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; it’s a simplified path to citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All they have to do is sign a contract to fight in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Russia seeks to replenish its forces in &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine&quot;&gt;nearly four years of war&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; — and avoid an unpopular nationwide mobilization — it’s pulling out all the stops to find new troops to send into the battlefield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some come from abroad to fight in what has become a bloody war of attrition. After signing a mutual defense treaty with Moscow in 2024, North Korea sent thousands of soldiers to help Russia &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/north-korea-ukraine-casualties-kursk-russia-a1207ba61ded5061f721ffa0f0650851&quot;&gt;defend its Kursk region&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; from a Ukrainian incursion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Men from South Asian countries, including India, Nepal and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-bangladesh-migrant-workers-d7df6a8b2ff60b46ce8e3fa3aafaf60e&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, complain of being duped into signing up to fight by recruiters promising jobs. Officials in Kenya, South Africa and Iraq say the same has happened to citizens from their countries.&lt;/p&gt;


    
        




    


&lt;h2&gt;Russian numbers in Ukraine&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Vladimir Putin &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/russia-putin-press-conference-ukraine-39fd3f2670227545a6f9e684038ed59d&quot;&gt;told his annual news conference&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure – 617,000 – in December 2023. It’s unclear if those numbers are accurate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still hidden are the numbers of military casualties, with Moscow having released limited official figures. The British Defense Ministry said last summer that more than 1 million Russian troops may have been killed or wounded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Independent Russian news site Mediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, scoured news reports, social media and government websites and collected the names of over 160,000 troops killed. More than 550 of those were foreigners from over two dozen countries.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;How Russia gets new soldiers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Ukraine, where martial law and nationwide mobilization has been in place since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022, Putin has resisted ordering a broad call-up. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a limited mobilization of 300,000 men was tried later that year, tens of thousands of people fled abroad. The effort stopped after a few weeks when the target was met, but a Putin decree left the door open for another call-up. It also made all military contracts effectively open-ended and barred soldiers from quitting service or being discharged, unless they reached certain age limits or were incapacitated by injuries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, Moscow has largely relied on what it describes as voluntary enlistment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flow of voluntary enlistees signing military contracts has remained strong, topping 400,000 last year, Putin said in December. It was not possible to independently verify the claim. Similar numbers were announced in 2024 and 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Activists say these contracts often stipulate a fixed term of service, such as one year, leading some potential enlistees to believe the commitment is temporary. But contracts are automatically extended indefinitely, they say. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;The incentives&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government offers high pay and extensive benefits to enlistees. Regional authorities offer various enlistment bonuses, sometimes amounting to tens of thousands of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Khanty-Mansi region of central Russia, for example, an enlistee would get about $50,000 in various bonuses, according to the local government. That’s more than twice the average annual income in the region, where monthly salaries in the first 10 months of 2025 were reported to be just over $1,600.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There also are tax breaks, debt relief and other perks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Kremlin claims of relying on voluntary enlistment, media reports and rights groups say conscripts — men aged 18-30 performing fixed-term mandatory military service and exempted from being sent to Ukraine — are often coerced by superiors into signing contracts that send them into battle. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recruitment also extends to prisoners and those in pretrial detention centers, a practice led early in the war by the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-convict-wagner-crime-108e410835e4bf27ac3192cd7f945b39&quot;&gt;late mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and adopted by the Defense Ministry. Laws now allow recruitment of both convicts and suspects in criminal cases.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;Targeting foreigners&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreigners also are recruiting targets, both inside Russia and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laws were adopted offering accelerated Russian citizenship for enlistees. Russian media and activists also report that raids in areas where migrants typically live or work lead to them being pressuring into military service, with new citizens sent to enlistment offices to determine if they’re eligible for mandatory service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, Putin decreed that military service was mandatory for certain foreigners seeking permanent residency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some reportedly are lured to Russia by trafficking rings promising jobs, then duping them into signing military contracts. Cuban authorities in 2023 identified and sought to dismantle one such ring operating from Russia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nepal’s Foreign Minister Narayan Prakash Saud told The Associated Press in 2024 that his country asked Russia to return &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/nepal-fighters-russia-ukraine-war-e57a45645666d02651f6efed4e3f21ae&quot;&gt;hundreds of Nepali nationals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; who were recruited to fight in Ukraine, as well as to repatriate the remains of those killed in the war. Nepal has since barred citizens from traveling to Russia or Ukraine for work, citing recruitment efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;Also in 2024, India’s federal investigation agency said it broke up a network that lured at least 35 of its citizens to Russia under the pretext of employment. The men were trained for combat and deployed to Ukraine against their will, with some “grievously injured,” the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Putin hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for talks in 2024, New Delhi said its nationals who were “misled” into joining the Russian army would be discharged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iraqi officials say about 5,000 of its citizens have joined the Russian military along with an unspecified number who are fighting alongside Ukrainian forces. Officials in Baghdad cracked down on such recruiting networks, with one man convicted last year of human trafficking and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An unknown number of Iraqis have been killed or gone missing while fighting in Ukraine. Some families have reported that relatives were lured to Russia under false pretenses and forced to enlist; in other cases, Iraqis have joined voluntarily for the salary and Russian citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreigners duped into fighting are especially vulnerable because they don’t speak Russian, have no military experience and are deemed “dispensable, to put it bluntly,” by military commanders, said Anton Gorbatsevich of the activist group Idite Lesom, or “Get Lost,” which helps men desert from the army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A drain on a slowing economy&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, a Ukrainian agency for the treatment of prisoners of war said over 18,000 foreign nationals had fought or are fighting on the Russian side. Almost 3,400 have been killed, and hundreds of citizens of 40 countries are held in Ukraine as POWs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If true, that represents a fraction of the 700,000 troops that Putin said are fighting for Russia in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using foreigners is only one way to meet the constant demand, said Artyom Klyga, head of the legal department at the Movement of Conscientious Objectors, noting Russian recruitment efforts appear to be stable. Most of those seeking help from the group, which assists men in avoiding military service, are Russian citizens, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kateryna Stepanenko, a Russia researcher at the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War, said the Kremlin has gotten more “creative” in the last two years with attracting enlistees, including foreigners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recruitment efforts are becoming “extremely expensive” for Russia, which faces a slowing economy, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;— &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associated Press writers Gerald Imray in Cape Town, South Africa, and Qassim Abdul-Zahra in Baghdad contributed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Rashid Latif on T20 World Cup squad: Too many spin-bowling all-rounders, wicket-keepers disrupt team balance</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969340/rashid-latif-on-t20-world-cup-squad-too-many-spin-bowling-all-rounders-wicket-keepers-disrupt-team-balance</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The long-awaited &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968995&quot;&gt;announcement&lt;/a&gt; of Pakistan’s 15-member squad for the Twenty20 World Cup finally came on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among many talking points, the biggest was the exclusion of speedster Haris Rauf; despite his good showing at the Big Bash Down Under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps he’d lost the trust of chief selector Aaqib Javed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pace spearhead Shaheen Shah Afridi &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964162&quot;&gt;suffered an injury&lt;/a&gt; during the Big Bash League, having missed the previous tri-series against Sri Lanka due to fitness issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With Haris absent, Shaheen will have to bear greater responsibility; needing to take wickets in the early overs, and the death overs — which will be particularly challenging for him as his performance in that phase has not been great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman Mirza has emerged as a good pacer, performing well with both the new and old ball, while Naseem Shah’s fitness and performance were satisfactory, leading to his selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many others were overlooked. The selectors did not choose Abbas Afridi, Mohammad Wasim Jr., or Ahmed Daniyal, opting instead for fast-bowling all-rounder Faheem Ashraf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mohammad Nawaz, Shadab Khan, Saim Ayub, and skipper Salman Ali Agha are the spin-bowling all-rounders in the team, but their increased number, as well as the presence of multiple wicket-keepers seems to disrupt the team balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The squad includes three wicket-keepers, none of whom were the first choice for their Pakistan Super League franchises. Khawaja Nafay is with Quetta Gladiators, but the keeping is handled by Sri Lankans Kusal Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usman Khan played as a batsman for Multan Sultans and occasionally kept wickets, but Mohammad Rizwan was the number one choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sahibzada Farhan kept wickets in just one match for Islamabad United, as Andries Gous and Azam Khan were the main wicket-keepers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, the cricketing world has wicket-keepers who are match-winners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s philosophy is different. Instead of a specialist, any batter who can keep wickets is given a chance without considering how costly it could prove for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#babar-conundrum&quot; id=&quot;babar-conundrum&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Babar conundrum&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further beyond, there are questions regarding former skipper Babar Azam’s selection, as his performance in the shortest format of the game hasn’t been very impressive of late; the batter coming off a below-par in Big Bash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a striking likeness between Babar and captain Salman Ali Agha. They are similar batters, occupying number three and four spots in the line-up. They may perform well in low-scoring matches, but could face difficulties in high-scoring games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The batting lineup has five openers who are capable of batting at different numbers, including Saim, Sahibzada, Babar, Fakhar Zaman and Nafay, who have all been seen playing in the top order for their franchises. However, when it comes to the middle-order, batters like Irfan Khan Niazi and Abdul Samad have not been given opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spotlight has been on the performance of Pakistan players in the Big Bash, while overlooking their performance in the Bangladesh Premier League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opener Sahibzada scored 185 runs in nine innings with a strike rate of 118.58, which is not particularly commendable. Similarly, Saim Ayub scored 68 runs in four innings with a strike rate of only 117.24.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fakhar Zaman, who went to play in the International League T20, performed below his standards, scoring 260 runs in 12 innings with an average of 21.66 and a strike rate of 124.40.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babar, meanwhile, played seven innings in the Big Bash, scoring 131 runs at a strike rate of 99.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#spin-strength&quot; id=&quot;spin-strength&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Spin strength&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, Pakistan’s spin department looks the strongest with two specialist spinners in Abrar Ahmed and Usman Tariq, who are world-class. However, it might be difficult to see both play together since Nawaz, Shadab and Saim are the three spin-bowling all-rounders available. With their presence, it is likely that only one of Usman or Abrar is able to secure a spot in the playing eleven.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan could benefit from the conditions in Sri Lanka, with the team playing all their matches in Colombo. Their biggest test will come against holders India, with the United States, Namibia and the Netherlands the other teams in the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On paper, Pakistan should advance from the group stage. Further ahead, it remains to be seen whether they can forge a combination that can help them go all the way.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Putting money first, cricket last</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969297/putting-money-first-cricket-last</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; The question is: if India is allowed to pick and choose, why should Bangladesh not be allowed to do the same?&amp;mdash;AFP/file &quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/6977f8d3092b0.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;The question is: if India is allowed to pick and choose, why should Bangladesh not be allowed to do the same?—AFP/file&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BANGLADESH’S&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt; removal&lt;/a&gt; from the ICC World T20 in India is the crisis that nobody wants to talk about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, you might find endless analysis on South Asian talk shows, but look internationally and it is a governance disaster that shall not be mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question why the international media will not discuss this issue, and the question of why Bangladesh is out of the tournament, both have the same answer: India’s absolute power over world cricket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) is meant to govern in the best interests of the global game. However, what was clear over two decades has crystallised over the last two years: the purpose of the ICC is exactly what critics claim — to borrow from Donald Trump’s vocabulary — to put India first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan should participate in the World T20; but it should also support Bangladesh‘s cause, and continue to point out the hypocrisy in the treatment that it receives, versus what India gets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is perfectly evident that there is one rule for India, and another for its opponents. This reality is enabled by the spineless apathy of the other so-called cricketing powers. The evidence is unquestionable and is unquestioningly ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has taken a political decision not to play bilateral tournaments against Pakistan. It has taken a political decision not to step foot on Pakistani soil. Cricketers from Pakistan and of Pakistani heritage face ridiculous processes to be allowed to participate in events in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is allowed to do this for purely political reasons, and the ICC says nothing. But, when another nation, Bangladesh in this instance, takes a similar position towards playing in India it is dropped from the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The merits of Bangladesh’s argument are not even worth debating. Why do I say this? I say this because the merits of India’s arguments against Pakistan aren’t worth debating. They are purely political.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If India is allowed to pick and choose, why should Bangladesh not be allowed to do the same?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all know the answer to this: Bangladesh is not responsible for the financial gravy train of international cricket, and it does not hold numerical sway at the ICC board. India first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second troubling aspect of this decision is the complete dismissal of the safety concerns of the Bangladesh team. The root of this row is the removal of Mustafizur Rahman from the IPL because of threats received promising disruption to matches that he would be involved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if those safety concerns are credible enough to warrant his exit from an Indian tournament, then it doesn’t seem too unreasonable of Bangladesh to have concerns about playing matches in India. Yet the ICC says that there are no valid safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, nothing that the ICC says can be taken seriously given the absolute control that India holds over the ICC’s operations. India would not wish for any team to refuse to play in India for security reasons — while India can withdraw or refuse to play in a country whenever it wishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this hypocrisy is evident in international cricket for a number of years. Even during the years of Pakistan’s exile from international cricket, security threats in other countries, including India, didn’t matter to cricket’s governing body. One rule for India and one rule for everybody else. India first.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question that then remains is one of Pakistan’s participation in the tournament. The answer I believe is a simple one. Pakistan should participate in the World T20 because it has already agreed to the terms of its participation — namely that it will play its matches in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Pakistan should continue to support Bangladesh‘s cause within the ICC. Pakistan should continue to point out the hypocrisy in the treatment that it receives versus the treatment that India receives on the international stage. Pakistan should explain how the Bangladesh situation is another example of India first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shame here is that given the tumultuous decision that was taken, and given the significance of the governance crisis in the game, it is a matter that the world’s cricket nations seem eager to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where are the game’s leading commentators? Where are the game’s great cricketers? Where are the people who believe in the spirit of cricket? Where are guardians of cricket’s moral galaxy when their voice is most needed? The answer is nowhere. Money talks. India first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the tournament does go ahead with Pakistan in it, we will inevitably see the ritual India Pakistan group contest. The fact that we cannot hold a world tournament without India and Pakistan playing a group match confirms the game’s abdication to the business suits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to money spinning international tournaments, politics and principles are quickly put to one side. What really matters is open for the world to see. What really matters is the revenue that the ICC and the Indian cricket board can make from a match against Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, the governance of international cricket is in the gutter. The game is being destroyed by greed and political motivations. But who has the guts to stand up to this? More importantly, who can put a stop to it? The answer is nobody. The strategy is always India first because by putting India first the other nations also put themselves first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the bully bullies on, the world is too timid to take on the bully. Sound familiar?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan to take final call on T20 World Cup participation by next week</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969326/pakistan-to-take-final-call-on-t20-world-cup-participation-by-next-week</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD/LAHORE: Pakistan is expected to make a final decision by next week, over the cricket team’s participation in next month’s Twenty20 World Cup, keeping open the possibility of a boycott over Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;withdrawal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A decision was expected on Monday, when Interior Minister and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Mohsin Naqvi called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, no decision was announced after the meeting, and Naqvi instead issued a statement on X, saying the “final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi had thrown the team’s participation into doubt on Saturday, saying Pakistan could pull out after the International Cricket Council replaced Bangladesh in the tournament. He had said then that he was waiting for the prime minister to return from abroad before coming to a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PCB chief says decision could come by Friday, or next week&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the PM Office’s media team, Naqvi called on the prime minister on Monday and apprised the premier on the “International Cricket Council matter”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A source in the PM Office told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that even PM’s media team was not informed about the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A handout issued by the PMO, said: “During the meeting, he [interior minister] briefed the prime minister on the recent developments between the ICC and Bangl­adesh Cricket Board regarding the T20 World Cup.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PCB chief, meanwhile, stated that he had a “productive” meeting with PM Shehbaz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[I] briefed him on the ICC matter, and he directed that we resolve it while keeping all options on the table. It was agreed that the final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday,” the post read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-informed sources told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that Naqvi briefed the prime minister “on the positive and negative impacts of the options that can be adopted to show solidarity with Bangladesh”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A total boycott of the event is not the top priority, however, Pakistan could forfeit the group match against India to be held on Feb 15,” sources added. “For this, solid grounds are available to the PCB, which could avoid any sanctions or penalty on it from the ICC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sources pointed to the frosty ties between India and Pakistan, with the two countries having come to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509&quot;&gt;brink of war&lt;/a&gt; in May last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan can say it is following the instructions of the government in not playing against India. In that case, the ICC cannot impose any cash penalty or sanctions on PCB.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh with Scotland on Saturday following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governing ICC rejected Bangladesh’s request to move their matches to tournament co-host Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB has accepted the decision and said it will not be involved in further arbitration over the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have accepted the decision of the ICC board,” a BCB media official said in a statement. “Since the ICC has said that we cannot go and play or they cannot shift our games to Sri Lanka, in this case we cannot go and play in India. Our position remains the same. We are not going to any separate arbitration or anything here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had backed Bangladesh’s stance in Wednesday’s ICC Board virtual meeting, saying there was a precedence of relocating India’s matches on security fears from Pakistan in last year’s Champions Trophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then India, who have not toured Pakistan since 2008, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1894430&quot;&gt;played&lt;/a&gt; all their matches in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same option was given to Pakistan who will not tour India and play their World Cup matches in Sri Lanka under an agreement signed last year saying the two countries will play on neutral venues whenever one of them hosts an ICC event.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>World not ready for rise in extreme heat, scientists say</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969268/world-not-ready-for-rise-in-extreme-heat-scientists-say</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;PARIS: Nearly 3.8 billion people could face extreme heat by 2050 and while tropical countries will bear the brunt cooler regions will also need to adapt, scientists said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demand for cooling will “drastically” increase in giant countries like Brazil, Indonesia and Nigeria, where hundreds of millions of people lack air conditioning or other means of beating the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even a moderate increase in hotter days could have a “severe impact” in nations not used to such conditions like Canada, Russia and Finland, said scientists from the University of Oxford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a new study, they looked at different global warming scenarios to project how often people in future might experience temperatures considered uncomfortably hot or cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They found “that the population experiencing extreme heat conditions is projected to nearly double” by 2050 if global average temperatures rise 2C above preindustrial times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But most of the impact would be felt this decade as the world fast approaches the 1.5C mark, the study’s lead author Jesus Lizana said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The key takeaway from this is that the need for adaptation to extreme heat is more urgent than previously known,” said Lizana, an environmental scientist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“New infrastructure, such as sustainable air conditioning or passive cooling, needs to be built out within the next few years to ensure people can cope with dangerous heat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prolonged exposure to extreme heat can overwhelm the body’s natural cooling systems, causing symptoms ranging from dizziness and headaches to organ failure and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is called a silent killer because most heat deaths occur gradually as high temperatures and other environmental factors work together to undermine the body’s internal thermostat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Climate change is making heatwaves longer and stronger and access to cooling, especially air conditioning, will be vital in future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dangerously underprepared&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-025-01754-y&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the journal Nature Sustainability, projected that 3.79 billion people worldwide could be exposed to extreme heat by mid century.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would “drastically” increase energy demand for cooling in developing nations where the gravest health consequences would be felt. India, the Philippines and Bangladesh would be among biggest populations impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most significant change in “cooling degree days” temperatures hot enough to require cooling, such as air conditioning or fans were projected in tropical or equatorial countries, particularly in Africa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Central African Republic, Nigeria, South Sudan, Laos and Brazil saw the biggest rise in dangerously hot temperatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Put simply, the most disadvantaged people are the ones who will bare the brunt of this trend our study shows for ever hotter days,” climate scientist Radhika Khosla said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But wealthier countries in traditionally cooler climates also “face a major a problem even if many do not realise it yet”, she added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>BCCI vice-president Rajeev Shukla accused Pakistan of instigating Bangladesh&apos;s refusal to play T20 World Cup matches in India, leading to Scotland&apos;s inclusion in the tournament. Shukla asserted Bangladesh was assured of security, but Pakistan&apos;s &quot;intervention&quot; and &quot;misleading&quot; tactics aggravated the situation. This comes amid Pakistan&apos;s own deliberation over participating in the tournament.</description>

      <description>Cricket Scotland&apos;s CEO expressed sympathy for Bangladesh after their ICC Men&apos;s T20 World Cup 2026 replacement, acknowledging the unusual circumstances. Bangladesh were removed for refusing to play under the published schedule, a request the ICC denied due to security assurances. Scotland, ranked 14th, step in, despite their own qualification campaign not going as planned.</description>

      <title>Rs15bn tax rebate splits rice exporters</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969295/rs15bn-tax-rebate-splits-rice-exporters</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: At a time when rice exports are steadily declining, the Ministry of Commerce has allocated around Rs15 billion for a rebate scheme on local taxes and levies for rice exporters, raising concerns about a potential rise in domestic prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exporters remain divided over the government’s decision, which has been presented as a support measure for the sector. Several industry players, however, argue that the move fails to address the structural problems confronting rice exports and instead risks shifting the burden onto domestic consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan (REAP) Chairman Faisal Jahangir told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that the Drawback on Local Taxes and Levies (DLTL) scheme would help lower export prices and improve Pakistan’s ability to compete with global suppliers. He said Indian rice was currently being offered at significantly lower prices, making it difficult for Pakistani exporters to maintain their foothold in international markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics warn move could push up domestic prices, benefit stockists&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Jahangir said the rebate would help exporters maintain market share amid intense competition, adding that the support was intended to ease cost pressures faced by the industry. He rejected concerns that the scheme would push up domestic rice prices, maintaining that the rebate was designed to support exports rather than influence the local market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nine per cent rebate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a notification issued by the commerce ministry, exporters of basmati and brown rice are eligible for a rebate of 9 per cent of the free-on-board (FOB) value, provided the export price is equal to or above $750 per metric tonne. Other coarse rice qualifies for a lower rebate of 3pc of FOB value, but only where the export price remains below $750 per tonne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Karachi-based rice exporter told &lt;em&gt;Dawn&lt;/em&gt; that Pakistan’s bureaucracy has a long history of repeating policy mistakes dating back to the 1960s, relying on short-term measures such as rebates and subsidies to keep export sectors afloat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said these stopgap incentives have failed to deliver sustained growth, leaving exports largely stagnant despite repeated fiscal support. By contrast, he said regional competitors such as China, India, Bangladesh and Vietnam have focused on structural reforms to improve productivity, logistics and cost efficiency, enabling their exporters to compete more effectively in global markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exporters say rice exports have declined since the removal of the minimum export price due to higher cultivation, milling, financing and tax costs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to exporters, sustainable price competitiveness can only come from higher output and productivity, not from rent-based incentives that encourage speculative behaviour. In their view, reducing rice prices through increased production would generate real wealth across the value chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They point to India, noting that Indian rice prices, particularly basmati, have declined due to higher production, improved per-acre yields, and the development of new varieties that can be cultivated across different regions. Some exporters warn that the incentive could drive up domestic rice prices, benefiting stockists rather than exporters while squeezing consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also point out that linking rebates to FOB values instead of export volumes sends a price signal back into the domestic market, pushing up paddy procurement rates, particularly for basmati, where the rebate rises to 9pc above the $750 per tonne threshold.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>T20 World Cup: Naqvi briefs PM Shehbaz on ‘ICC matter’, says final decision to come by Friday or Monday</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969177/t20-world-cup-naqvi-briefs-pm-shehbaz-on-icc-matter-says-final-decision-to-come-by-friday-or-monday</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Monday said that he briefed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the “International Cricket Council (ICC) matter”, saying that a “final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a handout by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Naqvi had called on the premier in Islamabad earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the meeting, he briefed the prime minister on the recent situation regarding ICC T20 World Cup and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB),” the handout said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), stated that he had a “productive” meeting with PM Shehbaz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[I] briefed him on the ICC matter, and he directed that we resolve it while keeping all options on the table. It was agreed that the final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday,” the post read.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes as questions have been raised about Pakistan’s participation in the tournament following the ICC’s decision to replace Bangladesh with Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland on Saturday, which is scheduled to begin next month, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governing ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;rejected &lt;/a&gt;Bangladesh’s request to move their matches to tournament co-host Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours before the ICC had announced its decision, Naqvi had said that Bangladesh was being treated unfairly and should be allowed to participate in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, he had said that Pakistan’s participation was still not confirmed. “The prime minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I’ll be able to give you our final decision,” Naqvi had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the International Cricketers’ Association &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;on Sunday that the absence of Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup was a sad moment for the game and should serve as a call for stakeholders to work towards uniting the sport, not dividing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The withdrawal of Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup, and resulting absence of a valued cricketing nation from cricket’s pinnacle international T20 event, is a sad moment for our sport, the Bangladesh players and fans, and one that requires deep reflection,” World Cricketers’ Association (WCA) Chief Executive Tom Moffat had said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969177/t20-world-cup-naqvi-briefs-pm-shehbaz-on-icc-matter-says-detailed-decision-to-come-later</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Monday said that he had brieifed Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the “International Cricket Council (ICC) matter” saying, that a “final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a handout by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), Naqvi had called on the premier in Islamabad earlier today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Naqvi gave a detailed briefing to the prime minister on the current situation between the ICC T20 World Cup and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB),” the handout said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Naqvi, also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), stated that he had a “productive” meeting with PM Shehbaz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“[I] briefed him on the ICC matter, and he directed that we resolve it while keeping all options on the table. It was agreed that the final decision will be taken either on Friday or next Monday,” the post read.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland on Saturday in the tournament, which is scheduled to begin next month, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governing ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;rejected &lt;/a&gt;Bangladesh’s request to move their matches to tournament co-host Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hours before the ICC had announced its decision, Naqvi had said that Bangladesh was being treated unfairly and should be allowed to participate in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, he had said that Pakistan’s participation was still not confirmed. “The prime minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I’ll be able to give you our final decision,” Naqvi had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the International Cricketers’ Association &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;said &lt;/a&gt;on Sunday that the absence of Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup was a sad moment for the game and should serve as a call for stakeholders to work towards uniting the sport, not dividing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The withdrawal of Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup, and resulting absence of a valued cricketing nation from cricket’s pinnacle international T20 event, is a sad moment for our sport, the Bangladesh players and fans, and one that requires deep reflection,” World Cricketers’ Association (WCA) Chief Executive Tom Moffat had said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh review alleges massive overpricing in Adani power pact</title>

      <description>A Bangladesh government committee said on Monday it had found &quot;egregious anomalies&quot; in a billion-dollar cross-border electricity supply deal with Indian conglomerate Adani, providing around 10 percent of the country&apos;s power. The National Review Committee on Power Purchase Agreements said it had found &quot;examples of egregious anomalies&quot;, that meant the state-owned Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) was paying up to 50 percent more than it should.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh court sentences ex-police chief, 2 others to death for 2024 protest crackdown</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1969171/bangladesh-court-sentences-ex-police-chief-2-others-to-death-for-2024-protest-crackdown</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Bangladesh court on Monday sentenced Dhaka’s fugitive former police chief and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1852020#:~:text=It%20also%20named%20detective%20branch%20chief%20Harun%2Dor%2DRashid&quot;&gt;two senior colleagues&lt;/a&gt; to be hanged for crimes against humanity committed during the rule of ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All three, including the capital’s former police chief, Habibur Rahman, were tried in absentia, and their whereabouts are not known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The verdict comes ahead of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968417&quot;&gt;elections on February 12&lt;/a&gt;, the first in the South Asian country of 170 million people since Hasina’s overthrow in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five other ex-police officers were sentenced to varying terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1852020/bangladesh-court-opens-murder-case-against-ex-premier-sheikh-hasina&quot;&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; concerned the killing of six protesters in Dhaka on August 5, 2024, the day Hasina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief&quot;&gt;fled to India&lt;/a&gt; as protesters stormed her palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Up to 1,400 people were killed between July and August 2024 when Hasina’s government launched a brutal campaign to silence the protesters, according to the United Nations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The police forces… opened fire with lethal weapons… causing death to the aforesaid six persons,” judge Golam Mortuza Mozumder read to the court in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court heard how Rahman sent messages to police units ordering the use of lethal force to crush the protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chief prosecutor Tajul Islam said he was satisfied with the verdict against the three men, although he wanted tougher sentences for the five others found guilty who were handed prison terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The court said their crimes have been proved and they committed crimes against humanity,” Islam told the reporters after the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, the same court also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced Hasina&lt;/a&gt; — who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969057/bangladesh-slams-india-over-hasinas-speech&quot;&gt;remains in hiding&lt;/a&gt; in India — to death for crimes against humanity. She refused to attend the trial and denies the charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that case, former interior minister Asaduzzaman Khan Kamal was also sentenced to death in absentia after being found guilty of crimes against humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ex-police chief Chowdhury Abdullah Al-Mamun, who was in court and had pleaded guilty, was sentenced to five years’ imprisonment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Bangladesh Cricket Board has accepted the ICC&apos;s decision to replace them with Scotland in the T20 World Cup after the government refused to clear the team for travel to India due to security concerns.

      <title>CORPORATE WINDOW : Heading toward a cliff</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968944/corporate-window-heading-toward-a-cliff</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a peculiar ritual in Islamabad whenever the European Union extends the Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) status. Bureaucrats congratulate one another, press releases claim a diplomatic victory, and the textile sector breathes a collective sigh of relief. This self-congratulation, however, masks a dangerous complacency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the extension of the GSP+ regime until 2027 has provided a temporary lifeline, the mood in Brussels is shifting. The recent warnings from the European Union (EU) Ambassador — stating that Pakistan needs to do more — are not merely diplomatic pleasantries. As we inch closer to the 2027 expiration, Pakistan faces a dual threat: a stagnant domestic human rights record as per GSP+ standards and a rapidly evolving, more protectionist Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For over a decade, GSP+ has been the single most effective economic steroid for Pakistan. The numbers tell the story of a desperate reliance. Since the status was granted in 2014, Pakistan’s exports to the EU have surged by nearly 92 per cent, rising from $4.7 billion in 2014 to approximately $9bn in the FY25 fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Union is now our second most important trading partner, absorbing nearly 28pc of our total exports. For an economy gasping for foreign exchange and struggling with a chronic balance of payments crisis, duty-free access to the single market is not a luxury; it is oxygen. Without GSP+, our key export — especially textiles, which make up over 75pc of our EU-bound shipments — would face the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariffs of roughly 12pc. In an industry where margins are measured in cents, that surcharge would mean a death sentence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As we inch closer to the 2027 expiration date of the GSP+ regime, Pakistan faces the dual threat of a stagnant domestic human rights record and a more protectionist Europe&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, we treat this privilege as a permanent entitlement rather than a conditional incentive. The first crack in the foundation is the widening gap between legislation and implementation. While Islamabad takes comfort in having ratified the requisite 27 international conventions, Brussels is no longer interested in signatures. They are looking at the application of laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requirements for the post-2027 regime are set to become far more rigorous. The list of mandatory conventions is expected to expand from 27 to 32. New additions will likely include stricter adherence to the Paris Agreement on climate change and protocols against transnational organized crime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, our compliance record is flashing red. Their perceived suppression of digital rights and internet freedom is now a trade issue. A Europe dealing with war on its own continent is not willing to relax the suppression of civil liberties in other regions. The upcoming monitoring mission will likely be the decisive factor for our re-application in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Pakistan congratulates itself on $9bn in exports, our competitors are playing a different game. Vietnam, once a peer, has left us in the dust. In 2023 alone, Vietnam’s exports to the EU topped $50bn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did they do it? While Pakistan relied on GSP+ to sell basic bed linen and towels, Vietnam negotiated a full Free Trade Agreement that came into effect in 2020. They diversified beyond textiles into electronics and machinery. Even within textiles, Vietnam and Bangladesh have aggressively pivoted to man-made fibres, which now command a larger share of the global market than cotton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan remains addicted to cotton-based low-value exports. Bangladesh, holding a 21pc share of the EU’s non-EU apparel market compared to our single digits, is already preparing for its graduation from the ‘least developed countries’ status by negotiating new partnership terms. Meanwhile, we are standing still on a moving walkway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second, and perhaps more lethal threat, is the changing political and legal anatomy of Europe itself. The Europe of 2025 is not the Europe of 2014. A rightward shift across the continent — ushering in a new era of economic protectionism — is coinciding with the EU’s new Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This directive changes the playing field entirely. It holds European companies legally liable for environmental and human rights violations in their supply chains. If a factory in Faisalabad dumps untreated water or relies on underpaid contract labor, the liability now travels all the way to a retailer in Berlin. European buyers are already risk-averse; facing potential lawsuits at home, they will not hesitate to cut off Pakistani suppliers that cannot prove impeccable compliance standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s textile industry needs to understand that the days of competing solely on price are ending; the new competition is on compliance. While advocating for an enabling environment is, indeed, warranted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to secure the GSP+ lifeline beyond 2027, the government must urgently address the uncompetitive energy costs crippling the value-added textile sector. Currently, Pakistani exporters pay an average industrial tariff of 13.2 cents/kWh, significantly higher than regional competitors like Vietnam (7.0 cents), India (9.5 cents), and Bangladesh (10.2 cents).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This 30–80pc energy cost premium erodes the 9.6pc duty advantage offered by GSP+. Immediate governmental support is required to remove cross-subsidies through decoupling industrial tariffs from residential subsidies to achieve a regionally competitive rate of 9 cents/kWh. Additionally, zero-rated status should be restored in a way that automates sales tax refunds to resolve the liquidity crunch preventing modernization in knitting and finishing units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are sleepwalking toward a cliff. If Pakistan loses GSP+ in 2027, or if we fail to qualify for the successor arrangement due to our inability to meet the new Plus requirements, the economic shock would be catastrophic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government must stop viewing GSP+ as a trade negotiation and start viewing it as a domestic reform agenda. Diplomatic lobbying can buy time, and it has bought us until 2027. But it cannot buy compliance. The window is closing. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A socially compromised people</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968935/a-socially-compromised-people</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The digitally conducted Household Integrated Economic Survey (HIES) FY25 helps explain Pakistan’s dangerously high public discontent, along with the risks and opportunities the situation entails. A more informed and connected population trapped in economic stagnation creates fertile ground for populism, criminal and terrorist networks. Yet, with timely policy shifts that unlock sustained growth, the same awareness and connectivity could drive rapid development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost universal connectivity, rapid digitisation, and access to limitless online information have dismantled the old notion that deprivation is a matter of fate. Greater public exposure to comforts online has sparked aspirations and increased awareness of wealth and income disparity and opportunity gaps. While the desire to improve life and living standards is powerful, the absence of a clear pathway for personal growth and career advancement pushes many towards shortcuts, often blurring ethical boundaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The latest HIES shows little progress in key social and economic indicators since the FY19 survey. Literacy rose only marginally from 60 per cent to 63pc, while the share of out-of-school children aged 5-16 declined slightly from 30pc to 28pc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Health outcomes improved marginally: better immunisation coverage, pre- and post-natal care, and access to skilled birth attendants helped reduce neonatal and infant mortality, yet rates remain high at 35 and 47 per thousand live births, respectively. Gains in housing quality, access to piped water and sanitation are simply limited and male employment rates have dropped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pakistan has become one of the region’s most digitally connected societies, yet social progress remains slow and male employment has fallen&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the survey records a dramatic surge in digital connectivity. Household internet access more than doubled from 34pc in FY19 to 70pc in FY25. Mobile phone ownership reached 96pc of households, with 98pc of urban households connected to the internet. Individual internet use rose sharply from 17pc to 57pc over the period.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Better-informed individuals can clearly see the gap between their living standards and those of the wealthy. This sense of ‘relative deprivation’ is a powerful source of discontent. People increasingly recognise that their circumstances are not merely the result of personal failure but stem from broader structural problems, including political patronage, unfair systems, wage stagnation, limited access to affordable education, and discrimination. This awareness fuels frustration with the existing order, replacing passive acceptance with growing resentment,” remarked an analyst anonymously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Despite private security and state-of-the-art safeguards at my home and factories, I don’t feel safe,” a leading business tycoon said, reflecting on Bangladesh’s 2024 youth uprising. “I fear the anger of a large pool of frustrated young people turning against those seen as successful. I don’t believe that the state could protect the elite if mob fury spills over. I‘ve already moved my family abroad and am exploring options to shift part of my business to the West.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I believe the risk of public backlash spiralling into an anarchic situation is real. The government must act swiftly to stabilise the economy and pursue a more inclusive growth model. The elite should also curb conspicuous consumption to avoid provoking public resentment. Businesses, meanwhile, need to abandon the practice of suppressing wages, which form only a small share of costs and are already far below global norms, and start respecting employees’ right to dignified living,” a leading businessman said privately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, an Islamabad-based economist questioned, “Are the HIES findings even credible? Can a sample survey truly reflect on-ground reality?” The survey, conducted by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), covers 2,343 enumeration blocks and 32,785 households nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Defended the HIES methodology, PBS’s chief statistician, Dr Naeem uz Zafar, noted that the high mobile penetration is corroborated by the Pakistan Telecommunication Agency. He acknowledged the puzzling decline in male employment, partly reflected in gig work captured by the Labour Force Survey FY25. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added that while enrolment gains appear modest, improving gender parity and stronger female participation in education indicate greater human capital gains for women. Improvements in family planning and maternal, newborn, and child health indicators, he said, also point to growing awareness and better health outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A formal cabinet response on the HIES did not arrive by the deadline, but Dr Nadeem Javed, Vice Chancellor, Pakistan Institute of Development Economics, described the survey as revealing “a striking paradox”: Pakistan has become one of the region’s most digitally connected societies, with near universal mobile ownership and about 70pc internet access, yet social progress remains slow and male employment has fallen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He attributed this to household economic stress in recent years. While household incomes rose by roughly 97pc, household spending climbed faster, about 133pc, driven largely by higher electricity, gas and health costs. This squeezed spending on food, education and small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Digital access on its own could not offset these pressures. Without digital work and commerce, connectivity remains a convenience rather than a livelihood,” he argued. “As recovery takes hold, policy must pivot from access to opportunity, linking connectivity with skills, online work, digital trade and small business growth to translate reach into productivity, incomes and human development,” Dr Javed added. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>The World Cricketers&apos; Association expressed disappointment over Bangladesh&apos;s withdrawal from the T20 World Cup, calling it a &quot;sad moment&quot; and urging &quot;deep reflection.&quot; The ICC replaced Bangladesh with Scotland after the BCB&apos;s request to move matches to Sri Lanka was rejected, citing security concerns. The WCA highlighted broader trends of agreements not being honored and a lack of player consultation.</description>

      <title>Babar, Shaheen to play for Pakistan in T20 World Cup; Haris Rauf left out</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968995/babar-shaheen-to-play-for-pakistan-in-t20-world-cup-haris-rauf-left-out</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) left out express pacer Haris Rauf from the 15-man squad named on Sunday for next month’s ICC T20 World Cup jointly hosted by India and Sri Lanka, although former captains Babar Azam and Shaheen Shah Afridi were named.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The announcement was made in a press conference by PCB High Performance Director and member of the men’s national selection committee Aaqib Javed, who was speaking alongside skipper Salman and white-ball head coach Michael James Hesson at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 32-year-old Rauf finished with 20 wickets in the Big Bash League in Australia, but selector Aaqib Javed said he doesn’t fit in the combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rauf has played a lot of cricket for Pakistan, but we kept conditions in Sri Lanka in mind while selecting the squad,” Javed told a press conference in Lahore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rauf is also the highest wicket-taker for Pakistan in T20I cricket with 133 in 94 matches.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the players, Salman, Faheem Ashraf, Khawaja Mohammad Nafay, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Sahibzada Farhan and Usman Tariq have received their maiden mega-event call-ups to the Pakistan squad, PCB said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Abrar Ahmed, Babar, Fakhar Zaman, Mohammad Nawaz, Naseem Shah, Saim Ayub, Shaheen, Shadab Khan and Usman Khan have played in at least one or more editions of the tournament since 2021, the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the 20-team tournament, each team is set to play four group games before the Super Eight and Knockout Stage, all between February 7 and March 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan are also set to face Australia in a three-match T20I series at Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore on January 29, 31 and Feb 1, with the preparation camp starting today, the PCB statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Babar and Shaheen were also named in Pakistan’s squad for the three-match series after being dropped from the T20I series against Sri Lanka last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked during the presser about Babar’s inclusion in the World Cup squad despite “not meeting international standards”, Javed said he has been “the most consistent batsman”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Babar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968416&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he would miss the remainder of the Big Bash League in Australia since he had been recalled to Pakistan for a national team camp ahead of the T20I series with Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman, on being asked if Pakistan stood to gain an advantage similar to “the way India did during the previous ICC Champions Trophy, as all their matches were in the UAE,” the captain admitted that Pakistan did have an advantage this time. However, he maintained that winning depended on whether the team played well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“India won because they played good cricket. If we do the same, we will win as well,” Salman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2025, a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;hybrid model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” was decided upon whereby India played all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1894430#:~:text=The%20deal%20means%20Pakistan%20will%20play%20at%20a%20neutral%20venue%20in%20any%20ICC%20tournament%20hosted%20by%20India%20until%202027.&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;compromise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan are set to play all their matches at the upcoming T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, though PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday their participation was still not confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman further said that “in the past three tournaments, the team had not performed well”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued: “When you play a world cup, it is always going to be tough[..] you can not stay relaxed in any situation [..] it will be challenging, and we are both ready and excited for it”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked “why Muhammad Rizwan was not chosen to be in the squad despite having more experience in Sri Lanka than Babar,” Javed said, “You have to take into account the batting composition of your team — both the coach and captain think that babar can play a vital role in the team — so it does not mean that one is being given a chance and the other is not, we have to look at how the team can have a more competiteive batting line up”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He went on to say that the argument had “no logic”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You have to look at who fits better in the squad and which player can make the team better,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head coach Hesson, responding to a question about the inclusion of Khawaja Nafay and Usman Khan as the wicket keepers despite Nafay’s “inexperience, and Usman’s “poor performance”, maintained that “Usman Khan has been exceptional since he has come back in the squad”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“His wicket-keeping has probably been better than expected,” Hesson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He continued: “As for Khawaja Nafay, we looked at Sahibzada Farhan as the backup keeper, but unfortunately, he became a bit vulnerable to injury with the extra load from a keeping perspective. That was something we did not want to risk”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The head coach stressed that Farhan was a “big player” for the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that we would have to put him in a difficult situation forced our hand a little bit [..] that is where Nafay came in as a power player through the middle,” the head coach said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are very comfortable with the two keeping options we have,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman, in response to a question over whether Babar’s “performance was a cause for concern”, said that the player’s performance “has not been as bad as you people show, his big bash did not go well, but that is a different condition”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think since his comeback, he has been performing well in the T20s and all that matters to me is that he performs well for Pakistan,” the captain added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailing the batting plan, the captain said that only the “other than the openers, the rest can only be decided upon the given situation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In T20, other than openers, you have no idea what situation you will find yourself in,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about the line-up, Javed maintained that it was the same squad “which had been in continuity for the past three to four series”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is not like we have formed a special or different team for the World Cup; however, different conditions are always taken into account, and changes can be made,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head coach Hesson, talking about Rauf’s exclusion from the squad, said, “Firstly, when we decided to take three seamers to Sri Lanka, there is obviously going to be some unlucky seamers, and Waseem Junior, Ahmed Daniyal, and Haris Rauf are three that were certainly considered, but there was no spot unfortunately”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said that the three seamers included in the squad — Shaheen Shah Afridi, Salman Mirza, and Naseem Shah — “can bowl in all three phases of the game”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further added: “Previous World Cups, we have always taken an extra seamer because conditions have dictated that, whereas in this situation we haven’t gone down that path”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailing Babar’s role in the squad, the head coach stated, “We see a very different role for Babar than what you have in the BBL”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Babar Azam has a lot of other skills to offer,” he said, recalling that the decision to add Babar was also taken “to complement the other players we have”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know what a world-class player he is and how flexible he can be, depending on what the team requires,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On being asked about a potential boycott of the World Cup by Pakistan, following a statement made by the chairman PCB, Javed said that their role was limited to selecting the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Ultimately, it is up to the government to decide, and we will wait for their decision,” said Javed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day earlier, ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793/t20-world-cup-naqvi-rues-unfair-treatment-of-bangladesh-says-one-country-cannot-dictate-another&quot;&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Scotland would replace Bangladesh at the T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player, Mustafizur Rahman, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, who is also Chairman PCB, when asked about a potential boycott of the World Cup, said the government of Pakistan would make the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are waiting for the prime minister to return,” he said, adding that a final decision would be taken then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15-member squad for T20 World Cup:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman Ali Agha (captain), Abrar Ahmed, Babar Azam, Faheem Ashraf, Fakhar Zaman, Khawaja Mohammad Nafay (wk), Mohammad Nawaz, Mohammad Salman Mirza, Naseem Shah, Sahibzada Farhan (wk), Saim Ayub, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Shadab Khan, Usman Khan (wk) and Usman Tariq.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh absence from T20 World Cup a sad moment for the game: International Cricketers’ Association</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999/bangladesh-absence-from-t20-world-cup-a-sad-moment-for-the-game-international-cricketers-association</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The absence of Bangladesh from next month’s T20 World Cup is a sad moment for the game and should serve as a call for stakeholders to work towards uniting the sport, not dividing it, the International Cricketers’ Association said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the 20-team showpiece on Saturday following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) rejected Bangladesh’s request to move their matches to tournament co-host Sri Lanka, saying it was not feasible to change the schedule so close to the February 7 start of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The withdrawal of Bangladesh from the T20 World Cup, and resulting absence of a valued cricketing nation from cricket’s pinnacle international T20 event, is a sad moment for our sport, the Bangladesh players and fans, and one that requires deep reflection,” World Cricketers’ Association (WCA) Chief Executive Tom Moffat said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Rather than allowing division or exclusion to take hold, we call on the games’ leaders to work with all stakeholders, including governing bodies, leagues and players, to unite the sport, not divide it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The events underline the current tension in South Asian cricket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s fraught relations with Pakistan prompted the ICC to broker an arrangement allowing them to play at a neutral venue when their neighbour hosts a global tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following India’s refusal to travel to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy in 2025, a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;hybrid model&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” was decided upon whereby India played all its matches in Dubai, chosen as a neutral venue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As per the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1894430#:~:text=The%20deal%20means%20Pakistan%20will%20play%20at%20a%20neutral%20venue%20in%20any%20ICC%20tournament%20hosted%20by%20India%20until%202027.&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;compromise&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistan are set to play all their matches at the upcoming T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, though the Pakistan Cricket Board chief Mohsin Naqvi said on Saturday their participation was still not confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The prime minister is not in Pakistan right now. When he returns, I’ll be able to give you our final decision,” Naqvi, who is also the country’s interior minister, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moffat said the WCA had become increasingly concerned by agreements not being honoured in the sport and by a lack of meaningful consultation with players and their representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It also highlights significant issues with the game’s existing operating model at the global level,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These issues, if continued to be left unaddressed, will weaken trust, unity, and ultimately the health and future of the game we love.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Pakistani captain and all-rounder Shahid Afridi said on the replacement of Bangladesh by Scotland that he was “deeply disappointed” by ICC’s “inconsistency”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As a former international cricketer who has played in Bangladesh and in ICC events, I’m deeply disappointed by today’s ICC’s inconsistency. It accepted India’s security concerns for not touring Pakistan in 2025, yet appears unwilling to apply the same understanding to Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Consistency and fairness are the foundation of global cricket governance. Bangladesh’s players and millions of its fans deserve respect — not mixed standards. The ICC should build bridges, not burn them,” Afridi said in a post on social media platform X.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Pakistani batsman Mohammad Yousaf expressed similar views, saying: “Very sad to see a cricket-loving nation like Bangladesh being deprived of cricket due to security concerns not being addressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When similar concerns were raised earlier, a neutral venue was approved. Standards cannot change from country to country. ICC must act as the International Cricket Council, not appear to serve the interests of any single board. Fairness and consistency are the foundation of global cricket.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Former Australian cricketer Jason Gillespie has criticized the ICC&apos;s decision to remove Bangladesh from the 2026 Men&apos;s T20 World Cup. He questioned the lack of consistency, drawing parallels to India being allowed to play the 2025 Champions Trophy at a neutral venue due to security concerns in Pakistan. This decision has sparked wider unease within the cricketing community.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh says ex-captain Shakib Al Hasan can return for national team selection</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968993/bangladesh-says-ex-captain-shakib-al-hasan-can-return-for-national-team-selection</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh cricket chiefs have reopened the door for ex-captain Shakib Al Hasan’s return, a star player but who was also a lawmaker in the former ruling party overthrown in a 2024 uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shakib’s links to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ousted&lt;/a&gt; leader Sheikh Hasina made him a target of public anger, and he was among dozens facing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1855049&quot;&gt;murder investigations&lt;/a&gt; for a deadly police crackdown on protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The all-rounder announced his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1861266&quot;&gt;retirement&lt;/a&gt; from international cricket in 2024, but said he would like to reverse that decision last month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) senior official Amzad Hossain said he could play again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board has taken a unanimous decision that if Shakib Al Hasan’s availability, fitness and accessibility allow it — and if he can be present at the venue where matches are played — then the board and the selection panel will consider him for the national team,” Hossain told reporters late Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the BCB would issue Shakib no-objection certificates (NOC) to play in overseas leagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If he wants to participate in other global tournaments, the board will provide him NOC as required,” Amzad added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shakib had earlier apologised for remaining silent during the student-led uprising but defended his decision to serve the regime it toppled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh cricket is reeling from being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;kicked out&lt;/a&gt; of next month’s T20 World Cup, after the International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday replaced Bangladesh with Scotland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to send its players to India and pleaded for games to be shifted to co-host Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dispute between New Delhi and Dhaka erupted this month when the Indian cricket board ordered the Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;release&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it had found no credible security threat to Bangladesh in India, but the BCB said the matter was beyond their control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a government decision taken on security grounds,” Amzad said. “Because of that, there was nothing more we could do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shakib was playing in a domestic Twenty20 cricket competition in Canada when Hasina’s government collapsed and has not returned to Bangladesh since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left-arm allrounder has played 71 Tests, 247 one-day internationals and 129 Twenty20s for Bangladesh, taking a combined 712 wickets.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Trade gap with nine neighbours widens 44.4pc in first half</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968925/trade-gap-with-nine-neighbours-widens-444pc-in-first-half</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan’s trade deficit with nine neighbouring countries widened by 44.42 per cent to $7.683 billion in the first half of FY26 compared to $5.320bn during the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The soaring deficit was mainly due to a decline in Pakistan’s overall exports to regional countries, led by a drop in shipments to China, followed by Afghanistan and Bangla­desh. Pakistan has suspended all kinds of trade, including exports, with Afghanistan since Oct 10, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In percentage terms, exports to India increased marginally, but in value terms, it is negligible. The shipments to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka registered negative growth during the period under review, according to the latest data compiled by the State Bank. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In FY25, the trade deficit with these nine neighbouring countries widened by 29.42pc to $12.297bn, up from $9.502bn in the preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The value of exports to Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives dipped 18.56pc to $1.965bn in July-December FY26 from $2.413bn over the same period last year. Contrary to this, imports surged 24.76pc to $9.648bn in 6MFY26 from $7.733bn over the same period last year. Imports surged 20.66pc to $16.698bn in FY25 from $13.838bn over the preceding year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Imports from China grew by 25.61pc to $9.472bn in 6MFY26 from $7.541bn over the same period last year. The bulk of imports in the region is sourced from China, followed partially by India and Bangladesh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exports to China fell by 5.59pc to $1.216bn in 6MFY26 from $1.288bn over the same period last year. Imports from India dipped by 12.73pc to $97.734m in 6MFY26 from $111.991m over the last year. In FY25, imports from India increased to $220.58m from $206.89m over the last year. Meanwhile, exports to India remained at $2.926m in 6MFY26, up from $0.399m over the last year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exports to Afghanistan dipped 56.61pc to $219.489m in 6MFY26 from $505.818m last year. Imports stood at $6.321m in 6MFY26 against $9.994m in FY25, a drop of 36.75pc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exports to Bangladesh declined by 7.54pc to $358.499m in 6MFY26 from $387.772m over the last year. In FY25, exports to Bangladesh increased by 19.08pc to $787.35m from $661.19m. Imports grew 7.41pc to $36.882m in 6MFY26 from $39.832m over the last year.  Exports to Sri Lanka dipped by 27.13pc to $163.173m in 6MFY26 from $223.912m over the last year. Imports, however, rose 12.71pc to $33.414m in 6MFY26 from $29.647m over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;

He argued that linking participation to an IPL player&apos;s exclusion was misguided, as ICC events boast superior security. Haque warned this move jeopardizes Bangladesh cricket&apos;s progress, with Scotland now replacing them.</description>

      <title>Scotland to replace Bangladesh at T20 World Cup, ICC announces</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793/scotland-to-replace-bangladesh-at-t20-world-cup-icc-announces</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Saturday announced that Scotland would replace Bangladesh at the T20 World Cup, which is scheduled to be held in India next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka, which the council had rejected. However, Bangladesh had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;insisted &lt;/a&gt;it would not travel to India for the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/news/scotland-to-replace-bangladesh-at-t20-world-cup&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt;posted on its website on Saturday, the ICC stated that the decision was made in the absence of “any credible or verifiable security threat” to the Bangladesh national team in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Scotland has been called up to take Bangladesh’s place in Group C, joining England, Italy, Nepal and the West Indies,” the ICC announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC noted that Scotland, ranked the 14th-highest T20 team in the world, was selected since they were the next-highest ranked team after Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement further said that the governing body rejected the Bangladesh Cricket Board’s (BCB) request to move their matches from India to Sri Lanka, who are co-hosts of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Independent security assessments were conducted from internal and external experts,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The [ICC] Board made the difficult decision that it was not feasible to meet the BCB’s requests so close to the tournament,” the ICC stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The decision follows an extensive process undertaken by the ICC to address concerns raised by the BCB regarding the hosting of its scheduled matches in India,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engagement between the ICC and the BCB took place over more than three weeks, the statement outlined, adding that multiple rounds of dialogue were conducted “in a transparent and constructive manner” with meetings held both via video link and in person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As part of this process, the ICC reviewed the concerns cited by the BCB, commissioned and considered independent security assessments from internal and external experts, and shared detailed security and operational plans covering federal and state arrangements, as well as enhanced and escalating security protocols for the event,” the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These assurances were reiterated at several stages, including during discussions involving the ICC Business Corporation (IBC) Board. The ICC’s assessments concluded that there was no credible or verifiable security threat to the Bangladesh national team, officials or supporters in India,” it stated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on the findings, cricket’s governing body determined that it was “not appropriate” to amend or change the tournament’s schedule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the statement added that following a meeting on Wednesday, the BCB was granted 24 hours to confirm its participation in India as scheduled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As no confirmation was received within the deadline, the ICC proceeded in line with its established governance and qualification processes to identify a replacement team,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#naqvi-rues-unfair-treatment-of-bangladesh&quot; id=&quot;naqvi-rues-unfair-treatment-of-bangladesh&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Naqvi rues unfair treatment of Bangladesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that Bangladesh was being treated unfairly and should be allowed to participate in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, made the remarks while speaking to the media in Lahore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his media talk, Naqvi said that the PCB’s stance on the situation would be according to the government of Pakistan’s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheRealPCB/status/2015034965403271588&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh has been treated unfairly. I said the same in the board meeting of the ICC. You cannot have double standards, where one country can make whatever decision whenever and do the total opposite for another country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is why we have taken the stand that Bangladesh is being treated unfairly and should be allowed to play the World Cup in any case. They are a major stakeholder and this injustice should not be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about a potential boycott of the World Cup, he said the government of Pakistan would make the decision. “We are waiting for the prime minister to return,” he said, adding that a final decision would be taken then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also asked whether he would suggest to the ICC a hybrid model for Bangladesh, similar to the one between Pakistan and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The thing is that Bangladesh is the same member as Pakistan. And our stance is that if you have done this favour with Pakistan and India, then you should do the same with Bangladesh,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The main reason for this is that one country cannot dictate another. And if this dictation is attempted, then Pakistan definitely has its own stance,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether there was a “Plan B” for a scenario in which Pakistan would also not play the T20 World Cup, he quipped, “Let the decision come first; we have Plan A, B, C, D.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi said Pakistan’s participation in the T20 World Cup will depend on the government’s decision after Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland. He stated that Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif will take the final call once he returns. Naqvi criticised the ICC for unfairly treating Bangladesh, questioned selective decision-making, and stressed that the PCB follows only government directives, leaving Pakistan’s participation uncertain.</description>

      <title>T20 World Cup: Naqvi rues unfair treatment of Bangladesh, says ‘one country cannot dictate another’</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793/t20-world-cup-naqvi-rues-unfair-treatment-of-bangladesh-says-one-country-cannot-dictate-another</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday said that Bangladesh, which has refused to play the T20 World Cup scheduled in India, was being treated unfairly and should be allowed to participate in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi, who is also the chairman of the Pakistan Cricket Board, made the remarks while speaking to media in Lahore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the ICC rejected the country’s request to shift its games. However, Bangladesh has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413&quot;&gt;insisted &lt;/a&gt;it will not travel to India for the tournament, effectively ruling the country out of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also worth mentioning that reports have &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/icc-replaces-bangladesh-with-scotland-at-t20-world-cup-due-to-bcb-refusal-to-play-in-india-1520550&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;emerged &lt;/a&gt;regarding Scotland replacing Bangladesh in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his media talk, Naqvi said that the PCB’s stance on the situation would be according to the government of Pakistan’s instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/TheRealPCB/status/2015034965403271588&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh has been treated unfairly. I said the same in the board meeting of the International Cricket Council (ICC). You cannot have double standards, where one country can make whatever decision whenever and do the total opposite for another country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is why we have taken the stand that Bangladesh is being treated unfairly and should be allowed to play the World Cup in any case. They are a major stakeholder and this injustice should not be done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about a potential boycott of the World Cup, he said the government of Pakistan would make the decision. “We are waiting for the prime minister to return,” he said, adding that a final decision would be taken then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was also asked whether he would suggest to the ICC a hybrid model for Bangladesh, similar to the one between Pakistan and India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The thing is that Bangladesh is the same member as Pakistan. And our stance is that if you have done this favour with Pakistan and India, then you should do the same with Bangladesh,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The main reason for this is that one country cannot dictate another. And if this dictation is attempted, then Pakistan definitely has its own stance,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked whether there was a “Plan B” for a scenario in which Pakistan would also not play the T20 World Cup, he quipped, “Let the decision come first; we have Plan A, B, C, D.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>KU conference stresses integrated solutions to tackle environmental challenges</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968695/ku-conference-stresses-integrated-solutions-to-tackle-environmental-challenges</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;KARACHI: Highlighting multiple challenges being faced at the global and national level, speakers at an international conference held on Friday at Karachi University (KU) underscored the need for sustainable, integrated solutions designed through research, innovation and collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference — Sustainable Green Energy, Environment, and Digital Innovations — was jointly organised by KU’s Department of Chemical Engineering and the Institution of Engineers Pakistan (IEP).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prof Iqbal Muhammad Mujtaba, associated with the University of Bradford (UK), said societies were needed to move toward sustainable, resilient, intelligent, and harmonious systems, with near-zero water and soil pollution, as climate change, environmental degradation and resource shortages intensified.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“River basins shared by multiple countries—such as India and Bangladesh, and India and Pakistan—require not only scientific and technological expertise but also continuous and effective political dialogue between governments,” he stressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting the need for water conservation, he said a 10-minute shower consumed about 90 litres of water, while a bathtub used 190 litres. Reducing shower time to five minutes could save 45–50 per cent of water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On food waste, he cited the UN data showing that in 2020, households worldwide discarded nearly one billion meals daily, while 783 million people faced hunger and one-third of the global population experienced food insecurity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Producing wasted food consumes 250,000 cubic meters of water and 1.4bn hectares of land (28pc of global agricultural land). It also contributes 3.3bn tons of CO-equivalent greenhouse gases annually,” he told the audience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his remarks, Chairman IEP-Karachi Centre Engr Muhammad Farooq Arabi said the conference’s theme held extraordinary importance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today’s unprecedented challenges—climate change, energy insecurity, environmental degradation, and rapid digital transformation—require integrated, modern, and sustainable digital solutions, not isolated measures,” he said, emphasising that local scientists should play their role in promoting clean renewable energy and protecting the environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President IEP Engr Sohail Bashir stated that national institutions and universities noted that future engineering solutions would not emerge from individual efforts but rather through strong collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Today’s world needs responsible progress, sustainable innovation and the technology that serves humanity and protects the planet.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He noted that Pakistan stood at a critical juncture with one of the youngest populations globally, a rapidly growing engineering workforce, and immense potential in renewable energy resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We have the strong foundations needed for sustainable transformation, which can be realised through effective policy, research, and collaboration.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr Samreen Hussain, vice chancellor of Dawood University of Engineering and Technology, talked about the need to properly dispose of e-waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to her, the world generated 62m e-waste in 2022, which is expected to increase to 82m in 2030.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“As AI-driven waste management systems, robotic disassembly methods, and green energy solutions are being introduced, the rapid pace of digital technology produces new devices daily, further adding to e-waste,” she noted, adding that while many countries had adopted policies for effective e-waste management, Pakistan lagged far behind. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Hasina alleges Bangladesh elections will not be free</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968714/hasina-alleges-bangladesh-elections-will-not-be-free</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI: Bangla­desh’s former leader Sheikh Hasina alleged on Friday that elections next month would not be free or fair, in her first public speech since being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to death in absentia for crimes against humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nation of 170 million people votes on Feb 12 to choose a new leadership after prolonged political turmoil following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;overthrow&lt;/a&gt; of Hasina’s autocratic government in Aug 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, 78, fled to India after a student-led uprising ended her 15-year, iron-fisted rule, and has not been seen in public since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her speech is likely to further aggravate ties between New Delhi and Dhaka, which have soured since her ouster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh stands today at the edge of an abyss, a nation battered and bleeding,” Hasina said in English during an audio message broadcast to a packed press club in the Indian capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Democracy is now in exile,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, Hasina was found guilty by a Dhaka court of incitement, order to kill and inaction to prevent atrocities, and sentenced to be hanged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The activities of her former ruling Awami League, once the country’s most popular party, have been outlawed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh must defend and restore the constitution written in the blood of martyrs, reclaim our independence, safeguard our sovereignty, and revive our democracy,” Hasina said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who returned from exile after Sheikh Hasina’s ouster at the behest of protesters to lead a caretaker government, will step down after the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus said the vote will “set the standard for good elections”, his office said in a statement on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Hasina struck a defiant tone, attacking her longtime rival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh will never experience free and fair elections until the shadow that Yunus casts is lifted from the people of Bangladesh,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi parties launched their official campaigns on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Australia thrash Sri Lanka, BD make U-19 World Cup Super Six</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968749/australia-thrash-sri-lanka-bd-make-u-19-world-cup-super-six</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;HARARE: Australia maintained their perfect record at the U-19 World Cup 2026 with a crushing nine-wicket victory over Sri Lanka, while Bangladesh booked their place in the Super Six stage with a seven-wicket win over the United States on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their final Group ‘A’ fixture, Australia skittled Sri Lanka for a paltry 58, with William Byrom leading the attack with a five-wicket haul, to finish top of the group with three wins from three matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Bangladesh prevailed in a virtual knockout clash in Harare, where skipper Azizul Hakim Takim struck 64 to guide his side past the USA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sri Lanka never recovered from an early collapse triggered by Australia’s seamers. Charles Lachmund struck twice in his third over to leave Sri Lanka reeling before Byrom ran through the middle order, claiming four wickets as the innings crumbled to 30 for six.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Chamika Heent­igala offered brief resistance with 14, Sri Lanka were eventually dismissed for 58, with Byrom returning to pick up his fifth wicket. Hayden Schi­ller and Kasey Barton supported the effort with tidy spells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s chase was straightforward despite losing Will Malajczuk for four in the opening over. Steven Hogan (28 not out) and Nitesh Samuel (19 not out) then added an unbroken 58-run stand to complete the formalities inside 12 overs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Harare, Bangladesh produced a composed performance to beat the USA by seven wickets in a winner-takes-all contest for a Super Six berth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put in to bat, the USA were rocked early before Sahil Garg (35) and Utkarsh Srivastava (39) steadied the innings with a 51-run stand. Bangladesh struck back through Shahriar Ahmed and Iqbal Hossain, and the USA slipped to 128 for seven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adnit Jhamb, however, staged a fine counterattack, finishing unbeaten on 68 to lift his side to 199, all out off the final ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh began their reply in positive fashion as Zawad Abrar struck 47 in a 78-run opening stand. After the fall of both openers, Azizul Hakim Takim took control of the chase, sharing an 88-run partnership with Kalam Siddiki Aleen (30 not out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Azizul was eventually dismissed for 64 with 24 still required, but Rizan Hossan, who had earlier taken two wickets, struck a brisk 20 to see Bangladesh home with little fuss.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladesh Cricket Board has again written to the ICC seeking arbitration through its independent dispute resolution committee after the world body refused to shift their T20 World Cup matches from India. Citing security concerns, the BCB has maintained it will not travel unless matches are moved to Sri Lanka. The standoff, however, was triggered by Mustafizur Rahman’s removal from the IPL over security issues.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh T20 World Cup row overshadows India’s Olympic ambitions</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968602/bangladesh-t20-world-cup-row-overshadows-indias-olympic-ambitions</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;India hopes next month’s T20 World Cup will bolster its credentials as a global sports host — and the country’s Olympic ambitions — but preparations have been rocked by a diplomatic row with Bangladesh and accusations of political interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With barely two weeks until the tournament, Bangladesh have effectively been forced out after the International Cricket Council (ICC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected &lt;/a&gt;a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;request&lt;/a&gt; to move their matches from India to co-hosts Sri Lanka, citing security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our only demand is to play the World Cup  but not in India,” Bangladesh Cricket Board President Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters on Thursday, adding that without a change of venue, the team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413/bangladesh-firm-on-not-playing-t20-world-cup-in-india&quot;&gt;would not participate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India is preparing to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957607&quot;&gt;host&lt;/a&gt; the 2030 Commonwealth Games in Ahmedabad, seen as a stepping stone to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1930946/india-to-bid-for-commonwealth-games-as-part-of-olympic-push&quot;&gt;2036 Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the chaotic build-up to the T20 World Cup has cast a shadow over those ambitions, especially with cricket returning to the Olympic Games at Los Angeles 2028.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T20 World Cup schedule was delayed and not released until December and now it appears Scotland could have to be drafted to replace Bangladesh just days before the opening match on February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#no-one-to-challenge&quot; id=&quot;no-one-to-challenge&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘No one to challenge’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh is a cricket-loving nation. If a country of nearly 200 million people misses the World Cup, the ICC will lose a huge audience,” Bulbul added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cricket is entering the Olympics in 2028, Brisbane in 2032, India is bidding for 2036. Excluding a major cricket-loving country like Bangladesh would be a failure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC said it had found “no credible or verifiable threat” to move Bangladesh’s games, and was committed to “safeguarding the collective interests of the global game”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that global game is dominated by India, where cricket is woven deep into culture, the economy and politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Asia accounts for about 90 per cent of cricket’s billion-plus fans, with India generating roughly three-quarters of the sport’s global income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s supremacy stems from the outsized revenues of its BCCI cricket board, flush with cash from its role as custodian of the most popular sport in the world’s most populous country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sports journalist Pradeep Magazine wrote in the &lt;em&gt;Tribune&lt;/em&gt;, an Indian daily, that the BCCI’s “staggering revenues… gives it unimaginable control over decision-making in cricketing affairs of the world”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no one to challenge India’s hegemony.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC chairman Jay Shah is the son of Amit Shah, India’s powerful interior minister, and right-hand man of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#a-political-issue&quot; id=&quot;a-political-issue&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘A political issue’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cricket has been captured completely by politics in a way that it never has been before,” Indian sports journalist Sharda Ugra told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bangladesh issue has reached where it has because it’s a political issue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations between India and Bangladesh have soured since a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; Sheikh Hasina, now a convicted fugitive hosted by old ally New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But matters escalated after the India Premier League (IPL) team Kolkata Knight Riders were ordered by India’s BCCI board to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;drop&lt;/a&gt; Bangladeshi fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman, triggering fury in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman’s removal followed online outrage by right-wing Indian Hindus who invoked alleged attacks on a fellow community in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dhaka maintains that Indian media had exaggerated the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim government sports adviser Asif Nazrul said that “no one should have a monopoly” over cricket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the ICC truly wants to be a global organisation, and if the ICC does not rise and sit at India’s command, then we must be given the opportunity to play in the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka,” Nazrul said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh wanted to follow the example of Pakistan, who will play all their matches in Sri Lanka under a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1879734&quot;&gt;deal&lt;/a&gt; hatched after India refused to travel to Islamabad for the 2025 Champions Trophy and all their games were moved in Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is no one in the ICC who can stand up to anything that the BCCI says or does,” said Ugra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BCCI and the ICC are the same thing at the moment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

      <title>Telenor sells its stake in Thailand’s True Corporation for $3.9 billion</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968445/telenor-sells-its-stake-in-thailands-true-corporation-for-39-billion</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Telenor said on Thursday it would sell its 30.3 per cent stake in Thailand’s True Corporation for $3.92 billion, its second divestment from Asia in recent months, lifting the Norwegian group’s shares 8 pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telenor said it had signed an agreement with Arise Digital Technology Company, owned by Khun Suphachai Chearavanont, to sell 24.95 pc in True and then its remaining 5.35 pc stake two years after the closing of the initial deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telenor has been a major investor in Asian telecoms since the 1990s, building operations in Bangladesh, Thailand, Malaysia and Pakistan, but has recently said it is open to deals as the industry matures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#may-also-do-deals-in-malaysia-bangladesh&quot; id=&quot;may-also-do-deals-in-malaysia-bangladesh&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;May also do deals in Malaysia, Bangladesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With the completion of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1797960&quot;&gt;sale of Telenor Pakistan&lt;/a&gt; in December, and the agreement to sell our shares in True we have taken big steps in delivering on that strategy,” Telenor CEO Benedicte Schilbred Fasmer said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telenor’s other Asian companies, Malaysia’s CelcomDigi where it owns 33.1 pc and Grameenphone where it holds a 55.8 pc stake, could also become subject to deals, the group said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s business as usual until such time that any opportunities present themselves,” Chief Financial Officer Torbjorn Wist told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know we’re going to be focusing on delivering value to our remaining assets in Malaysia and Bangladesh. And then over time, we’ll see if we can find structural opportunities for those as well,” Wist said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True is one of Thailand’s biggest telecom operators with around 60 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telenor will book an accounting gain of 14.7b Norwegian crowns at the current exchange rate at the closing of the initial stake sale and said it aimed to provide further information next month on the use of the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divestment, which is expected to close within a few months, is projected to boost Telenor’s return on capital employed and underpins the company’s goal of focusing more of its business in the Nordic region, it said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh parties launch campaigns for first post-Hasina elections</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968417/bangladesh-parties-launch-campaigns-for-first-post-hasina-elections</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh began official campaigning on Thursday for the hugely anticipated general &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1960599&quot;&gt;elections&lt;/a&gt; next month, the first since the 2024 uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ended&lt;/a&gt; the autocratic rule of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;Sheikh Hasina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of flag-waving supporters of key frontrunner &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) crowded the streets of the northern city of Sylhet, chanting his name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have liberated the country from autocratic rule,” prime ministerial hopeful Rahman, who returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile, told crowds of BNP loyalists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Now we must establish the rights of the people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman vowed to create jobs for “millions of unemployed youth” and support women’s economic independence. “Do we have a leader? Yes, we do,” BNP loyalists shouted, carrying placards of Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) supporters gather for a rally ahead of the upcoming national election, in Sylhet on Jan 22, 2026. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/22122529a6e00af.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) supporters gather for a rally ahead of the upcoming national election, in Sylhet on Jan 22, 2026. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key rival Jamaat-i-Islami began its campaign in the capital Dhaka, after being crushed during Hasina’s 15 years in power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat’s leader Shafiqur Rahman said he wanted to clamp down on corruption and build a nation where “people from all races, religions and communities will be treated equally”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the sea of Jamaat supporters was 36-year-old Kakoli Akter, who said it was the first election rally she had ever attended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although eligible to vote since 2008, she said this would be the first time she would cast a ballot, as she could finally support the party of her choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Asian nation votes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1960599&quot;&gt;February 12&lt;/a&gt; to elect 350 lawmakers — polls that will bring in new leadership after prolonged turmoil following the ouster of Hasina’s government, reshaping domestic politics and regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes against the backdrop of insecurity — including the murder last month of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962252&quot;&gt;student leader&lt;/a&gt; of the anti-Hasina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1882265&quot;&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; — as well as warnings of a “flood” of online disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union election observers say the vote will be the “biggest democratic process of 2026”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#progress-of-reform&quot; id=&quot;progress-of-reform&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Progress of reform’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarique Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP following the death of his mother, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;died in December&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Bangladesh&amp;rsquo;s Jamaat-i-Islami leader Shafiqur Rahman waves to his supporters during a rally as he begins campaigning ahead of the upcoming national elections, in Mirpur on Jan 22, 2026. &amp;mdash; AFP&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/22181911f2e10d3.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, home to one of the world’s largest Muslim-majority populations, has a significant Sufi following, and Tarique Zia followed tradition to launch his campaigns in Sylhet, home to the centuries-old shrine of Shah Jalal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He will carry forward the legacy of his parents,” said Harunur Rashid, a 40-year-old die-hard BNP supporter, referring to Zia and her husband, former president Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-i-Islami, which opposes Sufi mystical interpretations, began its campaign in the capital Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-i-Islami is seeking a return to formal politics after years of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1855267&quot;&gt;bans&lt;/a&gt; and crackdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Hasina fled to India, key Jamaat leaders have been released from prison, and groups have grown increasingly assertive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963842/bangladeshs-national-citizen-party-new-hope-that-looks-like-the-old-guard&quot;&gt;National Citizen Party&lt;/a&gt; (NCP), formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising — now allied with Jamaat — launched their campaign with its chief Nahid Islam urging voters to “carry forward the progress of reform”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineer Raqibul Hasan Shawon, 26, watched the BNP rally from the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t decided whom to vote for yet,” he said. “We have heard commitments before, but they were never fulfilled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#new-bangladesh&quot; id=&quot;new-bangladesh&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘New Bangladesh’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;returned from exile&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024 at the behest of protesters to lead a caretaker government as “chief adviser”, will step down after the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus said he inherited a “completely broken” political system, and championed a reform charter he argues is vital to prevent a return to authoritarian rule, with a referendum on the changes to be held on the same day as polling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you cast the ‘yes’ vote, the door to building the new Bangladesh will open,” Yunus said on January 19, in a broadcast to the nation urging support for the referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, he warned he was “concerned about the impact” a surge of disinformation could have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have flooded social media with fake news, rumours and speculation,” Yunus said, blaming both “foreign media and local sources”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations with neighbouring India have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957625&quot;&gt;soured&lt;/a&gt;, after Hasina escaped to her old ally New Delhi as protesters stormed her palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, 78, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power, remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Pakistan is reportedly considering a boycott of the upcoming T20 World Cup 2026 if Bangladesh decides against participating due to its refusal to play matches in India over security concerns.

      <title>Bangladesh firm on not playing T20 World Cup in India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413/bangladesh-firm-on-not-playing-t20-world-cup-in-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will not travel to India to play in next month’s T20 World Cup, its cricket board said on Thursday, effectively ruling the country out of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/bangladesh-firm-on-not-playing-t20-world-cup-in-india-despite-icc-saying-they-will-be-replaced-1520515&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESPN Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the decision was announced after a meeting in Dhaka between Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) President Aminul Islam Bulbul, CEO Nizamuddin, Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul and several national team players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our only demand is to play the World Cup – but not in India,” the BCB president told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) announced that it would not be making any changes to the World Cup schedule or groups, days after Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;requested&lt;/a&gt; that its matches be moved to Sri Lanka after refusing to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will go back to the ICC with our plan to play in Sri Lanka,” the BCB president said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They did give us a 24-hour ultimatum but a global body can’t really do that. ICC will miss out on 200 million people watching the World Cup (if Bangladesh is axed). It will be their loss…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh is a cricket-loving nation. If a country of nearly 200 million people misses the World Cup, the ICC will lose a huge audience,” the BCB’s Bulbul said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Cricket is entering the Olympics in 2028, Brisbane in 2032, India is bidding for 2036. Excluding a major cricket-loving country like Bangladesh would be a failure,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Nazrul said, “There is no scope for changing our decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Bangladesh’s security concerns “did not arise from speculation or theoretical analysis”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They arose from a real incident – where one of our country’s top players was forced to bow to extremists, and the Indian cricket board asked him to leave India,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are hopeful that ICC will give us the opportunity to play in Sri Lanka,” Nazrul said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following yesterday’s decision by the ICC, Islam had said Bangladesh players were keen to play in the World Cup and that he was “hoping for a miracle from the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Who doesn’t want to play in the World Cup?” Islam said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh players want to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh government wants Bangladesh to play the World Cup. But we don’t think India is safe for our players,” Islam had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries.

&lt;p&gt;“Do we have a leader? Yes, we do,” BNP loyalists shouted, carrying placards of the prime ministerial hopeful Rahman, who only returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami will begin its campaign in the capital Dhaka later in the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Asian nation of 170 million votes on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1960599&quot;&gt;February 12&lt;/a&gt; to elect 350 lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The polls are expected to usher in new leadership after prolonged turmoil following the ouster of Hasina’s government, reshaping domestic politics and regional dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes against the backdrop of insecurity — including the murder last month of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962252&quot;&gt;student leader&lt;/a&gt; of the anti-Hasina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1882265&quot;&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt; — as well as warnings of a “flood” of online disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Union election observers say the vote will be the “biggest democratic process of 2026”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#never-fulfilled&quot; id=&quot;never-fulfilled&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Never fulfilled’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, 60, better known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, assumed leadership of the BNP following the death of his mother, former prime minister Khaleda Zia, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;died in December&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He will carry forward the legacy of his parents,” said Harun Ur Rashid, a 40-year-old die-hard BNP supporter, referring to Zia and her husband, former president Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, home to one of the world’s largest Muslim-majority populations, has a significant Sufi following, and parties have traditionally launched campaigns in Sylhet, home to the centuries-old shrine of Shah Jalal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters lined the streets on Wednesday night as Rahman prayed at the shrine, cheering as his election bus passed by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-i-Islami, which opposes Sufi mystical interpretations, begins its campaign in the capital Dhaka, in the constituency of its leader Shafiqur Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood, Jamaat-i-Islami is seeking a return to formal politics after years of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1855267&quot;&gt;bans&lt;/a&gt; and crackdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Hasina fled to India, key Jamaat leaders have been released from prison, and groups have grown increasingly assertive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963842/bangladeshs-national-citizen-party-new-hope-that-looks-like-the-old-guard&quot;&gt;National Citizen Party&lt;/a&gt; (NCP), formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising, and who have formed an alliance with Jamaat, will also launch their rally in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineer Raqibul Hasan Shawon, 26, watched the BNP rally from the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I haven’t decided whom to vote for yet,” he said. “We have heard commitments before, but they were never fulfilled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#new-bangladesh&quot; id=&quot;new-bangladesh&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘New Bangladesh’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize laureate, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;returned from exile&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024 at the behest of protesters to lead a caretaker government as “chief adviser”, will step down after the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus said he inherited a “completely broken” political system, and championed a reform charter he argues is vital to prevent a return to authoritarian rule, with a referendum on the changes to be held on the same day as polling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you cast the ‘yes’ vote, the door to building the new Bangladesh will open,” Yunus said on January 19, in a broadcast to the nation urging support for the referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, he warned he was “concerned about the impact” a surge of disinformation could have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They have flooded social media with fake news, rumours and speculation,” Yunus said, blaming both “foreign media and local sources”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations with neighbouring India have &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1957625&quot;&gt;soured&lt;/a&gt;, after Hasina escaped to her old ally New Delhi as protesters stormed her palace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, 78, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; in absentia in November for crimes against humanity for the deadly crackdown on protesters in her failed bid to cling to power, remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh seek ‘miracle’ to secure T20 World Cup participation</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968413/bangladesh-seek-miracle-to-secure-t20-world-cup-participation</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) will speak to the country’s interim government in a last-ditch attempt to secure the team’s participation in next month’s Twenty20 World Cup after their demand to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;shift their matches&lt;/a&gt; outside India was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india&quot;&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) board has dismissed Bangladesh’s concerns about the safety and security of their players and fans in India, citing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968211&quot;&gt;political tension&lt;/a&gt; between the South Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With their demands to play their matches in Sri Lanka shot down by the game’s global governing body, Bangladesh find themselves left with the difficult options of either withdrawing their demand or getting replaced by another team in the global showpiece that begins on February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I asked the ICC board for time to talk to my government for one last time,” BCB president Aminul Islam told reporters after learning of the ICC decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They said it’s a valid point and gave me 24 or 48 hours to get back to them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We know that India is not secure for us. We remain in the stance that we want to play in Sri Lanka. I know the ICC denied us, but we will talk to the government one more time. I will inform the ICC about the government’s feedback.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aware of a potential backlash that would follow any volte-face about playing in India, Aminul said the players were keen to play in the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am hoping for a miracle from the ICC. Who doesn’t want to play in the World Cup?” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh players want to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh government wants Bangladesh to play the World Cup. But we don’t think India is safe for our players.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations have soured between the neighbours in recent times and cricket has been affected too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; from this year’s Indian Premier League (IPL) despite him signing with its Kolkata franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh responded by banning IPL broadcasts in the country and demanding to play their World Cup matches in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Pakistan expressed disappointment as the International Cricket Council rejected Bangladesh&apos;s request to move T20 World Cup matches from India, despite Pakistan backing Bangladesh&apos;s stance in principle. However, Pakistan has clarified that withdrawing from the tournament is not an option, as they are already scheduled to play at a neutral venue.</description>

      <title>ICC rejects Bangladesh’s plea to play T20 World Cup matches outside India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968235/icc-rejects-bangladeshs-plea-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-outside-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) on Wednesday announced that it would not be making any changes to the Men’s T20 World Cup schedule or groups, days after Bangladesh requested that its matches be moved to Sri Lanka after refusing to play in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T20 World Cup begins on February 7 with Bangladesh in England’s Group C. The team is scheduled to play all of their group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/tournaments/mens-t20-world-cup-2026/news/icc-upholds-current-match-schedule-for-men-s-t20-world-cup-2026&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement &lt;/a&gt;issued on Wednesday, the ICC said the decision was reached after “considering all security assessments conducted, including independent reviews, all of which indicated there was no threat to Bangladesh players, media persons, officials and fans at any tournament venues in the country”.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ICC/status/2013958324618920299?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was noted that it was not feasible to make changes so close to the tournament and that altering the schedule under the circumstances, in the absence of any credible security threat, could set a precedent that would jeopardise the sanctity of future ICC events and undermine its neutrality as a global governing body,” the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, an ICC spokesperson said that the governing body had engaged the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) for the past few weeks with the “clear objective of enabling Bangladesh’s participation in the tournament”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But that despite these efforts, the BCB repeatedly linked its participation “to a single, isolated and unrelated development concerning one of its player’s involvement in a domestic league”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This linkage has no bearing on the tournament’s security framework or the conditions governing participation in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup,” it said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, &lt;em&gt;Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/icc-to-replace-bangladesh-at-t20-world-cup-if-they-don-t-travel-to-india-1520371&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the ICC had given the BCB one more day to confer with the Bangladesh government about whether its team would travel to India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should they continue to refuse, the ICC Board will replace Bangladesh with Scotland in the tournament, based on team rankings, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Late on Tuesday night, the Bangladesh government’s sports adviser Asif Nazrul had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968106/cannot-be-pressurised-to-play-in-india-says-bangladesh-sports-adviser&quot;&gt;reiterated &lt;/a&gt;that under no condition would the national team travel to India for the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the ICC bows to pressure from the Indian cricket board and tries to impose pressure on us by setting unreasonable conditions, we will not accept those conditions,” Nazrul had told reporters, according to the &lt;em&gt;Press Trust of India&lt;/em&gt; (PTI) news agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past, there are examples that Pakistan said that they will not travel to India and ICC changed the venue. We have asked to change the venue on logical ground and we cannot be pressurised to play in India by putting illogical pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Is Revolutionary Politics Replacing Constitutional Rule In Bangladesh?</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/revolutionary-politics-replacing-constitutional-rule-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The strategic consequences extend well beyond Dhaka. Bangladesh occupies a critical position in the Bay of Bengal, bordering major sea lanes and neighboring one of the world’s most volatile regions. A Bangladesh drifting toward extra-constitutional governance while deepening ties with China and Pakistan would alter regional dynamics in ways that merit serious attention in Washington and European capitals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Cannot be pressurised to play in India, says Bangladesh sports adviser</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968106/cannot-be-pressurised-to-play-in-india-says-bangladesh-sports-adviser</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh government’s sports adviser Asif Nazrul on Tuesday reiterated that under no condition would the national team travel to India for the T20 World Cup, despite an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967846&quot;&gt;ultimatum&lt;/a&gt; from the International Cricket Council (ICC) to the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on deciding its participation by January 21, the &lt;em&gt;Press Trust of India&lt;/em&gt; (PTI) news agency reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If BCB remains adamant on not travelling to India for the 20-team tournament, Scotland is likely to replace Bangladesh as per current rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am not aware that Scotland will be included in our place,” Asif told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the ICC bows to pressure from the Indian cricket board and tries to impose pressure on us by setting unreasonable conditions, we will not accept those conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past, there are examples that Pakistan said that they will not travel to India and ICC changed the venue. We have asked to change the venue on logical ground and we cannot be pressurised to play in India by putting illogical pressure.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The standoff was triggered by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;removal &lt;/a&gt;of Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman from Kolkata Knight Riders’ roster for this year’s Indian Premier League on Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) instructions for unspecified “developments all around”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citing security concerns and national pride, the BCB responded by announcing its national team &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;won’t travel to India&lt;/a&gt; for its group stage games in Kolkata and Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCB wants to play each of its four group-stage matches in Sri Lanka, where the marquee India-Pakistan clash will also be held as per the mutually agreed arrangement for ICC events until 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh is currently placed in Group ‘C’ along with the West Indies, Italy, England and Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its last meeting with ICC officials in Dhaka, the BCB had proposed swapping positions with Ireland in Group ‘B’, which features tournament co-hosts Sri Lanka, Australia, Oman and Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a move would allow Bangladesh to remain in Sri Lanka for entirety of its group-stage engagements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the BCB considers it unsafe for its players to travel to India, the ICC’s risk assessment report did not flag any specific or direct threat to the team’s participation in the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bilateral relations between India and Bangladesh have deteriorated in recent months, exacerbated by the reported killings of Hindus in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former Bangladesh captain Tamim Iqbal and current Test skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto have cautioned against a very hard-line approach on the controversial subject, with the former saying that decisions taken today would have repercussions 10 years down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>India to withdraw diplomats’ families from Bangladesh, source says</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1968211/india-to-withdraw-diplomats-families-from-bangladesh-source-says</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;India will withdraw its diplomats’ families and dependents from Bangladesh in the face of security threats as tension rises ahead of a February 12 general &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1960599&quot;&gt;election&lt;/a&gt;, an Indian official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Campaigning begins on Thursday for Bangladesh’s election, which has sparked protests and counter-protests. Ties between the South Asian neighbours soured after former prime minister Sheikh Hasina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;fled&lt;/a&gt; to India in 2024, following deadly protests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s past support for Hasina has frayed relations between the two neighbours since her overthrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s withdrawal move was part of “internal readjustments”, the official said, without elaborating. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, pointed to Indian media reports of New Delhi’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was not immediately clear when the families would return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreign ministries of India and Bangladesh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, India &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961779&quot;&gt;summoned&lt;/a&gt; Bangladesh’s high commissioner, or ambassador to voice its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962623&quot;&gt;concern&lt;/a&gt; over what it called a deteriorating security situation there, particularly threats targeting the Indian mission in the capital, Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s ex-premier Hasina was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to death in November after a months-long trial that found her guilty of ordering a deadly crackdown on the student-led uprising in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has repeatedly &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1956992&quot;&gt;sought&lt;/a&gt; Hasina’s extradition to Bangladesh, while rejecting New Delhi’s concerns over violence targeting members of the minority Hindu community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, a popular student leader of Bangladesh’s 2024 uprising, Sharif Osman Hadi, was wounded in an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961387&quot;&gt;assassination attempt&lt;/a&gt; last month and died after being flown to Singapore for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi was a senior leader of the student protest group Inqilab Mancha and an outspoken critic of India. His death set off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962210&quot;&gt;violent protests &lt;/a&gt;with angry mobs torching several buildings, including two major newspapers deemed to favour India, as well as a prominent cultural institution.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>T20 WC: &apos;No sense&apos; - Pakistan questioned for halting prep in support of B&apos;desh</title>

      <description>Reports claiming Pakistan has halted T20 World Cup 2026 preparations in support of Bangladesh have been dismissed by former cricketers. Kamran Akmal called the idea illogical, stressing no official PCB or government statement exists. Basit Ali said any decision depends on the government and noted broadcasters would oppose withdrawal, especially due to the India–Pakistan match. The issue stems from Bangladesh’s refusal to play in India over security concerns.</description>

				&lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;WINDHOEK: Australian opener Will Malajczuk plays a shot during the U-19 World Cup match against Japan at the High Performance Oval on Tuesday.—Courtesy ICC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HARARE: Australia recorded a comfortable win against Japan in their second match of the U-19 World Cup to book a place in the Super 6s on Tuesday. Meanwhile, points were shared again in Bulawayo after the game between New Zealand and Bangladesh was abandoned due to rain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan opted to bat first after winning the toss and despite losing Nikhil Pol early, were able to set a platform to post a competitive score on the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nihar Parmar and Hugo Tani-Kelly built a solid 58-run partnership that was ended by a smart piece of Australian fielding as Parmar was run out on 33. But Tani-Kelly, the centurion in the last game, was in fine form and continued to aid the Japanese cause.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was supported well by Charles Hinze after the departure of Parmar, adding 24 runs off 22 balls. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, after his dismissal, Tani-Kelly kept running out of partners until Montgomery Hinze, whose 29 off 51 allowed Tani-Kelly to take Japan’s score past the 200-run mark&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tani-Kelly was the pillar of the Japanese innings as he remained unbeaten on 79, setting the defending champions a target of 202.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia’s opening pair sniffed out any chance of a threat in the second innings with a power-packed opening partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will Malajczuk and Nitesh Samuel posted a 135-run stand in just 15 overs to put Australia on course for the win. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malajczuk scored a 51-ball hundred to record the fastest-ever century in U-19 World Cup history. His knock of 102 in 55 deliveries gave Australia enough momentum for them cruise to a win.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samuel remained unbeaten on 60 as Australia eased to an eight-wicket win to book their place in the Super 6s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australia next face Sri Lanka, who also have a perfect record in the tournament so far on Friday while Japan take on Ireland on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Zealand and Bangladesh had to settle for a share of the spoils after rain only allowed 10 overs of play on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh had asked New Zealand to bat first after winning the toss and the Kiwis had got off to a good start thanks to Aryandeep Mann and captain Thomas Jones, who came in after the loss of Hugo Bogue’s wicket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the heavens opened at the end of the 10th over, allowing no further play as the game was called off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is New Zealand’s second straight game that has been abandoned due to rain. They next face India on Saturday, while Bangladesh take on USA a day earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

The UK clings to neoliberal ideas while households pay the price&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/18d75e20-b63e-4f47-8f63-58c0cc4bca22&quot;&gt;Food policy&lt;/a&gt; across much of the world is changing. But not in Britain. That may be a costly mistake as the prices of essentials rise because of the climate emergency, geopolitical tensions and the fragility of just-in-time supply chains. Many capitals are now reviving their strategic food reserves. European nations such as Sweden, Finland, Norway and Germany are rebuilding stocks dismantled after the cold war. Climate shocks have led to Egypt and Bangladesh boosting similar programmes. Countries such as Brazil and Indonesia – sensitive to the food needs of their vast populations – are also expanding their reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UK, by contrast, has no substantial public food reserves. Its strategy rests almost entirely on global markets and private intentions – an approach shaped by decades of liberalised trade. Even in the event of war, the official advice focuses on households &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/uk-households-told-stockpile-one-36048517&quot;&gt;stockpiling&lt;/a&gt; essentials. In Britain’s view, food security is&amp;nbsp;about prices, not scarcity of supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

      <description>Bangladesh’s student leaders, one of the main driving forces behind the mass protests that brought down former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024, now face an uncertain political future.
Despite their central role in the uprising, the youth movement has been granted only a small share of parliamentary seats under a new electoral alliance led by Jamaat-e-Islami – an Islamist party that was long politically marginalised but has re-emerged as a central player.
Under the agreement, the student-led...</description>

      <title>JazzWorld locks Rs75bn swap deal with UBL</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967972/jazzworld-locks-rs75bn-swap-deal-with-ubl</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;KARACHI: JazzWorld, an integrated digital services company, has executed Pakistan’s largest-ever interest rate swap (IRS) transaction of Rs75 billion with United Bank Ltd (UBL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interest rate swap is a financial contract under which two parties exchange interest payment obligations, typically swapping a fixed interest rate for a floating rate for a predetermined amount over a specified period. Such instruments allow borrowers to better manage interest rate risk or secure more favourable financing terms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jazz’s Chief Financial Officer Farrukh Khan said that in Pakistan, most corporate loans are on variable rates, which adjust every three to six months. “For our growth, we borrow long term, but until now, we had no certainty over future interest costs,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, most corporate loans are extended on a variable-rate basis, with interest rates rising or falling every three to six months, depending on the facility. For growth, Jazz typically borrows long-term, often for up to 10 years, but without certainty over whether future interest costs will be higher or lower, which creates significant uncertainty, particularly in the local volatile operating environment, he explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IRS covers about Rs35bn for five years and the balance for seven years, representing roughly 28-29 per cent of Jazz’s total debt. “While the majority of our debt remains variable, this transaction reduces uncertainty in financing costs and cash flows, allowing us to focus on revenue growth and business development,” Mr Khan added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jazz is among the largest borrowers in the country, Mr Khan said, adding that with upcoming spectrum auctions on the horizon, the company expects its borrowing requirements to increase further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to a note by Arif Habib Limited (AHL), the benchmark Karachi Interbank Offered Rate (Kibor) on the prevailing floating-rate loan was last reset in November 2025, with the total borrowing cost estimated at 11.5-12.0pc, based on the six-month Kibor plus 60 basis points. By fixing the rate through the swap, Jazz secures greater cost predictability and insulates itself against the risk of future interest rate increases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Praising Pakistan’s progress in its digital and financial systems, Borak Ozer, Chief Financial Officer of Jazz’s parent company Veon, said it would like to replicate its success in other countries. “From a revenue perspective, Pakistan is our flagship entity, and we would like to copy-paste the model here to Bangladesh,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Pakistan has halted preparations for the T20 World Cup 2026, backing Bangladesh&apos;s refusal to play in India due to security concerns. Islamabad has indicated it may withdraw if the issue isn&apos;t resolved, following Bangladesh&apos;s withdrawal from the IPL. The ICC is reluctant to shift Bangladesh&apos;s matches, potentially leading to Scotland&apos;s replacement.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh face deadline over refusal to play T20 World Cup matches in India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967846/bangladesh-face-deadline-over-refusal-to-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The International Cricket Council (ICC) has told Bangladesh to agree to play their matches at next month’s T20 World Cup in India or risk being kicked out of the tournament, reports said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T20 World Cup begins on February 7 with Bangladesh in England’s Group C and scheduled to play all of their group matches in Kolkata and Mumbai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1967503&quot;&gt;held talks&lt;/a&gt; in Dhaka at the weekend with ICC officials over the impasse, but no agreement was reached.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the discussions, the BCB reiterated its formal request to the ICC to relocate Bangladesh’s matches to Sri Lanka,” a BCB statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC have not officially commented, but website &lt;em&gt;Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt; and other Indian media reported on Monday that the deadline of Wednesday had been set for Dhaka to make a decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ICC sources have told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; that Bangladesh could be replaced by Scotland, who are the highest-ranked team who did not qualify for the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One suggestion was for Bangladesh to swap with Group B’s Ireland, whose matches are in Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Among other points, the possibility of moving Bangladesh to a different group as a means of facilitating the matter with minimum logistical adjustments was discussed,” said the BCB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will play all their matches in Colombo under an ICC agreement with India to play at neutral venues in global or regional tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The row erupted on January 3, when the IPL’s Kolkata Knight Riders were ordered by India’s cricket board to drop Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman, sparking fury in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations between India and Bangladesh soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pakistan’s exchange rate illusion</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967697/pakistans-exchange-rate-illusion</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The exchange rate is a critical economic variable for Pakistan. A competitive and credible currency regime should form the core of the nation’s economic strategy, particularly given the country’s dependence on foreign exchange for growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Pakistan has repeatedly used the exchange rate as a short-term stabilisation tool, often holding it at levels that favour political convenience rather than economic fundamentals. Once reserves are depleted, this approach has led to abrupt and disruptive corrections consistently undermining rather than enhancing export potential.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it is incredibly important to have a competitive exchange rate as it improves export margins, encourages investment in tradable goods, and signals the viability of producing for global markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History shows that prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax on exports and a subsidy to imports&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, rate alone is insufficient; credibility is equally essential. Exporters are willing to invest and scale up operations only if they trust that relative prices will remain broadly aligned with fundamentals over time. In Pakistan’s case, this trust has been repeatedly eroded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Musharraf era&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the Musharraf administration, the rupee was kept stable at around Rs60 to the dollar throughout much of the 2000s. While this stability created an illusion of macroeconomic soundness, it concealed growing external imbalances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the pressures finally surfaced, the adjustment was late and severe: from 2007 to 2009, the rupee dropped from roughly Rs60 to over Rs80 per dollar as reserves collapsed and an International Monetary Fund intervention became necessary. Exporters, who had operated under an overvalued currency, did not suddenly become competitive. Instead, they faced higher input costs, disrupted financing, and weakened financial positions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stability over fundamentals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above pattern recurred between 2013 and 2017, with the rupee held between Rs100–105 per dollar despite widening current-account deficits and falling reserves. Exporters consistently warned about the currency’s overvaluation, but policy makers focused on maintaining price stability and political optics. When the inevitable adjustment occurred, it was abrupt and disorderly: the rupee’s value dropped sharply in mid-2017, followed by a larger correction after 2018, reaching around Rs160 per dollar by mid-2019. This sudden realignment destabilised firms and inflation expectations instead of supporting a smooth transition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market distortions and eroding confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last three years have proven even more damaging. Administrative controls, delayed adjustments, and the emergence of multiple exchange rates pushed pressure into informal markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2023, the rupee experienced one of its steepest single-day falls, losing nearly 10 per cent within hours. Over the year, it depreciated by close to 30pc percent, at one point briefly approaching Rs300 per dollar before settling near Rs285 when administrative controls were introduced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These shifts coincided with harsh stabilisation measures such as import compression, punitive interest rates, higher energy prices, and increased taxes. Any potential export gains from depreciation were negated by rising costs and collapsing confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Repeatedly underminig exports&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These episodes highlight a clear lesson: prolonged artificial stability acts as a tax on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964797&quot;&gt;exports&lt;/a&gt; and a subsidy to imports. This encourages consumption and rent-seeking while discouraging investment in tradable sectors. When adjustment is finally forced, it comes as a crisis — too sudden and volatile to generate the intended export response. Exporters cannot recover lost markets overnight, nor can they invest amidst uncertainty and tightening financial conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gradual adjustment and integrated policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Successful export economies do not rely on dramatic devaluations. Instead, they allow gradual, market-aligned adjustments, avoid prolonged misalignments, and resist using the exchange rate as a political tool. Effective currency policy is complemented by competitive energy pricing, predictable taxation, efficient logistics, and skills development, enabling exporters to respond to price signals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, Vietnam has pursued gradual adjustments that avoid prolonged overvaluation and limit volatility, giving exporters the confidence to invest and integrate into global value chains. Bangladesh has similarly adopted a steady crawl rather than crisis-driven devaluations, preserving export competitiveness and market share — a model Pakistan has repeatedly failed to emulate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: toward a credible exchange rate policy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s core issue is not deciding between a ‘strong’ or ‘weak’ rupee. Rather, it is the persistent belief that administrative controls can substitute for competitiveness. Until the exchange-rate policy reflects fundamentals on a sustained basis and is part of a broader, credible export strategy, depreciation will remain disruptive, and exports will continue to be vulnerable to future crises.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Finance : A hard time for employment</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967694/finance-a-hard-time-for-employment</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Major international institutions project Pakistan’s GDP growth for the current fiscal year within a close range of three per cent to 3.6pc. However, this variation primarily reflects the timing of their assessments in relation to the 2025 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1940947&quot;&gt;monsoon floods&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) forecast of 3.6pc was formulated in October 2025 and does not incorporate the impact of the subsequent floods. In contrast, the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) revised estimate of around 3.25pc and the World Bank’s projection of 3pc are later evaluations that explicitly account for the flood’s dampening effect on the economy, particularly the agricultural sector.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Macroeconomic indicators for the first half of the year (July-December 2025) indicate that full-year growth would be somewhere between 3pc and 3.5pc in the best-case scenario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though this exceeds Pakistan’s population growth of roughly 2.6pc, it still risks constraining recent gains in per-capita income and employment creation. Poverty reduction and improved social mobility, and meaningful job creation may remain elusive even as macroeconomic indicators show short-term stabilisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Swift, broad-based employment creation is imperative for national stability and resilience in the increasingly competitive regional and global arena&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much will also depend on the regional and domestic security environment, which remains fluid and difficult to forecast. Heightened tensions in the Middle East — particularly the risk of a limited or escalatory military confrontation involving the United States and Iran — could have indirect but significant repercussions for Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such a scenario may disrupt global energy markets, raise oil prices, strain Pakistan’s import bill, and complicate external financing conditions at a time of fragile macroeconomic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963692&quot;&gt;Diplomatic&lt;/a&gt; pressures could also intensify, placing Pakistan in a delicate position as it seeks to balance strategic neutrality with economic and security interests, including the safety and operational continuity of its diplomatic missions in the region. Even without a full-scale conflict, prolonged uncertainty alone could dampen investor confidence, delay capital inflows, and further weaken prospects for job creation and sustained growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising domestic political polarisation is fraying social cohesion, and failure to create employment could intensify unrest. Pakistan simultaneously faces militancy, terrorism, and a volatile regional security environment, particularly as tensions escalate in the Middle East following the US-Iran imbroglio. In such circumstances, a stagnant labour market is not just an economic problem; it is a strategic vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The picture for 2026 is clear. Moderate GDP growth alone will not generate jobs. Automation, structural inefficiencies, informalisation, skill gaps, and demand suppression converge to constrain employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without bold policy interventions — including labour-intensive investment, workforce skill development, small and medium enterprise (SME) support, and education reform — Pakistan risks growth that is largely jobless, leaving both its workforce and national stability exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Labour-intensive sectors — historically engines of employment like construction, textiles, and agriculture — are no longer absorbing workers as they once did. Automation, mechanisation, and artificial intelligence adoption threaten jobs across industries, particularly in routine roles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research from the Lahore University of Management Sciences Mahbub-ul-Haq Research Centre estimates that around 17 per cent of Pakistan’s workforce is at high risk of displacement due to technological adoption, with manufacturing, customer service, and portions of agriculture most exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s ready-made garment sector demonstrates the consequences of this “jobless growth” dynamic: automation has reportedly reduced workforce numbers by 30pc or more in some factories, even as output and exports surged, leaving lower-skilled workers displaced and incomes stagnant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMEs, long &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1941128&quot;&gt;recognised&lt;/a&gt; as the backbone of Pakistan’s economy and employment, are under intense pressure. According to a joint Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority and International Labour Organisation study, Pakistan’s roughly 5.24 million SMEs account for a substantial portion of economic activity, yet many struggle to survive amid high compliance costs, limited access to formal finance, and regulatory burdens.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Estimates place the informal economy at 35–40pc of GDP, or approximately $457 billion, underscoring its critical role in sustaining livelihoods. Yet as documentation and regulatory demands rise, many small enterprises either shut down or operate outside the formal system, contributing to a “gigified” labour market of precarious, short-term, and underpaid work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The public sector, a fallback for labour absorption in the good old days, too, cannot act as an employer of last resort. The FY25 federal budget froze hiring for BPS 1–16 positions, projected to save Rs45 billion annually, while rightsizing initiatives have eliminated thousands of redundant posts across ministries and attached departments and the ongoing privatisation of overstaffed and financially unviable state-owned enterprises, like the Utility Stores Corporation, also produces a new wave of joblessness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fiscal pressures and international reform conditionalities limit the government’s capacity to offset private-sector job shortfalls. This structural shift leaves the private sector, SMEs, and informal enterprises to shoulder the responsibility of employment creation, a burden made heavier by technological disruption and weak consumer demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even export growth, traditionally a key engine of employment in labour-intensive economies, is becoming less job-intensive. Pakistan’s textile and clothing sector (which accounts for 55–63pc of merchandise exports and roughly $16–18 billion in value) has shown modest growth in recent years. Yet employment in the sector has stagnated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh elections cannot be free and fair in absence of Awami League: Former Foreign minister</title>

      <description>Bangladesh&apos;s oldest party, Awami League, says that upcoming elections on February 12 will lack fairness. Leaders allege the Yunus regime banned them undemocratically. They accuse the UN Human Rights body of a biased report on past unrest. The party is documenting recent killings, including of Hindus, for international bodies.</description>

      <title>HISTORY: THE FORGOTTEN MASSACRE OF MULTAN</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967653/history-the-forgotten-massacre-of-multan</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media  sm:w-9/10  w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Illustration by Sarah Durrani&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/696c54dac8656.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 2, 1978, Gen Ziaul Haq’s regime ordered security forces to open fire at workers striking at Colony Textile Mills, Multan, allegedly killing 133 people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No first information report (FIR) was registered, no civilian trial was held and, aside from a military inquiry whose contents were never shared, a public acknowledgement of this state atrocity has never been made. Instead, what remains is a carefully managed absence from Pakistani history books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tragedy that occurred that cold winter afternoon in Multan was a direct response to industrial workers who had emerged as a major political force in 1970s Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the success of the 1969 students’ and workers’ movement that led to the overthrow of Gen Ayub Khan, leftist politics had strengthened demands for more equitable wealth distribution. During the Ayub dictatorship, state loans given to a small circle of elite industrialists had propped up development statistics but, as wealth disparity dramatically increased, Pakistan’s working class was pushed to economic desperation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In January 1978, Gen Zia’s martial law regime mercilessly mowed down striking textile mill workers in the ‘City of Saints.’ Till today, the scale of the killings is disputed and no official account exists of what is widely considered the bloodiest massacre in Pakistan’s labour history…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ayub’s removal and the civil war in East Pakistan, which led to the creation of Bangladesh, forced President Zulfikar Ali Bhutto to develop legislation for workers’ rights. In February 1972, his martial law government announced new labour laws for Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military, industrialists and even the politicians who had taken their votes were all alarmed at the strength of consolidated worker power. Bhutto’s labour laws, though flawed, dramatically increased the number of labour unions registered in the country and led to regular strike actions by worker groups over fair pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the new labour reforms only existed on paper. Mere months after they came into effect, on June 7, 1972, police killed at least three workers who were protesting against delayed wages by the owners of Feroz Sultan Textile Mills at SITE, Karachi. During one of the funeral processions, police opened fire again, leading to more deaths. Bhutto showed no sympathy, saying the strikers were being manipulated by anti-Pakistan elements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Zia took over the country, his martial law framed labour unrest as a threat to public order. This was the most violent act by the state against labourers in Pakistani history — a systematic erasure that reveals the nexus of state-capital power under martial law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elite Capture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;media  sm:w-7/8  w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;

				&lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Commemorative slab at a graveyard in Frontier Colony in Karachi for labourers killed following protests in June 1972&lt;/figcaption&gt;
			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Understanding the massacre requires understanding who owned the mill — and their proximity to power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Colony Group, owners of Multan Colony Textile Mills, exemplified the industrial elite that had prospered under the Ayub regime. With its business primarily in textile manufacturing, this Chinioti/ Sheikh family group had been well-established before Partition and gained considerable strength due to limited competition in the nascent state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1961, the Colony Group was a part of the big five industrial houses, who each held over Rs50 million — a vast fortune by 1961 standards and equivalent to approximately Rs10 billion today, adjusted for an average annual inflation rate of 8.6 percent — in assets. As with the other industrial groups, it benefitted from the establishment of the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) in 1952.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naseer A. Sheikh, the eldest son of the group’s founder Mohammad Ismaeel, served on PIDC’s Board of Directors. Even after the conglomerate split into two, the Colony Naseer Group, which oversaw the mills, was the seventh richest company in Pakistan in 1970, according to economist Rashid Amjad, former vice chancellor of the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after Bhutto started nationalisation in 1972, the Colony Naseer Group — despite losing Rs93.9 million or 49.5 percent of its assets — was the sixth richest industrial house in Pakistan. When the tragedy happened in 1978, 13,000 workers were employed at Colony Textile Mills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Media Coverage and the State Story&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reporting on the events of January 2, 1978, was carefully managed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The government-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) had been given a handout, and Dawn’s front page on January 3 carried the small headline “Five killed in Multan firing.” International papers reported similar figures, with The New York Times using a United Press International (UPI) wire, stating: “Five Killed and 10 Hurt As Pakistan Police Open Fire at Strikers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The French publication Le Monde and British daily The Guardian carried the same number. The Times of India, however, reported on January 4 that “at least a dozen people were shot dead… The death toll may be 50.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, the APP report framed workers as unreasonable from its opening line, claiming they “refused to accept” a mutually agreed bonus and “proceeded on illegal strike” from December 29, 1977. The APP report of the incident stated that workers had demanded a bonus of four-and-a-half-months’ pay, which the Colony Group management refused, saying as it was “not commensurate with the margin of profit.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The APP report continued that, on January 2, 1978, the labourers on strike became “unruly and rowdy and thousands of them encircled the police force and started brick-batting, resulting in injuries to eight of the policemen, including one ASI [assistant sub-inspector] and one head constable.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The report concluded that the police had to react in self-defence against a crowd that could not be managed and had turned violent. “The police was ordered to lathi-charge [baton-charge], which they did, and teargas was also used to disperse the unruly mob.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inquiry and Discipline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				&lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Memorial for slain labourers, with their graves painted red at Frontier Colony, Karachi | Photos courtesy Piler&lt;/figcaption&gt;
			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the following days, swift administrative action was reported. The mill management announced compensation for the deceased and, within two days of the massacre, the martial law administrator (MLA) for Punjab suspended Multan’s senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chaudhry Niamatullah, assistant commissioner (AC) Jam Jan Mohammad, and the area’s station house officer (SHO), Raja Khizar Hayat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A three-member inquiry committee was also established, with Brig S.M. Ilyas, Col Naeem and Magistrate Sardar Alam, who were going to record “in camera” witness statements. A statement was also taken from Mughis Sheikh, Naseer’s younger brother, who managed the mill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 6, 1978, an “official clarification” was issued, in which the commissioner of Multan Division verified that those killed at Colony Textile Mills “are not more than 14.” This clarification also stated that the number of dead included those whose families had taken them to their villages, instead of the city hospital, “which resulted in their ultimate deaths, as they could not get proper medical aid” — a claim that appeared to shift blame from the shooting to delayed medical care.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it reported that the administration claimed it did not bury any bodies, with all of them handed over to their families — a claim later contradicted by witness testimonies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even Dawn, in a restrained editorial titled ‘A tragedy in Multan’, could only express that, “It is extremely sad that this major clash should have taken place in the days of a Martial Law regime dedicated to the revival of democratic rule and social harmony.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Merely 13 days after the massacre, on January 15, martial law (ML) authorities ordered workers to return — framing it as an ‘appeal’. Maj Gen Ejaz Azim, Multan’s deputy MLA, along with other officials, visited the factory and claimed that 92 percent of workers were present and the mills were functioning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With attention having rapidly shifted to restoring production, workers were promised a bonus equivalent to three months of basic pay on February 1 and recreation allowance on May 1. However, workers were denied pay for the days they were on strike, from December 29 to January 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ML administrators were now regularly visiting the factory and, on January 21, Maj Gen Azim addressed workers that Gen Zia himself had expressed “heartfelt sympathies” and gave “assurance that justice will be done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BEYOND THE OFFICIAL ACCOUNT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet what the martial law administration allowed in reporting differed drastically from what those on the ground — and researchers documenting Gen Zia-era abuses — have recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gen Zia was close to the Sheikh family, having served as Corps Commander Multan right before his appointment as chief of army staff. He had arrived in Multan on January 2 to attend the wedding of Mughis Sheikh’s daughter. Workers reported hearing that the bride’s dowry was 10 times the amount of the bonuses they had demanded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to Hassan Gardezi and Jamil Rashid in Pakistan: The Roots of Dictatorship, workers had occupied the factory floor since December 29, when the strike started, preventing a lockout by the mill management. Aslam Khwaja in People’s Movement in Pakistan writes that, during the afternoon shift-change on the day of the tragedy on January 2, when workers gathered at the gate for a union meeting, police asked them to end the “illegal” strike.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, during the wedding, Gen Zia was allegedly told that workers — having heard of his presence — had gathered in their thousands and were marching towards the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What followed next remains shrouded in mystery, even after 48 years: large numbers killed with over 400 injured as, according to news accounts, police opened fire. Those involved in the strike and affected by the incident vehemently argue that Gen Zia ordered troops to open fire on the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mystery also surrounds the number of casualties, with figures varying drastically — from state-reported counts of 14 deaths to union claims exceeding 200. The most widely-accepted figure among researchers and labour activists is 133, collated by the Mazdoor Action Committee, which was formed by local labour organisers in the wake of the massacre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to political activist and theorist Lal Khan, those desperately trying to escape the bullets were crushed in the ensuing stampede. When the firing began, workers’ families who lived within the mill’s residential compound came outside to get the bodies of their loved ones, but were prevented from retrieving them by law enforcement. The firing continued for three hours; by six in the evening, law enforcement had seized control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The burial site for such a large number also remains disputed, with testimonies suggesting that some victims were still alive when thrown among the dead. Testimonies available today mention two possible locations: one, a sewage drain where bodies were dumped by tractor; another, a hastily dug ditch. Multiple people in Multan, speaking to Eos on condition of anonymity, said that the bodies were buried so badly that scavenger animals picked at limbs protruding from the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aftermath and Denial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after the tragedy, the United States Department of State lauded Gen Zia for his human rights record, particularly with reference to arbitrary arrests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a report issued even a year after the tragedy, the US state department made no mention of the massacre. Instead, it reported that “The labour movement in Pakistan is limited by the relatively small size of the industrial sector.” The report acknowledged that “Martial Law regulations currently prohibit both strikes and political activity by unions.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, accounts of the true scale of the violence, contradicting the state narrative, had emerged from Multan. Urdu dailies Imroze and Mussawat had reported the firing, and the editor of Imroze Multan, Masood Ashar, was transferred to Lahore. The Karachi Workers Coordination Committee (KWCC) observed a week of mourning, and also announced that a fact-finding delegation was being sent to Multan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Punjab chapter of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) separately announced the formation of a five-member fact-finding committee. Labour unions across Pakistan — including the Muttahida Mazdoor Federation, the National Labour Federation and others — demanded a judicial inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Journalist organisations also condemned the suppression of accurate reporting. Separately, a meeting of journalists at the Karachi Press Club on January 8 asked for a new inquiry over the police firing at workers in SITE in June 1972, which they suspected was also a cover-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, ML administrators were adamant that knowledge of the event be suppressed. Intensifying pressure on workers at the textile mill, on March 12, a summary military court of Multan sentenced three labour leaders for organising a strike on February 16. Wasl Mohammad received one-and-a-half years of rigorous imprisonment (RI) and 15 lashes. Amir Ali and Abdul Khaliq received nine months RI and seven lashes and one year RI and 10 lashes respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Recognition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the scale of the violence, the state’s grip on affairs in Pakistan was such that no FIR was filed. Outside of the military inquiry, whose contents were never shared publicly, no official account exists. The government has never articulated what exactly happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The state has never accepted that the massacre took place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By contrast, the 1972 killings of labourers in Karachi have some recognition. The Pakistan Institute of Labour Education and Research (Piler) erected a memorial in Frontier Colony, Karachi, and the graves of the slain workers are painted red. At Colony Textile Mills, Multan, no memorial exists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cruelty of denial is still starkly present.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mughis Sheikh died in 2024 and former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani paid condolences to the family. Meanwhile, workers from January 2, 1978, still await justice and recognition. Yet on Pakistan’s 75th independence anniversary in 2022 , Punjab’s Labour and Human Resource Department awarded Colony Textile Mills a “Best Employer Award.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shows that, to this day, state and elite interests remain the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a way to dispel this notion: by making public the sealed military inquiry and convening an independent investigation to finally establish what really transpired that day.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SMOKERS’ CORNER: DOCTRINE DIORAMAS</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967648/smokers-corner-doctrine-dioramas</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the theatre of global politics, a ‘doctrine’ is more than just a policy paper. It is a nation’s strategic DNA. From the 1823 Monroe Doctrine, which fenced off the western hemisphere from European monarchs, to the 1947 Truman Doctrine that looked to aggressively ‘contain’ Soviet communism, these blueprints signal a country’s core values, and the consequences for those who cross them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1968, the Soviet Union introduced the Brezhnev Doctrine, asserting Moscow’s right to militarily intervene in socialist countries being threatened by capitalist/pro-US forces. Fast forward to the 21st century, and the blueprints have become increasingly aggressive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen the Bush Doctrine’s ‘strike first, ask questions later’ approach (‘preemptive strikes’), and Russia’s Gerasimov Doctrine, which treats disinformation and cyberattacks as the new artillery. We see the Xi Jinping Doctrine seeking to enhance China’s glory through the sprawling veins of the Belt and Road Initiative, while Donald Trump’s recent ‘Donroe’ Doctrine is an obsession with border walls, drug cartels and keeping Chinese influence out of ‘America’s backyard.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But doctrines are not static. They mutate. They adapt to the scent of power and economic reality. This is apparent in Pakistan as well. Pakistan began with its founder Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s high-minded idealism, but was quickly forced into a security-first straitjacket by the shadow of a much larger India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s national ‘doctrine’ has continued to mutate according to the whims of those in power, thus resulting in an often erratic and haphazard approach to strategy-building&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By 1958, the harsh realities of the Cold War had taken hold. Upon seizing power, Gen Ayub Khan established a doctrine that firmly anchored Pakistan within Western alliances. This manoeuvre was shaped to leverage US military and economic assistance to balance the scales with India, while simultaneously energising an ambitious industrialisation and modernisation programme at home. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ayub regime fell in 1969. Under another dictator, Gen Yahya Khan, the country’s eastern wing broke away in 1971 to become Bangladesh. Rising to power in the wake of the 1971 crisis, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, whose party had secured a majority in the country’s western wing during the 1970 elections, began to forge a new national path. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bhutto’s doctrine was designed to reinvent Pakistan’s identity and champion a strategy that moved away from heavy Western dependency in favour of stronger ties with oil-rich Arab states, the ‘Islamic Bloc’, and the burgeoning ‘Third World’ movement. Most significantly, the doctrine established the groundwork for Pakistan’s nuclear programme, which Bhutto envisioned as the essential equaliser to offset India’s military strength. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bhutto’s regime fell in a military coup in 1977. The coup-maker, Gen Ziaul Haq decided to stay on. A Zia Doctrine emerged. It prioritised a policy of domestic ‘Islamisation’, while positioning Pakistan as a frontline state in a US-backed anti-Soviet ‘Afghan jihad.’ Consequently, the Zia dictatorship secured extensive American support, which Zia used as a cover to accelerate the country’s nuclear programme under a cloak of plausible deniability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;media  sm:w-2/3  w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
				&lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/696c4e913400c.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
				
			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this era, the concept of ‘strategic depth’ also took root. This strategy sought to establish a pro-Pakistan government in Afghanistan, to ensure a secure territory where Pakistani armed forces could regroup in the event of conflict with India. Following Zia’s death in a 1988 plane crash, the Zia Doctrine remained a powerful influence over Pakistan’s foreign and domestic policies throughout the turbulent ‘decade of democracy’ that followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1999, the political landscape shifted again when Gen Pervez Musharraf seized power in a coup. Now there was a Musharraf Doctrine. It was fundamentally defined by the global upheaval of the 9/11 attacks. Adopting a ‘Pakistan first’ mantra, Musharraf attempted to balance a high-stakes role as a key US ally in the ‘War on Terror’ with a domestic social vision known as ‘enlightened moderation.’ &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the doctrine ultimately collapsed as the country faced the dual pressures of surging Islamist militancy and widespread internal unrest. From 2008 onward, a ‘hybrid system’ began to take shape, creating a political mechanism through which civilian governments were elected to office but remained tethered to strategic doctrines drafted by the military leadership. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A landmark shift occurred in 2013, with the emergence of the Raheel Sharif Doctrine, authored by the-then army chief. This doctrine represented a fundamental departure from traditional thinking by officially acknowledging that internal militancy posed a far greater existential threat to Pakistan than its historical rivalry with India. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This shift was swiftly operationalised through a massive military offensive launched to dismantle Islamist sanctuaries and neutralise militant networks. Then, a Bajwa Doctrine surfaced during the tenure of Imran Khan, marking an attempt by former army chief Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa to once again alter Pakistan’s national security focus. The core of this doctrine was a shift toward geo-economics, prioritising regional trade, transit and the infrastructure connectivity promised by the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, this vision ultimately fractured under the weight of mounting civil-military discord. While the military leadership sought regional stability to facilitate economic growth, the Khan administration remained preoccupied with an aggressive campaign against political rivals and a polarising effort to ‘rehabilitate’ Islamist militants. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This divergence in priorities, exacerbated by the stagnation of key CPEC projects, strained the working relationship between Khan and Bajwa. The resulting deadlock concluded in 2022, with Khan’s removal from office through a parliamentary vote of no-confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appointed as Bajwa’s successor by a Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N)-led coalition, Gen Asim Munir oversaw the emergence of what is often referred to as the ‘Munir Model.’ Its outcome is perhaps the most rooted institutionalisation of military authority in Pakistan’s history. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At its heart lies the concept of economic sovereignty, a framework where the military has moved to take a more active role in steering the nation’s economics. Strategically, the model is defined by a ‘zero-tolerance’ posture, as it maintains a relentless, uncompromising stance against Islamist militants and Baloch separatists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The model views internal security and economic stability as two sides of the same coin. By fusing state survival with economic growth and military muscle, the doctrine aims to project Pakistan as an assertive regional power. Geopolitically, the Munir Model is characterised by an intense anti-India tilt. It is deeply pro-China, and closely aligned with Saudi Arabia, while maintaining a pragmatic engagement with the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Domestically, the model identifies political populism as an existential threat to the state’s functional integrity. Notably, the doctrine seeks to trim the Islamist dimension from Pakistani nationalism that was added by the Zia Doctrine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Munir’s doctrine remains rooted in Pakistani nationalism, it replaces Islamist fervour with a brand of ‘rational Islam’ and hard-nosed pragmatism. The model has been a success on many fronts, but it will continue to be tested in an increasingly turbulent and mutating geopolitical landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Basmati boom propels Pakistan past Vietnam</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967625/basmati-boom-propels-pakistan-past-vietnam</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Pakistan’s rice exports recorded a strong rebound in December 2025, registering a 14 per cent month-on-month (MoM) increase compared to November, primarily driven by a more than 50pc surge in Basmati shipments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The impressive performance enabled Pakistan to overtake Vietnam and emerge as the world’s third-largest rice exporter, behind India and Thailand, during the month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to trade data, Pakistan exported 489,000 tonnes of rice in December 2025, excluding shipments to Iran, compared to Vietnam’s 387,000 tonnes. This marks Pakistan’s best monthly rice export performance, underscoring renewed momentum in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UAE remained the top destination for Pakistani rice, importing 74,897 tonnes, including 16,850 tonnes of Basmati. China followed closely with 74,685 tonnes, while other major destinations included Tanzania (62,900 tonnes), Kenya (60,300 tonnes), Ivory Coast (41,700 tonnes), Guinea-Bissau (31,850 tonnes), Malaysia (23,930 tonnes), Madagascar (17,800 tonnes), Kazakhstan (17,050 tonnes), Saudi Arabia (16,032 tonnes, including 5,350 tonnes of Basmati), the EU and UK combined (21,100 tonnes, including 15,600 tonnes of Basmati), Oman (5,770 tonnes), the United States (2,230 tonnes), and Canada (1,321 tonnes).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;December surge boosts rankings despite structural challenges&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A notable development during December was Pakistan’s growing footprint in Central Asian markets. Exports to Kazakhstan exceeded 17,000 tonnes, including 10,300 tonnes of Basmati, while shipments to Uzbekistan stood at 10,382 tonnes. Industry experts say this reflects a structural shift, as Pakistan is now exporting directly to Central Asian states such as Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan. Previously, much of this trade moved indirectly through Afghanistan, but the closure of the Afghan border has prompted direct export routes, making Pakistan’s presence in the region more visible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the encouraging December figures, the rice export sector continues to face deep-rooted challenges. Structural, financial, marketing, and capacity-related weaknesses persist, with one of the most significant gaps being Pakistan’s negligible exports to Iraq — currently the world’s second-largest importer of Indian Basmati rice after Saudi Arabia. Similarly, Pakistan’s exports to Turkiye, a key transit hub for Iraq, Jordan, Syria, and parts of Eastern Europe, remain minimal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has recently directed authorities to formulate a comprehensive strategy to boost rice exports and reduce the widening trade deficit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Government officials have attributed the downturn to low-priced Indian rice and phytosanitary rejections at borders. However, exporters argue that Pakistan’s rice sector is suffering primarily due to policy missteps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hamid Malik, a rice sector analyst, says the causes include intense global competition, higher global production — especially in India — weakening international demand, rising ocean freight and logistics costs, inconsistent fiscal and monetary policies, irrational regulatory frameworks, inflated domestic prices caused by hoarding and undocumented money, and security-related border closures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid these challenges, Malik sees several positive developments as a silver lining. “There is strong demand for Pakistani rice in Bangladesh, although higher freight costs have eroded competitiveness.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Central Asian states are also emerging as promising markets since the start of Pakistan’s harvesting season in October 2025. Additionally, a 50pc tariff imposed by the United States on Indian rice exports has begun to benefit Pakistan, with shipments to the US gradually picking up, says Abu Bakr, an exporter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another significant development is unfolding in Iran, where foreign exchange shortages have led the Iranian Central Bank to stop issuing subsidised foreign exchange for rice imports. Iranian traders are now importing rice using their own funds, a shift that has favoured Pakistan due to geographic proximity. Pakistani exporters report a surge in Iranian demand, while Indian exporters have been adversely affected.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Talk of Gen Z bringing about change in the world is quite overrated, moot told</title>

				&lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Dr S. Akbar Zaidi speaks as Dr Masuma Hasan, Dr Kaiser Bengali and Dr Muhammad Abid Rao look on.—Fahim Siddiqi / White Star&lt;/figcaption&gt;
			&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;			&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KARACHI: Strains on the global economy, the uprising of Generation Z and its growing impact, as well as issues of war, deterrence and escalation in the world largely shaped 2025 as the Pakistan Institute of International Affairs (PIIA) reviewed the state of global politics on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chairperson of PIIA, diplomat and scholar Dr Masuma Hasan reminded how the past year was full of conflicts, the worst of which was in Gaza. “There was also Sudan where 12 million Sudanese left their own country, there was the Ukraine war, strikes on Iran, while in Haiti, criminal gangs ruled the country. Also, there was the crisis in Venezuela where the president was kidnapped by the United States of America. And in between there were tensions between the US and China and the US and the European Union. Still, the Gaza genocide overshadowed all other conflicts,” said Dr Hasan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economist Dr Kaiser Bengali also said that the turbulence created by  the US in 2025 is not likely to go away. He also said that talk of  Generation Z bringing about change in the world is quite overrated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Every  generation is different from the previous generation. And every  previous generation has contributed something or the other to the world.  So to say that this is the generation that is going to change the world  is not correct as the world has also been changing,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;State of global politics reviewed in PIIA seminar&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The  Gen Z revolts that have been taking place have not delivered anything.  The spring revolutions that came did not deliver anything and ultimately  the status quo came back, though maybe with different faces and  different names,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In Bangladesh, nothing will  change. The same elite is going to run the country. The only change that  has happened is in Sri Lanka where a Leftist party has come into power.  Otherwise, Sri Lanka has always been ruled by one or two families. In  Pakistan, we overthrew Ayub Khan, we overthrew Musharraf through mass  protests but then we found that we were still where we began. No change.  So I think that this entire Gen Z thing and its revolt is overrated  because change never comes by mobs on the street. In Iran, too, the  protests are already dying down and the Ayatollah will continue to rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You  need to have an organised resistance. Until and unless there is  organised resistance you cannot sustain your movement and bring about  the changes that you want to bring. And the thing about organised  movement is that you need to organise around a strategy,” Dr Bengali  explained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘We are living in the era and aura of Trump’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economist and Executive Director of the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) Dr S. Akbar Zaidi added to that by saying that “We are living in the era and aura of the US President Donald Trump. His is a muscular government,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“There are especially two instances under the current US President that have shown the military might and the precision of the military might of the US that we had not seen for many decades,” said Dr Zaidi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Earlier, there had been many attempts by the US government to intervene to change governments but two things that they did in the last seven months show the precision and military science of the US Army that has Donald Trump as its commander-in-chief. One was about Iran, where the planes flew from the middle of the United States to bomb where Iran’s nuclear facilities were supposed to be. And another thing was the recent kidnapping of Maduro, the president of Venezuela. It was a raid, not an invasion,” he pointed out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“This has been written about as a lurch to the past, a new kind of imperialism. It is a resource imperialism. It is interesting to see that unlike Iraq or Libya and other places where the mantra was democracy or regime change, in the case of Venezuela it is nothing of the sort. Trump has said that he now runs Venezuela. And it is all for and about oil. It is no longer about democracy or regime change, it is about power and natural resources. The US national defence strategy of 2025 under Trump says that ‘the United States cannot allow any nation to become so dominant that it could threaten our interests’.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, speaking about war, deterrence and escalation in the world, Air Vice Marshal Dr Muhammad Abid Rao, who is a member of the research faculty of the PAF Air War College, said that in America, their economy is largely based on the sale of weapons. Therefore, it is very important for America to have a war at any given time in different parts of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If you see from 1945, America came and settled in Europe and the Pacific region and till today they have not vacated those bases, be it UK, Belgium, Holland or Germany. France is the only country there which did not allow the Americans to make a base there. If you see the Pacific to the Philippines, to Japan to Thailand and so many other islands, you will find American bases there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“They had missed out on the Middle East. So in 1990, America prompted Iraq to take over Kuwait. That gave America an excuse to have the first Gulf War. So they attacked and destroyed Iraq and made bases there. Today, they have bases in Oman, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia. Iraq is wiped out, so is Syria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Let me take you back to the Arab-Israel war of 1973. There were moments in that October war when Israel would have collapsed had the Americans not warned them about the Egyptian surprise attack. Israel and America then formulated the policy that any country who has the potential or capability to threaten Israel should be neutralised,” the Air Vice Marshal explained.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh meet with ICC to request relocation of T20 World Cup matches</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967503/bangladesh-meet-with-icc-to-request-relocation-of-t20-world-cup-matches</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has had “constructive” discussions with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over moving their Twenty20 World Cup matches from India to Sri Lanka, the country’s governing body said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Uncertainty looms over Bangladesh’s participation in the Twenty20 World Cup following an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;earlier request&lt;/a&gt; by the BCB to the ICC to move their World Cup matches out of India over safety concerns amid political tensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCB and ICC officials met in Dhaka on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the discussions, the BCB reiterated its formal request to the ICC to relocate Bangladesh’s matches to Sri Lanka,” the BCB said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board also shared the Bangladesh government’s views and concerns on safety and security of the team, Bangladeshi fans, media and other stakeholders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh are in World Cup’s Group C and will play West Indies, England and Italy in Kolkata before facing Nepal in Mumbai. The tournament will be co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka from February 7 to March 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions have heightened in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962902&quot;&gt;recent weeks&lt;/a&gt; between Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds protested near Bangladesh’s High Commission in New Delhi last month after a Hindu factory worker was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808#:~:text=lynching%20of%20a%20Hindu%20man%20over%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy.&quot;&gt;beaten and set on fire&lt;/a&gt; in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district over blasphemy allegations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>U-19 World Cup: No handshake between India and Bangladesh at toss but players shake hands after game</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967495/u-19-world-cup-no-handshake-between-india-and-bangladesh-at-toss-but-players-shake-hands-after-game</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The captains of India and Bangladesh skipped the customary handshake during the toss of their U-19 World Cup match but the two sides did shake hands at the end of the game, which the former won.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the toss, Bangladesh’s acting captain Zawad Abrar and India’s captain Ayush Mhatre did not do the customary handshake at the pre-match toss, which the former won.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StarSportsIndia/status/2012439350018252870&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There were, however, handshakes between the teams at the end of the game, which India won by 18 runs (DLS method),” &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/india-vs-bangladesh-no-handshakes-at-toss-but-players-shake-hands-after-game-1519897&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESPN Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also quoted a statement from the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) as saying that the “absence of a handshake with the opposition captain was completely unintentional and resulted from a momentary lapse in concentration”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was no intent whatsoever to show discourtesy or disregard towards the opposition,” the report quoted the BCB as saying in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board has viewed the matter with due seriousness, as upholding the spirit of cricket and respect for opponents is a fundamental prerequisite for representing Bangladesh at any level and immediately advised the team management accordingly,” the BCB was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The players have also been reminded of their responsibility to maintain the highest standards of sportsmanship, camaraderie and mutual respect in all interactions with opposing teams,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that Indian cricketers had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942082&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts during last year’s Asia Cup matches, in the aftermath of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials&quot;&gt;military conflict&lt;/a&gt; between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s development comes as Bangladesh has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it will not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has played in the IPL for other teams in previous editions, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million. His sacking sparked fury in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the International Cricket Council to shift their games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, during a video conference with the ICC, the BCB &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966813&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it had “reiterated its request for the ICC to consider relocating Bangladesh’s matches outside India”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations between India and Bangladesh had soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808#:~:text=lynching%20of%20a%20Hindu%20man%20over%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy.&quot;&gt;hostility&lt;/a&gt; against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Vihaan Malhotra&apos;s brilliant 4/14 spell triggered a dramatic Bangladesh collapse, securing an 18-run DLS victory for India in a rain-hit Under 19 World Cup match. Despite a strong start in their chase, Bangladesh faltered against Malhotra&apos;s spin, falling short of the revised target. Earlier, Kundu and Sooryavanshi anchored India&apos;s innings.</description>

      <title>No handshake between India, Bangladesh at toss during U-19 World Cup match</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Tensions between India and Bangladesh were apparent on Saturday as the two sides skipped the customary handshake between the captains during the toss of a U-19 World Cup match in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s acting captain Zawad Abrar and India’s captain Ayush Mhatre did not do the customary handshake at the pre-match toss, which the former won.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that Indian cricketers had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942082&quot;&gt;refused&lt;/a&gt; to shake hands with their Pakistani counterparts during last year’s Asia Cup matches, in the aftermath of a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials&quot;&gt;military conflict&lt;/a&gt; between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Saturday’s development comes as Bangladesh has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it will not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has played in the IPL for other teams in previous editions, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million. His sacking sparked fury in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the International Cricket Council to shift their games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, during a video conference with the ICC, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966813&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it had “reiterated its request for the ICC to consider relocating Bangladesh’s matches outside India”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations between India and Bangladesh had soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808#:~:text=lynching%20of%20a%20Hindu%20man%20over%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy.&quot;&gt;hostility&lt;/a&gt; against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s domestically assembled JF-17 Thunder fighter jet, and its performance against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/india&quot;&gt;India&lt;/a&gt;, have been at the centre of an ambitious drive to expand defence exports.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the oil-rich Gulf to North Africa and Southeast Asia, Islamabad is marketing the multi-role aircraft as a combat-tested, lower-cost alternative to western platforms, targeting countries constrained by budget limitations or wary of the political conditions that accompany major arms deals with the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s sales pitch was buoyed after a four-day air confrontation with India in May 2025, which Pakistani officials cite as a real-world demonstration of the country’s integrated air-combat capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the military balance sheet of the clash remains contested, Islamabad has seized on the episode to recast the JF-17 as not only affordable but operationally credible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The JF-17 Thunder Block III is a single-engine, fourth-generation fighter jointly developed by the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex and China’s Chengdu Aircraft Corporation and assembled in Pakistan.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Chinese-made Pakistani fighter jet shot down at least one French Rafale&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/chinese-made-pakistani-fighter-jet-shot-down-least-one-rafale-jet&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long promoted as a budget-friendly option for smaller air forces, the aircraft is now being presented by Pakistani officials as a frontline platform capable of operating in high-intensity conflict.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts believe interest has risen across the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Eurasia, as geopolitical realignments prompt states to look beyond traditional western suppliers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concrete details of potential contracts remain closely guarded, however, with most information emerging through unnamed official sources rather than signed agreements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Raza Hayat Hiraj, Pakistan’s minister for defence production, told BBC Urdu this week that talks were &quot;underway&quot; with several countries for the sale of the JF-17, declining to name them and describing the negotiations as involving “protected secrets”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Combat as credentials&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The export drive gained momentum after the four-day confrontation with India, the most intense exchange between the two air forces in decades.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precise balance of losses remains contested, but Islamabad has highlighted one symbolic claim in particular: that Pakistani aircraft brought down at least one of India’s French-made advanced Rafale fighters. New Delhi has neither confirmed nor denied the assertion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether or not the engagement altered the strategic equation, it achieved something just as valuable in the arms trade: it gave Pakistan a narrative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;The JF-17 is no longer just a budget option, but a battle-tested one&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;-&amp;nbsp;Muhammad Shoaib,&amp;nbsp;Quaid-i-Azam University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For years, Pakistan struggled to move the JF-17 beyond its reputation as a “budget” alternative to western jets, but the skirmish with India changed everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The Pakistan Air Force demonstrated superior performance against more expensive western platforms, including French-made Rafales,” Muhammad Shoaib, assistant professor at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad, told Middle East Eye. “This proved the JF-17 is no longer just a budget option, but a battle-tested one.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also noted that, unlike western systems, the JF-17 is exempt from the “political vetoes” and usage restrictions typically attached to American or European exports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That message has been amplified by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/us&quot;&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly praised Pakistani aviation performance while taking credit for the subsequent ceasefire - a claim that New Delhi flatly denies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such endorsements are unusual in US-Pakistan relations, which have long been defined by mutual mistrust.&amp;nbsp;But for Pakistani defence marketers, they have become a powerful tool.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, some analysts say the recent foreign interest is driven less by the aircraft itself and more by the perceived performance of the Pakistan Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Countries looking to make deals are impressed by the PAF after its performance in the May conflict with India and the combat learning and training derived from it,” Abdul Basit, senior associate fellow at Singapore’s S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, told MEE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In return, they are more inclined to purchase the JF-17.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Africa as a testing ground&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has already exported the JF-17 to Azerbaijan, Myanmar, and Nigeria.&amp;nbsp;Indonesia’s defence minister recently met Pakistan’s air force chief to discuss the possible purchase of the JF-17 and other defence products.&amp;nbsp;In Bangladesh, the political upheaval that followed the 2024 ousting of Sheikh Hasina has opened space for a recalibration of defence ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/iraq&quot;&gt;Iraq&lt;/a&gt;, Pakistani military diplomacy has intensified after a high-level visit by the air force chief to Baghdad in January, with Iraqi officials expressing “keen interest” in both the JF-17 and Pakistan’s Super Mushshak trainer aircraft, Pakistani &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/PTVNewsOfficial/status/2009908165115351244&quot;&gt;state-run PTV reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the strategy is yielding its most tangible dividends in Africa, a continent where great-power rivalry, internal conflicts, and expanding arms markets increasingly intersect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Pakistan on verge of $1.5bn deal to provide weapons and jets to Sudan&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pakistan-verge-sealing-15bn-deal-provide-weapons-and-jets-sudan&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/sudan&quot;&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/libya&quot;&gt;Libya&lt;/a&gt;, however, mark a qualitative shift: from limited sales to politically consequential defence partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Sudan, Pakistani officials told Reuters that negotiations are advanced on a defence package valued at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/pakistan-verge-sealing-15bn-deal-provide-weapons-and-jets-sudan&quot;&gt;about $1.5&lt;/a&gt;bn that would include JF-17 Block III fighters, K-8 attack aircraft, and more than 200 drones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal would bolster the Sudanese army, backed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/saudi-arabia&quot;&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/turkey&quot;&gt;Turkey&lt;/a&gt;, in its war against the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, which are supported by the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Libya offers an even starker illustration of the trend.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In December, Pakistan’s army chief, Field Marshal General Asim Munir, travelled to Benghazi to meet General Khalifa Haftar, commander of the Libyan National Army (LNA), which controls much of the country’s east and south.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visit reportedly culminated in a defence agreement valued at more than $4bn, the largest arms export deal in Pakistan’s history, covering JF-17 fighters, Super Mushshak trainers and a range of naval and ground systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although arms transfers to Libya remain politically sensitive under the United Nations embargo framework, Haftar described the agreement as the beginning of a “new phase of strategic military cooperation” with Pakistan, language that reflects how arms deals are increasingly framed as security partnerships rather than simple transactions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dozen JF-17s would give the LNA a “game-changing advantage in air power” over the UN-recognised government in Tripoli, which is backed by Turkey, according to a Forbes analysis published in December.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts also warned that such deals illustrate Pakistan’s growing willingness to operate in politically complex theatres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“These agreements embed Islamabad more deeply in African security calculations,” a western defence official based in Islamabad told MEE. “They also place Pakistan squarely within the competitive space between Gulf powers, China, and, increasingly, Russia and Turkey.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Saudi recalibration&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most striking sign of Pakistan’s changing role is emerging in its relationship with Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;This is essentially about&amp;nbsp;[Saudi Arabia] supporting Pakistan and building a strategic hedge&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Ayesha Siddiqa,&amp;nbsp;Pakistani defence analyst&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a development signalling a significant shift in regional defence architecture, Islamabad and Riyadh have signed a Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement. Following a destabilising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/israel&quot;&gt;Israeli&lt;/a&gt; strike on Doha in September, the pact commits both nations to treat an attack on one as aggression against both.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Talks have since shifted toward operationalising this alliance through a major procurement package. A recent Reuters report, citing Pakistani sources, suggests both sides are discussing converting $2bn of Saudi sovereign loans into an order for JF-17 fighter jets.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Pakistan’s foreign ministry maintains it is “unaware” of a formal deal, high-level diplomatic activity suggests serious intent. Pakistan’s air chief recently travelled to Riyadh to meet Lieutenant General Turki bin Bandar bin Abdulaziz, commander of the Royal Saudi Air Force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia’s air force remains heavily dependent on western hardware, including F-15s and the Thaad missile defence system. Even with Washington approving F-35 stealth aircraft sales to the kingdom, Riyadh’s interest in Pakistani platforms appears driven more by strategic calculation than tactical necessity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Saudi Arabia already has top-of-the-line aircraft; it does not really need the JF-17,” said Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani defence analyst. “This is essentially about supporting Pakistan and building a strategic hedge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She cautioned, however, that while the proposal has generated enthusiasm in Pakistan, concrete details remain limited and official confirmation is still pending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The emerging “hedge” reflects the gradual erosion of confidence in the US-Saudi security paradigm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riyadh’s trust was shaken by the muted American response to the 2019 Houthi attacks on oil facilities, the 2021 withdrawal of US missile defences, and the scaling back of support for Saudi operations in Yemen, according to an October analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now Pakistan, with its nuclear deterrent, professional military, and deep ties to China, suddenly appears less like a junior partner and more like a strategic hedge.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turkish officials have hinted that Ankara is in “advanced” discussions to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/turkey-advanced-talks-join-saudi-arabia-and-pakistan-defence-pact-report&quot;&gt;join the framework&lt;/a&gt;, Bloomberg reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, a sign of what analysts describe as a broader recalibration of regional security alliances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The elephant in the room: China&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet behind every JF-17 export discussion looms a larger presence: China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The aircraft may carry a Pakistani flag on its tail, but nearly half its components - especially critical avionics and radar systems - are manufactured in China. Any export deal requires Beijing’s approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistani officials acknowledge this openly. “Some components of the JF-17 are manufactured in China, while others are produced in Pakistan,” Defence Production Minister Hiraj told BBC Urdu. “Consequently, China will be a party to any agreement we enter into with third parties.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Basit characterises China as the “dominant partner” in the relationship, pointing to Beijing’s grip on core technologies and its control over production scaling. Consequently, any surge in global sales demands more than just industrial growth; it requires delicate diplomatic synchronicity with Beijing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, analyst Shoaib notes a strategic advantage for Beijing: many nations desire Chinese hardware but prefer the “Pakistani buffer” to avoid the direct diplomatic friction or “western anger” that comes with buying directly from China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Economics and capacity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, the stakes are not only strategic but existentially economic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The country is currently under its twenty-fourth International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, a $7bn arrangement that followed a last-minute bailout in 2023.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia and other Gulf allies helped stabilise the economy with deposit rollovers and emergency financing. Now, defence exports are being cast as a pathway out of a permanent crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore mee-readmore-article-story mee-readmore-type-image align-right&quot;&gt;
  &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-img-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/saudi-arabia-and-pakistan-talks-swap-loans-jf-17-warplanes-report&quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;alt&quot; class=&quot;mee-readmore-image&quot; height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/sites/default/files/styles/read_more/public/images-story/Pakistan-Saudi-Arabia-leaders-AFP.jpg.webp?itok=YVd7WU5q&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s defence minister, Khawaja Asif, has recently claimed that the scale of potential orders could one day free Pakistan from reliance on the IMF, a bold assertion that is not yet grounded in economic reality.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts say arms exports alone cannot resolve Pakistan’s structural economic problems, but they could provide a rare source of high-value foreign exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Even a handful of major contracts would have a meaningful impact on Pakistan’s balance of payments,” an Islamabad-based economist at a multinational firm told MEE, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. “But the risk is that expectations are being raised faster than delivery capacity.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan has already established a symbolic export record with the JF-17.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Myanmar first ordered 16 aircraft in 2015, followed by Nigeria’s induction in 2021. Azerbaijan became the flagship customer, signing a landmark $1.6bn deal in 2024 for 16 jets, later expanded to 40. By late 2025, Baku formally inducted its first batch of Block III fighters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet serious questions remain about Pakistan’s industrial capacity to meet ambitious export targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“France produces only about 25 or 26 Rafale jets a year,” Basit said. “How can Pakistan realistically manufacture far more JF-17s if multiple orders materialise?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He warned that Islamabad should exercise caution before committing to large-scale deals it may struggle to fulfil, particularly at a time when India is expanding its own air-combat inventory with additional Rafale purchases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“In such a situation, Pakistan must also keep a close eye on its own stock of JF-17s,” he said, arguing that export enthusiasm should not come at the expense of domestic force readiness.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;After former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s ousting in August 2024, Bangladesh has emerged as a test case for democratic transition and regional power politics.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In February 2026 Bangladesh will revert to democratic rule following elections and a referendum on the July charter. The new government will face a plethora of challenges, including reviving the economy, addressing demographic pressures, and healing the divides caused by the previous regime. There is also potential for renewed social unrest if voters perceive a return to business as usual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relations with India, China, Pakistan and the US will also be priorities for a new administration. Navigating the current geopolitical turbulence will not be easy for any new government, not least for a country with the level of social, economic, political and historical baggage as Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What happens in Bangladesh offer lessons to other countries in South Asia and the Global South, notably those who have experienced Gen Z protests in recent months. How Bangladesh recovers and implements its renewed democracy will be a prominent signal for other countries in the region and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>India is facing multiple geopolitical challenges in the region as Bangladesh and Myanmar show signs of drifting away from New Delhi’s orbit amid its long-standing disputes with Pakistan and China.
Dhaka has been drawing closer to Islamabad following the downfall in 2024 of its former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who had close ties with Delhi during her rule, while China has continued to maintain its influence in Myanmar since the junta in Naypyidaw ousted the elected government in a coup in...</description>

      <description>The ICC is expected to visit Bangladesh for discussions regarding the national team&apos;s participation in the 2026 ICC T20 World Cup. Bangladesh&apos;s sports ministry and cricket board are firm on not traveling to India due to security concerns, insisting matches be played only in Sri Lanka. Dialogue continues to explore solutions.</description>

      <title>Multipolar South Asia</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967277/multipolar-south-asia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;SOUTH Asia remained largely bipolar during the Cold War era due to India’s inward-looking approach and Pakistan’s proactive alignment with the West.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the balance of power steadily shifted in India’s favour in the first quarter of the 21st century. Islamabad’s internal security and economic fragility, a pro-India regime in Dhaka, Delhi’s rising economic profile, Beijing’s hesitation to proactively engage in South Asia’s security and strategic affairs and Washington’s decision to embolden India as a bulwark against China led to the emergence of a belligerent India in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Change is the only constant in international affairs. This also applies to South Asia, where the region is witnessing profound geopolitical shifts. Today, Pakistan wants to reclaim its political space in South Asia. Beijing is eager to expand its footprint in the region, while Dhaka is showing defiance against Delhi’s assertive policies and domestic interference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamabad considers it a conducive environment for promoting the idea of a ‘multipolar’ South Asia. Islamabad believes that a resurgent Pakistan, assertive Bangladesh and proactive China can effectively limit Indian influence and reclaim its strategic space in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the South Asian context, multipolarity does not imply the emergence of several equal great powers, but rather the dilution of India’s structural dominance through the rise of alternative and consequential regional pillars. Multipolarity, as envisaged by Islamabad, signifies a regional order in which China, Bangladesh and Pakistan emerge as equally important strategic, economic and political poles alongside India, rather than remaining peripheral or subordinate actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Asian states have already welcomed Chinese economic activities under the Belt &amp;amp; Road Initiative. Now, Islamabad envisages a proactive approach by Beijing in establishing sub-regional forums sans India, and deeper technological and security cooperation with smaller South Asian states. Similarly, Islamabad is trying to embolden Dhaka as an assertive power within the South Asian region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamabad has calculated that a politically independent, economically stable and militarily assertive Dhaka will challenge India’s assertive policies. A stronger Bangladesh with advanced air and naval power will challenge Delhi’s uncontested influence in the Bay of Bengal. Hence, an emboldened Dhaka will indirectly complement Islamabad’s strategic overtures in South Asia. This is why Islamabad is strengthening Dhaka’s defence through deepening cooperation in the naval, air and military domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A multipolar South Asia will limit Delhi’s ability to unilaterally shape the norms of regional forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multipolarity in South Asian affairs will introduce several strategic and political opportunities for the regional states. First, the significance of smaller South Asian states such as the Maldives, Sri Lanka, Nepal and Bhutan will increase in a multipolar South Asia as the competing powers will likely try to persuade them to join their respective blocs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, a multipolar South Asia will also increase strategic and political options for smaller South Asian states. Historically, the smaller South Asian states did not enjoy abundant strategic options; rather, they had to rely only on India. In a multipolar South Asia, smaller states will have the diplomatic flexibility to adopt an issue-based cooperation strategy on trade, energy, climate, security, etc, rather than entering into rigid bloc politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, a multipolar South Asia will limit Delhi’s ability to unilaterally shape the norms of regional forums. For instance, Delhi’s unilateral decision to boycott Saarc in 2016 paralysed the only regional forum in South Asia. However, a multipolar South Asia will create space for alternative sub-regional frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, attempts for the establishment of a multipolar South Asia will enhance Pakistan’s regional and global political profile as a facilitator of multi-vector regional alignment rather than simply being a bilateral rival of India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, there are significant risks involved in promoting the idea of a multipolar South Asia. First, Islamabad’s attempts towards the establishment of a multipolar South Asia will lead to another episode of intense geopolitical competition within the region. This intensified geopolitical competition will adversely affect efforts for regional connectivity. In this intense competitive environment, South Asian states will prioritise sub-regional forums over regional frameworks as consensus-building in a regional forum is perhaps near impossible. One practical manifestation is the growing emphasis on mini-lateral frameworks that operate outside India-centric regional institutions. The establishment of the Bangladesh-China-Pakistan strategic forum reflects this evolving trend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Delhi will resist a multipolar South Asia through economic resources, diplomatic campaigns and establishing strategic partnerships with its neighbouring countries to reassert its primacy in the region. These strategies will add pressure on the foreign policy of smaller South Asian states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, the uncertain domestic political environment of Bangladesh with its inconsistent foreign policy approaches, and long-standing Pakistan-Bangladesh issues such as Dhaka’s demands for an apology for the 1971 events and repayment of assets in undivided Pakistan, may hinder efforts towards a strengthened and effective multipolar South Asia in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning, Islamabad has been concerned about the South Asian region becoming hostage to a single dominating power. While smaller South Asian states, too, had inherent insecurities on account of India, they tried to address them through engagement with New Delhi — on the latter’s terms. Islamabad, on the contrary, tried to challenge Indian dominance with a two-pronged strategy. Externally, it formed an alliance with the West to militarily enable itself against India, while within the region, it made efforts to establish a regional organisation (Saarc) in 1985 with the help of smaller South Asian states to defy the single country’s dominance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islamabad considers it another ‘1985 moment’, when it successfully aligned with smaller South Asian states and persuaded New Delhi to operate as one stakeholder among many, rather than as the region’s sole arbiter. The critical question is whether Islamabad’s push for a multipolar South Asia will replicate its 1985 success or reinforce regional polarisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The writer is an analyst of South Asian affairs. The views expressed are his own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A report highlights 15 Hindu minority murders in Bangladesh by Muslims between December 2025 and January 2026.  The Interim Government, led by Chief Advisor Dr. Muhammad Yunus, is reportedly dismissing these attacks as disinformation.

      <title>US immigrant visa processing pause: Pakistanis will still be able to submit applications, attend scheduled interviews</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967126/us-immigrant-visa-processing-pause-pakistanis-will-still-be-able-to-submit-applications-attend-scheduled-interviews</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: The US State Department has clarified that applicants from Pakistan and 74 other countries, which are facing a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966944&quot;&gt;suspension of immigrant visa processing&lt;/a&gt;, will be allowed to submit applications and attend scheduled interviews despite the freeze. However, no immigrant visas will be issued during the newly announced pause that takes effect on January 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/News/visas-news/immigrant-visa-processing-updates-for-nationalities-at-high-risk-of-public-benefits-usage.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;question-and-answer guidance&lt;/a&gt; released alongside the new policy, the department said that the suspension does not revoke any immigrant visas already issued, nor does it apply to tourist or other non-immigrant visas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Questions related to admission into the United States, it added, fell under the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance also states that dual nationals applying with a valid passport from a country not included on the affected list are exempt from the pause.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is among more the 75 countries whose nationals will be affected under the new measure, which the State Department said is part of a comprehensive review ordered by President Donald Trump to ensure that immigrants are “financially self-sufficient and not a financial burden to Americans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Trump has made clear that immigrants must be financially self-sufficient,” the department said, adding that all policies, regulations and guidance are being reviewed to prevent immigrants from becoming a public charge.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sweeping list spans Africa, Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and eastern Europe, and includes countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Egypt, Nigeria, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, Sudan, Syria, Russia and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to internal guidance cited by officials, exceptions may be granted if an applicant can demonstrate that their travel would serve an “America First” national interest, though the criteria for such exemptions have not been publicly defined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guidance also instructs consular officers that if an immigrant visa has already been approved but has not yet been printed, the case must be refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department said US embassies and consulates will continue to schedule immigrant visa appointments for affected nationals during the pause, but issuance will remain suspended while the review is underway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh Cricket Board removes director Najmul Islam amid player boycott</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967108/bangladesh-cricket-board-removes-director-najmul-islam-amid-player-boycott</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) on Thursday removed director Najmul Islam following protests from players ahead of Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) matches over his comments against the country’s cricketers, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first BPL match scheduled for 1pm local time today was delayed as players from Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express did not show up at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium for the game, according to &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/sports-special/bpl-2026/news/thursdays-first-bpl-match-hit-boycott-4081616&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was handed a show-cause notice by the BCB a few hours before the match was set to begin. However, the Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) had called for a nationwide boycott on all forms of cricket unless Islam tenders his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a media release today, the BCB said the decision to remove Islam was taken by president Aminul Islam Bulbul “following a review of recent developments and in the best interest of the organisation”, and that it would come into effect immediately, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/cricket/news/bcb-removes-director-najmul-finance-role-amid-player-boycott-4081746&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The decision has been taken in accordance with the authority vested in the BCB President under Article 31 of the BCB Constitution and is aimed at ensuring the continued smooth and effective functioning of the Board’s affairs,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Board remains fully committed to upholding the honour and dignity of all players under its jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this regard, the BCB hopes that all cricketers will continue to display the highest standards of professionalism and dedication to the betterment of Bangladesh cricket, and will do their utmost to ensure continued participation in the Bangladesh Premier League,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until further notice, Bulbul will serve as the acting chairman of the finance committee that Islam was the chair of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam had said on Wednesday night that he believes national cricketers should be asked to return the “crores and crores of taka” that the BCB spends on them, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/bangladesh-cricketers-threaten-boycott-unless-bcb-director-nazmul-islam-resigns-1519512&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESPN Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB officially distanced itself from Islam’s comments and expressed its “sincere regret for remarks that may be deemed inappropriate, offensive, or hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bangladesh Cricket Board also makes it clear that it will take appropriate disciplinary action against any individual whose conduct or comments show disrespect towards cricketers or cause harm to the reputation and integrity of Bangladesh cricket,” the board said in a statement, per &lt;em&gt;Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boycott was proposed by Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB), hours after Islam’s press conference at the BCB’s headquarters in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The remark made by the BCB director [Najmul Islam] has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly, and it’s not acceptable,” Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We demand his resignation. If he doesn’t resign before tomorrow’s match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow (Thursday).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;, Najmul said the board owes no compensation to players if Bangladesh miss the upcoming world cup, arguing that the BCB has never sought refunds from cricketers after poor performances at global events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question [of compensation] does not even arise. We have invested so much [in] them, they haven’t been able to achieve anything, anywhere,” &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; quoted Islam as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have we won a single global trophy till now? Then we could’ve said every time, you have failed to perform, whatever we have spent on you, now we will take it back. Return it to us,” Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam’s comments came amid Bangladesh’s standoff with the International Cricket Council (ICC) over its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966750&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to travel to India for next month’s T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka, which is co-hosting the tournament beginning February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, led by Litton Das, are &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/team-rankings/mens/t20i&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;placed ninth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the ICC T20 rankings. They have played all nine editions of the tournament, but have never qualified for the semi-finals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh cricket sees local turmoil after players boycott premier league match, director given show-cause notice</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1967108/bangladesh-cricket-sees-local-turmoil-after-players-boycott-premier-league-match-director-given-show-cause-notice</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh cricket took a hit as players boycotted the first Bangladesh Premier League (BPL) match on Thursday and demanded the resignation of Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) Director Najmul Islam after he was handed a show-cause notice following controversial comments against the country’s cricketers on Wednesday, &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; reported.*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes amid Bangladesh’s standoff with the International Cricket Council over its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966750&quot;&gt;refusal&lt;/a&gt; to travel to India for next month’s ICC T20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka, which is co-hosting the tournament beginning February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first BPL match scheduled for 1pm local time today was delayed as players from Chattogram Royals and Noakhali Express did not show up at the Sher-e-Bangla National Cricket Stadium for the game, according to &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/sports/sports-special/bpl-2026/news/thursdays-first-bpl-match-hit-boycott-4081616&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam was handed a show-cause notice by the BCB a few hours before the match was set to begin. However, the Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB) has called for a nationwide boycott on all forms of cricket unless Islam tenders his resignation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Islam, the board’s finance committee chairman, said on Wednesday night that he believes national cricketers should be asked to return the “crores and crores of taka” that the BCB spends on them, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/bangladesh-cricketers-threaten-boycott-unless-bcb-director-nazmul-islam-resigns-1519512&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;ESPN Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB officially distanced itself from Islam’s comments and expressed its “sincere regret for remarks that may be deemed inappropriate, offensive, or hurtful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Bangladesh Cricket Board also makes it clear that it will take appropriate disciplinary action against any individual whose conduct or comments show disrespect towards cricketers or cause harm to the reputation and integrity of Bangladesh cricket,” the board said in a statement, per &lt;em&gt;Cricinfo&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The boycott was proposed by Mohammad Mithun, president of the Cricketers’ Welfare Association of Bangladesh (CWAB), hours after Islam’s press conference at the BCB’s headquarters in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The remark made by the BCB director [Najmul Islam] has hurt the cricket fraternity greatly, and it’s not acceptable,” Mithun told reporters on Wednesday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We demand his resignation. If he doesn’t resign before tomorrow’s match, we will announce a boycott of all cricket, starting from the BPL matches tomorrow (Thursday).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;, Najmul said the board owes no compensation to players if Bangladesh miss the upcoming world cup, arguing that the BCB has never sought refunds from cricketers after poor performances at global events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The question [of compensation] does not even arise. We have invested so much [in] them, they haven’t been able to achieve anything, anywhere,” &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; quoted Islam as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Have we won a single global trophy till now? Then we could’ve said every time, you have failed to perform, whatever we have spent on you, now we will take it back. Return it to us,” Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, led by Litton Das, are &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/team-rankings/mens/t20i&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;placed ninth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the ICC T20 rankings. They have played all nine editions of the tournament, but have never qualified for the semi-finals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>US announces suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan, 74 other countries from Jan 21</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966944/us-announces-suspension-of-immigrant-visa-processing-for-pakistan-74-other-countries-from-jan-21</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: The US has announced a suspension of immigrant visa processing for Pakistan and 74 other countries, effective January 21, citing concerns that immigrants from these nations often rely on public welfare programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State Department said the freeze will remain in place until authorities can ensure that new immigrants will not draw on American taxpayer resources.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/StateDept/status/2011478657680757214?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials described the measure as part of the administration’s “America First” approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused,” an official said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Department spokesperson Tommy Piggott said in a statement that his department “will use its long-standing authority to deem ineligible potential immigrants who would become a public charge on the United States and exploit the generosity of the American people“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Immigration from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassesses immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the countries affected by the freeze are Somalia, Haiti, Iran, Eritrea, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, covering regions in Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. All categories of US immigrant visas — including family, employment, and diversity visas — are impacted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#impact-on-pakistanis&quot; id=&quot;impact-on-pakistanis&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Impact on Pakistanis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The suspension could delay travel, study, and work plans for thousands of Pakistanis who annually seek US visas. Pakistani consulates in the US are expected to provide guidance to affected applicants in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#public-charge-rule&quot; id=&quot;public-charge-rule&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Public-charge rule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visa freeze is linked to the US public-charge rule, which evaluates whether immigrants are likely to rely on government assistance. While suspensions of visa services have occurred in the past, officials said the scope of this action is unprecedented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No timeline has been given for resuming visa services, but the State Department assured that countries would be notified once the review is complete.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ikkis: An Ode To A Valiant Indian Soldier</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/medley/ikkis-ode-valiant-indian-soldier</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The story of Arun’s role in the Battle of Basantar did not end on that day, or even after the cease fire of this two weeks war, resulting in the demise of East Pakistan and the announcement of the newly liberated Bangladesh. Major Khwaja  Mohammad Nasir, then a Squadron Commander of 13th Lancers, the regiment pitched against Poona Horse, who came bandaged the next day to collect the dead bodies of his fallen comrades, wanted to know more about “ the officer, who stood like an insurmountable rock” and whose troop of three British World War II vintage Centurion tanks  was responsible for decimation of his entire squadron of  fourteen American Patton tanks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-cutline&quot;&gt;The sign outside the US State Department building in Washington, DC, as seen on 11 July 2025 (Annabelle Gordon/Reuters)&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-wide-photo-video&quot;&gt;Off&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration on Wednesday announced that it will suspend the issuance of immigrant visas to the nationals of 75 countries, including Brazil, Iran, Russia, and Somalia, starting on 21 January.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The State Department will pause immigrant visa processing from 75 countries whose migrants take welfare from the American people at unacceptable rates,&quot; the agency said in a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;The freeze will remain active until the US can ensure that new immigrants will not extract wealth from the American people.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The statement said that the affected countries, &quot;including Somalia, Haiti, Iran, and&amp;nbsp;Eritrea&quot;, make for immigrants who &quot;often become public charges on the United States upon arrival&quot;, meaning they apply for and use government benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We are working to ensure the generosity of the American people will no longer be abused,&quot; the State Department said. &quot;The Trump Administration will always put America First.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has long been routine for asylum-seekers and refugees to the US, in particular, to access social welfare benefits via systems in each state designed to get them on their feet and ease them into the community.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with immigration to the US now at a nearly 50-year low because of the Trump administration&apos;s aggressive crackdown, it&apos;s likely those services will be significantly scaled back.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the full list of impacted countries was not announced by the government, a Fox News report citing an internal memo from the State Department named the following:&amp;nbsp;Afghanistan; Albania; Algeria; Antigua and Barbuda; Armenia; Azerbaijan; Bahamas; Bangladesh; Barbados; Belarus; Belize; Bhutan; Bosnia; Brazil; Burma; Cambodia; Cameroon; Cape Verde; Colombia; Cote d’Ivoire; Cuba; Democratic Republic of the Congo; Dominica; Egypt; Eritrea; Ethiopia; Fiji; Gambia; Georgia; Ghana; Grenada; Guatemala; Guinea; Haiti; Iran; Iraq; Jamaica; Jordan; Kazakhstan; Kosovo; Kuwait; Kyrgyzstan; Laos; Lebanon; Liberia; Libya; Macedonia; Moldova; Mongolia; Montenegro; Morocco; Nepal; Nicaragua; Nigeria; Pakistan; Republic of the Congo; Russia; Rwanda; Saint Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; Saint Vincent and the Grenadines; Senegal; Sierra Leone; Somalia; South Sudan; Sudan; Syria; Tanzania; Thailand; Togo; Tunisia; Uganda; Uruguay; Uzbekistan; and Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Non-immigrant visas, business visas, and tourist visas will not be impacted, the AP reported, but everyone coming to the US will face a heightened screening process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US is now five months away from hosting the Fifa 2026 World Cup along with Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Administration officials have previously said they expect some five million people or more to come to the US for the event, but independent analysts have put that number at below one million, given the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/world-cup-2026-us-gives-no-assurances-immigration-officers-wont-raid-stadiums&quot;&gt;more aggressive vetting&lt;/a&gt; procedures that could include searches of phones and social media accounts, as well as the risk of lengthy detentions without due process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;At least 100,000 visas revoked&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration has posited itself as the most &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/all-55-million-us-visa-holders-open-revocations-and-deportations-trump-administration-says&quot;&gt;anti-immigrant&lt;/a&gt; government yet, having so far &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/trump-has-revoked-100000-visas-foreign-nationals-since-trump-took-office&quot;&gt;revoked at least 100,000 visas&lt;/a&gt;, deported some &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/10/27/dhs-removes-more-half-million-illegal-aliens-us&quot;&gt;half a million&lt;/a&gt; immigrants, and put some 70,000 others in immigration detention centres that have been criticised for overcrowding, lack of hygiene, and poisoned food.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The US asylum programme has effectively been terminated, and temporary protected status (TPS) for those unable to return to unsafe countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/trump-administration-end-legal-protections-some-somalis-mid-march&quot;&gt;has been cancelled&lt;/a&gt; for Afghans, Syrians, Somalis, and Venezuelans, among others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security has been on a massive recruitment drive for agents who can act as bounty hunters and meet daily quotas for arresting suspected undocumented immigrants and even legal immigrants whose records contain encounters with law enforcement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Videos have gone viral of masked and heavily armed Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents violently dragging people out of their cars and away from their children.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of those arrested have not been seen since, prompting widespread fear among immigrant communities as well as naturalised US citizens, especially those who are visibly non-white or are overheard speaking languages other than English.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump has said he is considering revoking citizenship, and he has asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on banning &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-supreme-court-limits-judges-block-trump-order-birthright-citizenship&quot;&gt;birthright citizenship&lt;/a&gt; for non-American parents.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>US to suspend immigrant visa processing from 75 countries over public assistance concerns</title>
      <link>https://apnews.com/article/trump-immigration-visas-79909bd01e9e1e3dedde144f865a1b9d</link>

(AP Photo/Ramon Espinosa)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;p&gt;2026-01-14T17:07:28Z&lt;/p&gt;
                                        &lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (AP) — The State Department said Wednesday it will suspend the processing of immigrant visas for citizens of 75 countries, including Afghanistan, Iran, Russia and Somalia, whose nationals the Trump administration has deemed likely to require public assistance while living in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department, led by &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-cabinet-marco-rubio-secretary-of-state-nominee-39c378e19d0327a7f091f302daf8ca3e&quot;&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, said it had instructed consular officers to halt immigrant visa applications from the countries affected in accordance with &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/immigration-public-charge-trump-benefits-visas-0929b2c8f635479173929300cb683a27&quot;&gt;a broader order&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; issued in November that tightened rules around potential immigrants who might become “public charges” in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suspension, which will begin Jan. 21, will not apply to applicants seeking non-immigrant visas, or temporary tourist or business visas, who make up the vast majority of visa seekers. Demand for non-immigrant visas is expected to rise dramatically in the coming months and years due to the upcoming 2026 World Cup and 2028 Olympics both of which the U.S. will host or co-host.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt; “The Trump administration is bringing an end to the abuse of America’s immigration system by those who would extract wealth from the American people,” the department said in a statement. “Immigrant visa processing from these 75 countries will be paused while the State Department reassess immigration processing procedures to prevent the entry of foreign nationals who would take welfare and public benefits.”&lt;/p&gt;


    
        




    


&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump’s administration has already severely restricted immigrant and non-immigrant visa processing for citizens of dozens of countries, many of them in Africa, Asia and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
        
            
                
    
    &lt;a id=&quot;html-embed-module-e30000&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


    
    &lt;p&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;

            
        
    
    
&lt;p&gt;The November guidance on which Wednesday’s decision is based directed U.S. embassy and consulate officials to comprehensively and thoroughly vet visa applicants to demonstrate that they will not need to rely on public benefits from the government any time after their admission in the U.S. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;While federal law already required those seeking permanent residency or legal status to prove they wouldn’t be a public charge, Trump in his first term widened the range of benefit programs that could disqualify applicants, and the guidelines in the cable appear to go further in scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immigrants seeking entry into the U.S. already undergo a medical exam by a physician who’s been approved by a U.S. Embassy. They are screened for communicable diseases, like tuberculosis, and asked to disclose any history of drug or alcohol use, mental health conditions or violence. They’re also required to have a number of vaccinations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new directive expanded those with more specific requirements. It said consular officials must consider a range of specific details about people seeking visas, including their age, health, family status, finances, education, skills and any past use of public assistance regardless of the country. It also said they should assess applicants’ English proficiency and can do so by conducting interviews in English.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts said at the time it could further limit who gets to enter the country at a time when the Republican administration is already &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/refugees-admissions-cap-immigration-trump-administration-197a8ef1c9c219ce6167da4aba3f5a6e&quot;&gt;tightening those rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;The countries affected by the suspension announced on Wednesday are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belize, Bhutan, Bosnia, Brazil, Burma, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Colombia, Congo, Cuba, Dominica, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Grenada, Guatemala, Guinea, Haiti, Iran, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Lebanon, Liberia, Libya, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Nepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Republic of the Congo, Russia, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Uruguay, Uzbekistan and Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Several countries ‘actively’ engaged in talks with Pakistan for its fighter jets, confirms PM Shehbaz</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966927/several-countries-actively-engaged-in-talks-with-pakistan-for-its-fighter-jets-confirms-pm-shehbaz</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif confirmed on Wednesday that several countries were “actively” engaged in talks with Pakistan for its fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, reports had surfaced of Pakistan being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966192/iraqi-air-chief-praises-pafs-professionalism-expresses-keen-interest-in-jf-17-thunder-jets&quot;&gt;in talks&lt;/a&gt; with several friendly countries for a deal on the JF-17, a light combat aircraft jointly developed by Pakistan and China and produced in Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing a federal cabinet meeting, PM Shehbaz recalled Pakistan’s victory in a war last year — ostensibly a reference to the four-day military conflict with India in May 2025 — and said the demand for Pakistan’s fighter jets had increased since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There are several countries that are actively engaged in talks with Pakistan on this, and this will boost our defence production and benefit our economy,” the premier added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Defence Production Minister Raza Hayat Harraj also told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt; that Pakistan is engaged in discussions with “multiple” countries for the sale of &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pac.org.pk/jf-17&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;JF-17 Thunder&lt;/a&gt; fighter jets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These negotiations are taking place and they take some time. Many countries have shown interest in these aircraft,” the minister was quoted as saying in an interview with &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bbc.com/urdu/articles/cq6v9q1lmeqo&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, published on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I cannot take the name of any country. Neither can I tell on what level our negotiations are with any country,” he told the British broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When these jets are exported, then the world will know which countries have bought them,” the report quoted him as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stressed that such matters were a country’s “jealously guarded secrets”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harraj further said, “Firstly, we must ensure that we only sell [JF-17s] to those who are our friendly countries. So they are not used against us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that China is on board whenever Pakistan signs such a deal with any country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defence production minister highlighted that the jets were battle-tested during the four-day conflict with India last year: “The entire world’s air forces saw these jets’ performance during that time and praised it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minister termed the price of the jet “an important” aspect, detailing that while the average value of such planes around the world was $250-350 million, the JF-17 Thunder was cheaper.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the exact value, he told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;, “Its value is around $40-50m; this depends on the jet’s features, and the price can also be higher than this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When enquired about whether China also received a share from the sale, Harraj was quoted as saying, “A lot of matters are discussed on the table. China is definitely included in them; it should be and it is their right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#production-capacity-a-secret&quot; id=&quot;production-capacity-a-secret&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Production capacity a secret’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a question about Pakistan’s production capacity, especially considering the interest of several countries, the minister told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt;, “This is a question related to our national defence. These are our secrets, let them remain secrets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He stressed that producing such “state-of-the-art” jets was a time-consuming task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the minister, “some portion of the jet is readied in Pakistan, and some portion is readied in China”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Einar Tangen, a senior fellow at China’s Centre for International Governance Innovation (CIGI), told &lt;em&gt;BBC Urdu&lt;/em&gt; that “technology” involved in the jet was likely controlled by China. Therefore, any sale pact would be a joint agreement, with Beijing being a “senior partner”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“China might even increase Pakistan’s defence production, but all this will be in Beijing’s control,” the expert was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the air chiefs of Pakistan and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965452/procurement-of-jf-17-aircraft-comes-under-discussion-during-meeting-between-air-chief-bangladeshi-counterpart&quot;&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; held detailed discussions on the “potential procurement” of JF-17s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia’s Defence Minister Sjafrie Sjamsoeddin also visited Pakistan last week, holding meetings with the army chief and ACM Sindhu. The military’s media wing said that the minister expressed Jakarta’s desire to further expand defence ties with Islamabad.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh summons Myanmar envoy after border clashes</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966858/bangladesh-summons-myanmar-envoy-after-border-clashes</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh on Tuesday summoned the ambassador of Myanmar after civil war gun battles in the neighbouring country spilled over the border, wounding a Bangladeshi girl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy fighting in Myanmar’s Rakhine state this month has involved junta soldiers, Arakan Army fighters and Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) militia guerrillas. Authorities said around a dozen villages in Bangladesh’s Cox’s Bazar district have been affected by the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twelve-year-old Huzaifa Afnan was struck by a bullet, while a Bangladeshi fisherman had his leg ripped off after stepping on a landmine near the frontier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh reminded that the unprovoked firing towards Bangladesh is a blatant violation of international law and a hindrance to good neighbourly relations,” a foreign ministry press statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Myanmar’s ambassador to Bangladesh, U Kyaw Soe Moe, was summoned to the foreign ministry on Tuesday, where he expressed sincere sympathy to the injured victims and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My daughter was supposed to go to school, but she is on a ventilator,” Afnan’s father Jasim Uddin said. “My heart is bleeding for my baby girl.” More than a million Rohingya have fled their homes in Myanmar, many after a 2017 military crackdown, and now eke out a living in sprawling refugee camps just across the border in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ARSA, a Rohingya armed group formed to defend the persecuted Muslim minority, has been fighting the Myanmar military, as well as rival Arakan Army guerrillas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Bangladeshi border forces detained 53 ARSA fighters who had crossed the frontier.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladesh is experiencing a surge in political violence and killings as its 13th parliamentary election approaches. Rights groups report a significant increase in deaths linked to political rivalry and dominance struggles. In response, political figures are hiring gunmen, and the Jamaat-e-Islami chief is seeking support from retired military officers to ensure a &quot;fear-free&quot; election.</description>

      <title>In meeting with ICC, Bangladesh reiterates its refusal to travel to India for T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966750/in-meeting-with-icc-bangladesh-reiterates-its-refusal-to-travel-to-india-for-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s cricket board said on Tuesday it had repeated its refusal to travel to India for next month’s T20 World Cup during talks with the International Cricket Council (ICC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;announced &lt;/a&gt;on Jan 4 that it would not play its T20 World Cup matches in India after its player Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;released&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the two countries. Subsequently, Bangladesh &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;“formally requested”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the ICC to shift their games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Cup begins on February 7, with Bangladesh scheduled to play their four group matches in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, during a video conference with the ICC, the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) said it had “reiterated its request for the ICC to consider relocating Bangladesh’s matches outside India”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BCB reaffirmed its position regarding the decision not to travel to India, citing security concerns,” the board said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While the ICC highlighted that the tournament itinerary has already been announced and requested the BCB to reconsider its stance, the Board’s position remains unchanged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC has not commented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BCB said discussions with the ICC continue to “explore possible solutions”, it added, but that it “remains committed to safeguarding the well-being of its players, officials and staff”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh, led by Litton Das, are &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.icc-cricket.com/rankings/team-rankings/mens/t20i&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;placed ninth&lt;/a&gt; in the ICC T20 rankings. They have played all nine editions of the tournament, but have never qualified for the semi-finals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political ties between India and Bangladesh soured after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1847298&quot;&gt;mass uprising&lt;/a&gt; in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Mustafizur row: &apos;Position unchanged&apos; on India travel, B&apos;desh tells ICC; repeats &apos;security concerns&apos;</title>

      <description>Bangladesh Cricket Board reaffirmd its stance against traveling to India for the T20 World Cup 2026 due to security concerns, requesting matches be moved. The ICC has rejected these claims, urging Bangladesh to reconsider, but the BCB&apos;s position remains unchanged. Discussions are ongoing to find a resolution.</description>

      <description>Bangladesh&apos;s sports advisor claimed the nation would boycott the 2026 T20 World Cup in India, citing security concerns and an alleged ICC assessment. However, the ICC has firmly refuted these claims, stating their independent risk assessments found no specific threats and did not recommend squad changes or election postponements. Bangladesh&apos;s matches remain scheduled in India.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh standoff exposes ICC’s governance crisis ahead of T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966651/bangladesh-standoff-exposes-iccs-governance-crisis-ahead-of-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WITH less than three weeks to go before the T20 World Cup starts, the cricketing world looks on as the sport’s global governing body deals with yet another crisis. The latest, too, involves India — the country from where the International Cricket Council’s chairman and the CEO come from — naturally as the co-hosts of the 20-team showpiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh don’t want to play their matches in India and want them to be shifted to co-hosts Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things have come to this point after worsening political relations between the two countries over the last 12 months saw Bangladesh’s star pacer Mustafizur Rahman being withdrawn from Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders’ squad on the directives of the country’s cricket board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia cited “recent developments” as the reason for Mustafizur’s ouster. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) responded strongly, deciding not to play in India with security having become a major concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the BCB said on Wednesday that the “ICC has conveyed its willingness to work closely” with the board to resolve the issue, the latter itself has chosen to not comment on the issue with reports emerging on Monday that Chennai and Thirivananthapuram have been put forward as venue to host Bangladesh’s matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There also remains a possibility of Bangladesh not participating in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC, while trying to negotiate with the BCB, has not been able to show any kind of muscle as a governing body, especially against the host nation’s board for letting cricket be affected by politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This raises question marks over the ICC’s standing as a governing body in the face of India’s dominance via producing the major chunk of revenue that runs it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The body is led by Bharatiya Janata Party leader and India’s Home Minister Amit Shah’s son Jay, while ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta is also Indian. As former ICC president and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ehsan Mani views it, “the BCCI follows the political agenda of the BJP”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The ICC should have a clear policy of not allowing member countries’ politics to interfere with the game,” he told Dawn last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identifying the involvement of politics in the making of the decisions that run the sport as the most important concern, Mani claimed other strong cricket boards were not serious about taking it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, ECB [England and Wales Cricket Board] and CA [Cricket Australia] together with BCCI are not prepared to address this and other serious governance issues and together they have prevented ICC from carrying out a governance review which I was pushing for as chairman of PCB,” he said. “The ICC board is terribly conflicted, with each director looking after his country’s interest before considering what is good for the game as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mani said he expected the Bangladesh situation to be resolved through “a fudged solution, which will be engineered without addressing the governance failings of the ICC”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) chairman Dave Cameron, who served in the ICC’s Finance and Com­mercial Affairs committee between 2013-19, echoed Mani’s views, saying that the ICC needed to switch from being “a group of members” to becoming a proper governing body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Part of the challenge is that the ICC is not a governing council but is rather made up of countries that sit together as a members’ group, and this is unfortunate,” Cameron told Dawn. “As a governing council, there are some requirements, it’s not being used in that way, which is the detriment at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PAKISTAN’S OPPORTUNITY&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not the first time that security concerns triggered by political tensions between India and another country have come to put a tournament at risk. When India hosted the 50-over Cricket World Cup in 2023, the PCB was convinced days before the event to send the national team across the border. A stronger deadlock emerged ahead of last year’s Champions Trophy — of which the official hosts were Pakis­tan — with India refusing to return their neighbours’ 2023 gesture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC had to come up with a “hybrid model” to resolve the Champions Trophy matter and decided that Pakistan and India will play at neutral venues if the global tournament is being hosted by either of the two nations. That decision was hailed as Pakistan’s psychological win in the backdrop of the Indian financial and administrative muscle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the recent political shift in Bangladesh triggered by Sheikh Hasina’s ouster as the country’s prime minister and a consequential change of regime in the BCB, the PCB, led by Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, has got closer to the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi — also the Asian Cricket Council chief currently — and BCB president Aminul Islam were also reportedly at the forefront in making the 2025 Asia Cup happen amid calls for a boycott coming from India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former PCB chairman Najam Sethi, who himself has been in the midst of the Pakistan-India cricket issues during his previous tenure, the ongoing tensions are an opportunity for the PCB to form a pressure bloc within the ICC along with the BCB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Earlier, on any issue, Pakistan could not count on support from any ICC member if its stance differed from India’s, now it will have Bangladesh on its side,” Sethi told Dawn. “Their joint clout will be greater than the sum of their parts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan cricket leadership seemed to have sensed the opportunity after Mustafizur was snubbed by the BCCI as it the PCB announced zealously days after the fast bowler’s registration for the Pakistan Super League’s players’ draft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social media feeds on Sunday, meanwhile, carried unconfirmed reports of the PCB offering to host Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup matches in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“PCB and BCB should scratch each other’s shoulders in their respective leagues to cobble a common front against the rest of the Boards,” Sethi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Monday evening, BCCI secretary Saikia, as per reports, confirmed no communication was made by the ICC over a potential change of venues for the Bangladesh matches. Henceforth, as the clock ticked and the T20 World Cup neared, uncertainty prevailed and so did the ICC’s deafening silence.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>With the sleeves rolled up</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966713/with-the-sleeves-rolled-up</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE world is in ferment as the US lurches dangerously to the extreme right. Europe too has discarded a long cultivated democratic pretence and is eyeing its chance in the melee. Hungary, Poland, Austria and Italy have been singled out by Donald Trump’s strategists, according to their leaked documents, to subvert democracy for a right-wing takeover in Trump’s footsteps. British, French and German establishments are nudging their countries also towards militarism. EU is targeting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961041&quot;&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;, Palestine and Iran even as Nato looks poised to implode in the chaos of Trump’s claims over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966583/greenland-rejects-us-takeover-under-any-circumstance&quot;&gt;Greenland&lt;/a&gt;. The EU seeks to humour Trump over &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964877&quot;&gt;Venezuela&lt;/a&gt; while retaining a different yardstick to judge Vladimir Putin’s advances in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966294/unsc-calls-emergency-session-on-ukraine-tomorrow&quot;&gt;Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the masses are retaliating. Venezuela and Mexico are staging massive rallies with sleeves rolled up to combat Trump’s threat to them. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, sensing enough was enough of his neighbour, is mending his country’s ties with China. He could be visiting Beijing shortly to counter the ultimatums to Canada’s economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, this is the time for the left to be initiating and, where possible, spearheading mass movements against the rightward slide. Jeremy Corbyn recently unfurled the flag with a separate party to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1926419&quot;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; the British establishment, which includes his former Labour Party colleagues who he watched with dismay removing the last stitch of morality by abetting Benjamin Netanyahu’s genocide in Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;French left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon is leading a mass upsurge against Emmanuel Macron and the EU, accusing European leaders of “prostrate servility” to Trump. Mélenchon homed in on President Emmanuel Macron’s ideas on sending troops and long-range weapons to Ukraine. He demanded referendums in Donbass, Crimea and all contested regions because “it’s the people who decide” rather than warmongering elites who “don’t give a damn about people’s lives”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the time for the left to be initiating and, where possible, spearheading mass movements against the rightward slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The left in the US is punching above its weight to hold its ground, using every chink in Trump’s armour to put up a promising fight for democracy. In the absence of trustworthy support from the mainstream media, YouTube channels are abuzz with analysts and activists keeping Trump in their crosshairs. A white woman activist raging against MAGA’s nativism was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965792&quot;&gt;murdered&lt;/a&gt; by Trump’s hired guns from ICE. The killing in Minneapolis has set off a prairie fire across states. In the absence of vocal criticism of Trump from the Congress, the left, increasingly joined by Jewish students and senior scholars, is intervening strategically to ensure that Trump gets his comeuppance in the November mid-term polls and thereby can be reined in from doing further damage. Regardless of the outcome the left won’t be accused of sitting on its hands when America was dismembering democracy.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brazil and Colombia have slammed Trump’s abduction of a fellow Latin American president from his home in Caracas. Trump’s toolkit for Iran is different. A colour revolution is being quelled, says Pepe Escobar, a well-regarded Brazilian observer of the Middle East. Regardless of the images posted in Western media, Escobar says the Iranian leadership is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1966486&quot;&gt;braced&lt;/a&gt; for another round of war with US and Israel, only this time better prepared. It is a testament to the feckless ways of the left that a group like Mujahideen-i-Khalq, which was instrumental in deposing the Shah of Iran, has become a catspaw for Israeli and US intrusion in its own country. Veteran Iran watchers are sanguine that without the organisational skills and a well-oiled machinery of the deeply camouflaged Mujahideen-i-Khalq, Reza Pahlavi, the former crown prince would have no standing with the rioters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gulf has also been jolted by the events in Venezuela. “We are entering an era where international guarantees are fragile, institutions are weakened and power speaks louder than principle. Awareness today is not a luxury; it is a requirement for survival,” &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.arabnews.com/node/2628571&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cautioned&lt;/a&gt; Saudi Arabia’s &lt;em&gt;Arab News&lt;/em&gt;. It stressed that the seizure of Russian funds in Western banks was a betrayal of crucial trust that the world took for granted. “The lesson is clear. The time to act is now.” Interestingly, the writer in the Saudi paper is prominent UAE businessman Khalaf Ahmad Al-Habtoor. It says something for the thread that still unifies the two countries despite their recent aloofness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Asia is inevitably deeply affected by the turn of events unfolding at breakneck speed in the Middle East and in Latin America. Pakistan, currently in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962789&quot;&gt;good books&lt;/a&gt; of Trump (for no palpable reason), has spoken out boldly on the heist in Venezuela, with its defence minister reportedly calling for the abduction of Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu by the US (instead of Nicolás Maduro who should be freed). Bangladesh has witnessed street protests for Nicolás Maduro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, India, once a champion of lost causes in the Global South has been slow poisoned into becoming a basket case by its leaders seeking anchor in the West. When George W. Bush was in bad odour right across the world, a PEW survey said India was the rare country where Bush was popular. What does that say about the current leadership? Pulverised as a stag caught in the headlights of an approaching truck, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has left his foreign policy to the tender care of hope and prayer. What excites him, however, is any lurking campaign to win another state election, or even a municipal poll, preferably by communally polarising voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Modi’s calendar this year perhaps captures the essence of his preferences and fears. To cheer him, assembly polls are due in opposition-ruled West Bengal, Kerala and Tamil Nadu in May. On the other hand, he is to host the BRICS summit around August, which comes with the terror of having to take an unequivocal stand on Trump’s thuggery and India’s one-sided love with the US. In the meantime, China, Russia and Iran began a week of joint naval exercises in South Africa’s waters on Saturday. The ‘BRICS Plus operation’ would “ensure the safety of shipping and maritime economic activities”. The sleeves have been rolled up, mostly.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BD standoff exposes ICC’s governance crisis ahead of T20 World Cup</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1966651/bd-standoff-exposes-iccs-governance-crisis-ahead-of-t20-world-cup</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WITH less than three weeks to go before the T20 World Cup starts, the cricketing world looks on as the sport’s global governing body deals with yet another crisis. The latest, too, involves India — the country from where the International Cricket Council’s chairman and the CEO come from — naturally as the co-hosts of the 20-team showpiece.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh don’t want to play their matches in India and want them to be shifted to co-hosts Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things have come to this point after worsening political relations between the two countries over the last 12 months saw Bangladesh’s star pacer Mustafizur Rahman being withdrawn from Indian Premier League franchise Kolkata Knight Riders’ squad on the directives of the country’s cricket board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia cited “recent developments” as the reason for Mustafizur’s ouster. Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) responded strongly, deciding not to play in India with security having become a major concern.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the BCB said on Wednesday that the “ICC has conveyed its willingness to work closely” with the board to resolve the issue, the latter itself has chosen to not comment on the issue with reports emerging on Monday that Chennai and Thirivananthapuram have been put forward as venue to host Bangladesh’s matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There also remains a possibility of Bangladesh not participating in the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICC, while trying to negotiate with the BCB, has not been able to show any kind of muscle as a governing body, especially against the host nation’s board for letting cricket be affected by politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This raises question marks over the ICC’s standing as a governing body in the face of India’s dominance via producing the major chunk of revenue that runs it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The body is led by Bharatiya Janata Party leader and India’s Home Minister Amit Shah’s son Jay, while ICC CEO Sanjog Gupta is also Indian. As former ICC president and Pakistan Cricket Board chairman Ehsan Mani views it, “the BCCI follows the political agenda of the BJP”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The ICC should have a clear policy of not allowing member countries’ politics to interfere with the game,” he told Dawn last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Identifying the involvement of politics in the making of the decisions that run the sport as the most important concern, Mani claimed other strong cricket boards were not serious about taking it on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Unfortunately, ECB [England and Wales Cricket Board] and CA [Cricket Australia] together with BCCI are not prepared to address this and other serious governance issues and together they have prevented ICC from carrying out a governance review which I was pushing for as chairman of PCB,” he said. “The ICC board is terribly conflicted, with each director looking after his country’s interest before considering what is good for the game as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mani said he expected the Bangladesh situation to be resolved through “a fudged solution, which will be engineered without addressing the governance failings of the ICC”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former West Indies Cricket Board (WICB) chairman Dave Cameron, who served in the ICC’s Finance and Com­mercial Affairs committee between 2013-19, echoed Mani’s views, saying that the ICC needed to switch from being “a group of members” to becoming a proper governing body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Part of the challenge is that the ICC is not a governing council but is rather made up of countries that sit together as a members’ group, and this is unfortunate,” Cameron told Dawn. “As a governing council, there are some requirements, it’s not being used in that way, which is the detriment at this point.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PAKISTAN’S OPPORTUNITY&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not the first time that security concerns triggered by political tensions between India and another country have come to put a tournament at risk. When India hosted the 50-over Cricket World Cup in 2023, the PCB was convinced days before the event to send the national team across the border. A stronger deadlock emerged ahead of last year’s Champions Trophy — of which the official hosts were Pakis­tan — with India refusing to return their neighbours’ 2023 gesture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ICC had to come up with a “hybrid model” to resolve the Champions Trophy matter and decided that Pakistan and India will play at neutral venues if the global tournament is being hosted by either of the two nations. That decision was hailed as Pakistan’s psychological win in the backdrop of the Indian financial and administrative muscle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the recent political shift in Bangladesh triggered by Sheikh Hasina’s ouster as the country’s prime minister and a consequential change of regime in the BCB, the PCB, led by Pakistan interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, has got closer to the latter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naqvi — also the Asian Cricket Council chief currently — and BCB president Aminul Islam were also reportedly at the forefront in making the 2025 Asia Cup happen amid calls for a boycott coming from India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former PCB chairman Najam Sethi, who himself has been in the midst of the Pakistan-India cricket issues during his previous tenure, the ongoing tensions are an opportunity for the PCB to form a pressure bloc within the ICC along with the BCB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Earlier, on any issue, Pakistan could not count on support from any ICC member if its stance differed from India’s, now it will have Bangladesh on its side,” Sethi told Dawn. “Their joint clout will be greater than the sum of their parts.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan cricket leadership seemed to have sensed the opportunity after Mustafizur was snubbed by the BCCI as it the PCB announced zealously days after the fast bowler’s registration for the Pakistan Super League’s players’ draft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media feeds on Sunday, meanwhile, carried unconfirmed reports of the PCB offering to host Bangladesh’s T20 World Cup matches in Karachi, Lahore and Rawalpindi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“PCB and BCB should scratch each other’s shoulders in their respective leagues to cobble a common front against the rest of the Boards,” Sethi said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Monday evening, BCCI secretary Saikia, as per reports, confirmed no communication was made by the ICC over a potential change of venues for the Bangladesh matches. Henceforth, as the clock ticked and the T20 World Cup neared, uncertainty prevailed and so did the ICC’s deafening silence.&lt;/p&gt;
