      <title>Bangladesh will not play T20 World Cup matches in India, decision taken in context of BCCI’s ‘extreme communal policy’</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/bangladesh-will-not-play-t20-world-cup-matches-in-india-decision-taken-in-context-of-bccis-extreme-communal-policy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will not play their T20 World Cup matches in India after its cricketer Mustafizur Rahman was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; by his Indian Premier League (IPL) team amid growing tensions between the countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolkata Knight Riders said on Saturday they had released the Bangladesh bowler after being told to do so by India’s cricket board (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh are scheduled to play three T20 World Cup matches in Kolkata next month, with the February 7-March 8 tournament being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB), after an emergency meeting on Sunday, said it had “formally requested” the International Cricket Council (ICC) shift its team’s games to Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Board of Directors resolved that the Bangladesh National Team will not travel to India for the tournament under the current conditions,” a BCB statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said its decision was made due to “growing concerns regarding the safety and security” of its players, and based on its government’s advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In light of this decision, the BCB has formally requested the International Cricket Council (ICC), as the event authority, to consider relocating all of Bangladesh’s matches to a venue outside India.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the BCB’s emergency meeting, Youth and Sports Adviser Asif Nazrul said, “We welcome this decision taken in the context of the extreme communal policy of India’s cricket board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Nazrul had &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bssnews.net/news/347627&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;, “We will not accept any insult to Bangladeshi cricket, cricketers and Bangladesh under any circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The days of slavery are over,” he had said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he had ordered the BCB to inform the ICC that “where a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India despite being contracted, the entire Bangladeshi cricket team cannot feel safe going to play in the World Cup”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he would also ask that the IPL be blocked from Bangladeshi broadcasters. “I have requested the information and broadcasting adviser to stop the broadcasting of the IPL tournament in Bangladesh,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolkata Knight Riders, majority-owned by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, subsequently said that Mustafizur’s “release has been carried out following due process and consultations”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCB President Aminul Islam Bulbul told reporters late on Saturday: “The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developments come against the backdrop of soured political relations between India and Bangladesh after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;toppled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the ICC &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1880793&quot;&gt;allowed&lt;/a&gt; India to play Champions Trophy matches in the United Arab Emirates due to sour relations with hosts Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will also play all their matches of the T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka, as part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, cricket news site &lt;em&gt;Cricbuzz&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-news/137127/bcb-to-approach-icc-on-t20-wc-security-after-mustafizurs-ipl-omission-cricbuzzcom&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the BCB would ask the BCCI for a formal explanation regarding Mustafizur’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ICC did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;“Bangladesh will not go to India to play the World Cup. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has taken this decision today,” Nazrul, who is an adviser to the Ministry of Sports, said in a statement after an emergency meeting of the BCB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We welcome this decision taken in the context of the extreme communal policy of India’s cricket board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier, Nazrul had &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bssnews.net/news/347627&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;said,&lt;/a&gt; “We will not accept any insult to Bangladeshi cricket, cricketers and Bangladesh under any circumstances.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SMOKERS’ CORNER: THE MOB AND THE STATE</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964932/smokers-corner-the-mob-and-the-state</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;On December 18, 2025, a 25-year-old Hindu garment worker was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962420/massive-crowd-attends-funeral-of-bangladesh-student-leader#:~:text=the%20violence%20this%20week%20also%20saw%20a%20Hindu%20garment%20worker%20killed%20following%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy&quot;&gt;lynched&lt;/a&gt; by a mob of approximately 150 people in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district. Following accusations of blasphemy, the victim was beaten to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mob lynchings in Bangladesh, known locally as &lt;em&gt;gono-pituni&lt;/em&gt;, have a long history. But this crisis is not unique to Bangladesh. According to the Human Rights Watch’s &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.hrw.org/world-report/2025&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;World Report 2025&lt;/a&gt;, South Asia has emerged as a global epicentre for collective vigilantism, with similar violence frequently reported in India and Pakistan as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The recent surge in mob violence across India, Bangladesh and Pakistan is propelled by similar drivers: a decaying public confidence in the judiciary and the rapid spread of digital disinformation. This combination allows ‘street justice’ to effectively supersede state authority. As American political scientist Paul Staniland observed in a 2020 analysis for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, these patterns in South Asia are not recent developments. They are historical continuities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rooted in colonial-era structures and galvanised by the 1947 partition of India, this culture of vigilantism has simply been recalibrated for the digital age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From Bangladesh to India and Pakistan, lynchings have become a grim substitute for justice, but South Asia’s mobs are not simply spontaneous eruptions of rage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2017 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1326729&quot;&gt;lynching&lt;/a&gt; of university student Mashal Khan in Mardan, Pakistan, serves as a grim illustration of how false allegations (circulated on social media) are weaponised to orchestrate violence. Targeted by a campus mob under the guise of blasphemy, Mashal was brutally murdered, and his death was filmed by mobile phones and then uploaded on social media sites. The plan of the attack was hatched by university staff and Mashal’s political rivals who wanted to silence his criticism of administrative corruption in the university.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tragedy highlights a broader historical pattern in South Asia, where the mob has evolved into a calculated tool for political mobilisation and social policing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last century, the psychological mechanisms of ‘mob mentality’ have become deeply integrated into the region’s sociopolitical terrain. Mob mentality is driven by a psychological phenomenon known as ‘deindividuation’, where individuals lose their ‘sense of self’ and personal identity within a large group. When a person becomes part of an energised crowd, they often experience a feeling of anonymity. They believe they are indistinguishable from those around them and feel shielded from personal recognition or judgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the individual perceives their actions as being shared by the collective, the weight of personal accountability is diminished. Deindividuation often overrides a person’s moral compass, pushing individuals to engage in behaviours they are likely to find unthinkable if they were acting alone.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research suggests that individuals in ‘collectivist societies’, where group harmony is prioritised over individual identity, may be more susceptible to participate in or cheer mob violence. According to a 2023 study by Chinese researchers Jingjing Jio and Jun Zhao, people in collectivist cultures are conditioned from birth to subordinate their personal identity to the community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consequently, the transition from being an individual actor to becoming part of a collective mass is fluid, allowing personal moral standards to be easily overwhelmed by a crowd’s passions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what about China? It is a collectivist society, like most South Asian cultures. But mob violence in China is rare. While China saw significant mob activity in the 1960s and 1970s, the Chinese state (especially after 1989) has maintained a strict monopoly on force through its policy of ‘&lt;em&gt;weiwen&lt;/em&gt; [stability maintenance].’ Unauthorised gatherings, even if they are pro-government, are swiftly dismantled. All forms of mob action are perceived as a threat to the state’s authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The divergence between South Asia and China regarding mob violence lies in the nature of the ‘moral trigger.’ In South Asia, religious anxieties, such as allegations of blasphemy (Pakistan, Bangladesh) or disputes over cow slaughter (India), serve as ‘sacred’ justifications that allow a crowd to emotionally and morally bypass legal frameworks. In contrast, China’s secular and strictly regulated environment lacks these sacred pretexts, making it far more difficult to ignite the emotional frenzy required for a lynching.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/01/695984db0630f.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digital dynamics further separate these two regions. South Asia grapples with viral, unregulated disinformation that facilitates rapid mobilisation, whereas China’s heavily monitored digital space prevents the formation of frenzied mobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within China’s one-party system, capitalist growth has birthed a lifestyle individualism which, while not political, acts as a buffer against the more destructive elements of rigid groupthink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But capitalism in South Asia has not catalysed a similar shift toward individualism. Instead, economic power remains deeply intertwined with collectivist traditions. For example, business communities and traders often provide significant financial support to both mainstream and radical religious groups that are often at the forefront of fomenting mob violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This creates a feedback loop, where economic success reinforces traditional group identities rather than diluting them, maintaining the collective as the primary unit of social and political life. The Indian historian Meera Nanda has brilliantly investigated this in her book The God Market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Individualism functions as a psychological safeguard, anchoring the person to their internal moral convictions. By prioritising personal integrity over collective impulse, the individual becomes resilient to deindividuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While capitalism and individualism are historically symbiotic, this synergy faces resistance in South Asia, despite the expansion of capitalism in the region. Here, individualism is often stigmatised as a threat to communal harmony. Consequently, while Western discourse frames individuality/ self-reliance as a hallmark of ‘maturity’, South Asian cultural paradigms frequently interpret personal autonomy as a form of egoism or a betrayal of domestic duty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, as capitalism expands across South Asia, the burgeoning middle class is cultivating what the Indian psychologist Jai B. P. Sinha terms “localised individualism”. This model does not abandon communal ties but strategically renegotiates them, to serve personal and economic advancement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this shift is unlikely to curb the region’s propensity for mob violence nor neutralise the moral triggers behind lynchings. Rather than dismantling the moral narratives that incite such behaviour, South Asian middle classes have co-opted these narratives through populist movements, to protect their own socio-economic and political standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution requires a two-pronged approach: the cultivation of a more robust individualism and a decisive shift in state policy. The government must treat all mob activity as a direct challenge to state sovereignty and respond with appropriate force. Furthermore, the state must actively deconstruct and reframe the moral rationales that serve as triggers for collective violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, these remedies are more feasible in Pakistan’s pragmatic-centrist hybrid regime than in its neighbouring states. In India, a populist Hindu-nationalist government often relies on these very triggers for political mobilisation, while Bangladesh remains in a state of flux, struggling to navigate the volatile transition from autocracy to democracy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘Days of slavery are over’: Bangladesh to demand its T20 World Cup matches be moved outside India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053/days-of-slavery-are-over-bangladesh-to-demand-its-t20-world-cup-matches-be-moved-outside-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will request their matches at next month’s T20 World Cup be played in Sri Lanka, after India forced a Bangladeshi player to quit the Indian Premier League.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will not accept any insult to Bangladeshi cricket, cricketers and Bangladesh under any circumstances,” said Asif Nazrul, Youth and Sports Adviser in the interim government, in a &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.bssnews.net/news/347627&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; carried by the state-run &lt;em&gt;BSS&lt;/em&gt; news agency Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The days of slavery are over,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman was on Saturday &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; by the Kolkata Knight Riders after the Indian Premier League (IPL) team were “advised” by Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to do so, following tensions between the neighbouring nations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he had ordered the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) to write to the International Cricket Council (ICC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The board should inform that, where a Bangladeshi cricketer cannot play in India despite being contracted, the entire Bangladeshi cricket team cannot feel safe going to play in the World Cup,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have also instructed the board to request that Bangladesh’s World Cup matches should be held in Sri Lanka.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The T20 World Cup begins on February 7, co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh are scheduled to play their four group matches in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka, part of a deal that allows both India and Pakistan to play at neutral venues in multi-nation tournaments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political relations between India and Bangladesh soured after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina, a close ally of New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry last month condemned what it called “unremitting hostility against minorities” in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader, Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, has accused India of exaggerating the scale of the violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BCB president Aminul Islam Bulbul said the board will hold an emergency meeting later on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The dignity and security of our cricketers are our top priorities, and we will take a decision at the appropriate time keeping these in mind”, he told reporters late Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, who has previously played in the IPL for other teams, was snapped up at auction in December by Kolkata for more than $1 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But BCCI Secretary Devajit Saikia said that “considering recent developments”, Kolkata had been “advised to release” the 30-year-old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2026 IPL season begins on March 26.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nazrul said he would also ask that the IPL be blocked from Bangladeshi broadcasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have requested the Information and Broadcasting Adviser to stop the broadcasting of the IPL tournament in Bangladesh,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kolkata, majority-owned by Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan, subsequently said that Mustafizur’s “release has been carried out following due process and consultations”.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Mindless politicising of sport’: Tharoor slams Mustafizur Rahman’s IPL exit</title>

      <description>Sharing a video from Friday, Tharoor made his position clear on the issue. &quot;Recalling my views on the subject, now that BCCI has deplorably pulled the plug on Mustafizur Rahman,&quot; he said. He then questioned the logic behind the move, adding: &quot;And what if the Bangladeshi player in question had been Litton Das or Soumya Sarkar?&quot;</description>

      <title>BCCI instructs Kolkata Knight Riders to release Bangladesh’s Mustafizur after pressure from BJP</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964872/bcci-instructs-kolkata-knight-riders-to-release-bangladeshs-mustafizur-after-pressure-from-bjp</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Indian Premier League (IPL) team Kolkata Knight Riders have been told to release fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, the Board of Control for Cricket in India’s (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia said on Saturday, amid growing tensions between the countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development comes after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sangeet Som’s criticed Bollywood star Shahrukh Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise, calling Khan a traitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur’s selection to play for KKR had come amid allegations mostly by the Indian right-wing over attacks on Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month, hundreds protested near Bangladesh’s High Commission in New Delhi after Hindu factory worker Dipu Chandra Das was beaten and set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district by a crowd that accused him of making derogatory remarks about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A total of 12 people were arrested in connection with his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to recent developments going on all across, the BCCI has instructed the franchise Kolkata Knight Riders to release one of their players, Mustafizur Rahman of Bangladesh, from their squad,” Saikia &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://aninews.in/news/sports/cricket/kkr-confirms-exclusion-of-mustafizur-rahman-from-squad-after-bcci-directive20260103134705/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;told &lt;/a&gt;Indian news agency &lt;em&gt;ANI&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They can ask for a replacement if needed. And upon request, BCCI will allow a replacement player.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“BCCI will allow Kolkata Knight Riders a replacement player in line with IPL regulations, and further details will be communicated in due course,” the team added in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; has approached Mustafizur for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur, 30, has played for Sunrisers Hyderabad, Mumbai Indians, Rajasthan Royals, Chennai Super Kings and Delhi Capitals in previous seasons of the IPL, taking 65 wickets in 60 matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964862/shahrukh-khan-gets-flak-over-bangladesh-cricketer-in-kolkata-knight-riders&quot;&gt;signed by Kolkata&lt;/a&gt; in last month’s auction for a fee of 92 million Indian rupees ($1.02 million), making him the most expensive player from Bangladesh in IPL history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt;, opposition Congress party on Thursday condemned Som’s criticism of Khan for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While calling Khan a “gaddar” (traitor), former Uttar Pradesh MLA Som questioned him for investing money in a player “from a country working against India”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt; quoted from a video clip of him as saying: “The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite all this, traitors like Shahrukh Khan, I’m calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shahrukh that they will not succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incident worsened relations between India and its neighbour, with ties already strained after Bangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;fled to New Delhi&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1847298&quot;&gt;protests against her&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 19th edition of the IPL begins on March 26, after India and Sri Lanka co-host the Twenty20 World Cup starting in February.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Shahrukh Khan gets flak over Bangladesh cricketer in Kolkata Knight Riders</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964862/shahrukh-khan-gets-flak-over-bangladesh-cricketer-in-kolkata-knight-riders</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI: Political tensions between India and Bangladesh spilled into the cricket field after Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan recently inducted Bangladesh pacer Mustafizur Rahman into his Indian Premier League (IPL) team Kolkata Knight Riders and a Hindutva politician called him a traitor, reports said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt;, opposition Congress party on Thursday condemned Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Sangeet Som’s criticism of Shahrukh for inducting Mustafizur in his franchise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Uttar Pradesh MLA, Som targeted Shahrukh and called him a “gaddar” (traitor) for backing the decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not unusual for the popular actor, who happens to be a Muslim. In fact, the Muslim movie star triumvirate of Sharukh, Salman Khan and Amir Khan have all faced allegations that they were anti-Hindu, pro-Pakistan or whatever else BJP supporters choose to call them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even the late acting legend Dilip Kumar was also not spared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mustafizur controversy erupted following the IPL 2026 auction, where KKR secured “The Fizz” for a staggering Rs92 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the move was seen as a tactical masterstroke by cricket analysts, it also waded into a nationalistic backlash underway amid diplomatic tensions between India and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The controversy over Mustafizur being in Shahrukh’s team is nicely timed with domestic election season in West Bengal where the BJP is threatening to topple secular Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee in polls due by mid-year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mustafizur’s selection to play for KKR has come amid allegations mostly by the Indian right-wing over attacks on Hindus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While calling Shahrukh a traitor, Som questioned him for investing money in a player “from a country working against India”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Hindustan Times&lt;/em&gt; quoted from a video clip of him as saying: “The way Hindus are being persecuted in Bangladesh, women and girls are being raped, their homes are being burned, and anti-India slogans are being chanted there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite all this, traitors like Shahrukh Khan, I’m calling him a traitor because everything he has is given by India, given by the people of India, but where do they invest this money? They invest it in players from a country that is working against India. I want to tell people like Shahrukh that they will not succeed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress MP Manickam Tagore, strongly condemning the ‘traitor’ remarks, called the comments an “attack on India’s pluralism” while saying that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) should stop “poisoning society”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Som was adamant. “Rahman won’t be able to step outside the airport,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>South Asia&amp;#039;s Youth Bulge Risks Becoming Long-Term Liability</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/south-asias-youth-bulge-risks-becoming-long-term-liability</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;South Asia’s unemployment challenge is unfolding differently across different regional countries, yet driven by almost similar structural failures. India’s scale magnifies the risks of jobless growth; Pakistan’s instability deepens youth disillusionment; Sri Lanka’s educated unemployment reflects long-standing policy neglect; and Bangladesh’s export-led success masks limited employment diversification. Unless these states move beyond fragmented schemes and adopt employment-centred growth, skill-linked education, and gender-inclusive labour reforms, the region’s youthful population will shift from being a potential dividend to a shared strategic vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Ex-information secretary Ambreen Jan selected to head Pemra</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964676/ex-information-secretary-ambreen-jan-selected-to-head-pemra</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ambreen Jan, former information secretary, was selected on Friday as the new chairperson of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra), which will make her the first female head of the electronic media regulator once her appointment is confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The previous head of the regulator, Mohammad Saleem Baig, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1410839&quot;&gt;appointed&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 and retired last year, leaving the post vacant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A meeting of a parliamentary committee, chaired by Shehbaz Babar, selected Jan after it was convened to appoint the next head of the influential media regulatory authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the committee’s unanimous approval, Jan’s name was forwarded to President Asif Ali Zardari for final confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A former Grade 22 officer, Jan has also previously served as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1882974/?utm_source=newskit_ai&quot;&gt;managing director&lt;/a&gt; of the state broadcaster &lt;em&gt;PTV,&lt;/em&gt; the director general of &lt;em&gt;Radio Pakistan&lt;/em&gt; and press counsellor to Bangladesh while relations were strained from 2011 to 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was among five shortlisted candidates considered for the post, including Brigadier (retd.) Anwar Ahmed, Mateen Haider, Irfan Ashraf, and Dr Hamid Khan.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>India to tour Bangladesh for white-ball matches in September</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964679/india-to-tour-bangladesh-for-white-ball-matches-in-september</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;India’s postponed six-match white-ball cricket tour of Bangladesh will take place in September, Bangladesh’s Cricket Board said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series, including three one-day and three T20 matches, originally due to be played in August 2025, was delayed after both countries’ boards “mutually agreed to defer” the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India will now play three ODIs and three T20s between September 1 to 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The postponement last year came as political relations between India and neighbouring Bangladesh turned frosty, after a mass uprising in Dhaka in 2024 toppled then prime minister Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina fled to India, where she has remained, straining relations between Dhaka and New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh has repeatedly requested Hasina’s extradition. She was sentenced to death in absentia in November for orchestrating a deadly crackdown on the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But New Delhi is also closely watching the upcoming elections on February 12, the first vote in the South Asian nation of 170 million people since the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, India’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar visited Bangladesh to attend the funeral of former leader Khaleda Zia, the most senior visit by an Indian official since the overthrow of Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) is widely seen as a frontrunner in elections, and her son Tarique Rahman, who returned last month after 17 years in exile, is seen as a potential prime minister if it wins a majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will also host series against Pakistan, New Zealand, Australia and the West Indies, across all three formats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>‘Spectrum-starved country’: IT minister says govt to auction 600 MHz spectrum next month</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964674/spectrum-starved-country-it-minister-says-govt-to-auction-600-mhz-spectrum-next-month</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Federal Minister for IT and Telecommunications Shaza Fatima Khawaja announced on Friday that Pakistan would auction the 600 megahertz (MHz) spectrum next month to provide better internet speeds and roll out 5G in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a meeting last week, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962943&quot;&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the process of auctioning the 600 MHz spectrum within two months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The spectrum available for our telecom industry is extremely limited,” said the minister while addressing the media in Islamabad, and added that telcos “provide services in the country using just the 274 MHz”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a spectrum-starved country,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are a country of 240 million people with only 274 MHz of spectrum,” she stated, adding that “Bangladesh, with about two-thirds of Pakistan’s population, provides 600 MHz.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spectrum is the range of radio frequencies that carries wireless signals for mobile phones, the internet, TV, and radio. Mobile networks like 3G, 4G, and 5G operate by sending data over specific frequency bands within this spectrum. In South Asia, Bangladesh, India, Bhutan, the Maldives, and Sri Lanka have launched 5G networks nationwide, while Pakistan, Nepal, and Afghanistan have yet to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal minister maintained that spectrum availability in Pakistan was the lowest in the region due to the absence of any major spectrum auction for many years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It will not only improve our 3G and 4G services, but also introduce 5G in Pakistan for the first time,” she elaborated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal minister emphasised that the internet was “critical infrastructure,” like roads used to be in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The internet plays a crucial role in the development of the social sector, large-scale economic policies, and national and personal security. Without this [600MHz] level of connectivity, we cannot move forward,” she maintained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The IT minister said that it is vital to perceive the internet and connectivity as an “enabling tool” that will unlock the country’s “ economic potential and create employment”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, during a press conference alongside the finance minister, Khawaja said that the government was trying to ensure that the auction is completed by the end of January or early February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The federal minister said that in the auction, additional bands were being offered in Pakistan for the first time, which would not only improve 3G and 4G quality but also ensure the rollout of 5G services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She stressed that the internet was integral to the government’s digitisation efforts as part of the Digital Nation Pakistan Act, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, the consultant for the 5G spectrum auction &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955349&quot;&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; its report to the government, which had remained stalled due to the merger of PTCL and Telenor and litigation over the 2600 MHz band.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report, prepared by US-based consultancy firm National Economic Research Associates (NERA), noted that Pakistan was offering 606MHz of new spectrum across six major bands: 700MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz, 2600MHz and 3500MHz. The 2600MHz band was considered the most suitable for 5G.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>From the rift with the U.S. to a slow rapprochement with China, but reduced ties with Russia. From the new normal in conflict with Pakistan and spiralling ties with Bangladesh, to closer bonds with the Taliban in Afghanistan — 2025 was India’s most challenging year in foreign policy. Will 2026 provide a reprieve?</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;India today sits at the bottom of the rank of countries in the Environmental Performance Index (EPI), which combines a range of indicators like climate change mitigation, air pollution, waste management, sustainability of fisheries and agriculture, deforestation, and biodiversity protection. The EPI is produced by centres working under Yale and Columbia universities. The 2024 listing showed India at rank 176 out of 180, just ahead of Pakistan (rank 179) but behind Bangladesh (175), China (156), and Sri Lanka (134).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Just a handshake</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964530/just-a-handshake</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;IT was a handshake that sent a ripple through the region. On Wednesday, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and India’s External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964291&quot;&gt;shook hands in Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;, where they had both arrived to attend the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964271&quot;&gt;state funeral of former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;passed away &lt;/a&gt;earlier this week. It was, doubtless, a significant moment which invited attention across three countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chief Adviser of the Government of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/ChiefAdviserGoB/status/2006340330585833665&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;made note of it in a post on his X account&lt;/a&gt;, which stated that the two men had “exchanged greetings” during their interaction ahead of the funeral programme organised for Ms Zia. Pictures of the two, sombrely attired for the occasion, accompanied his post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian media downplayed the event, framing the handshake as a usual nicety at such events and therefore inconsequential. The Pakistani media, noting that it was the first high-level contact between the two nations since the May hostilities, ran with the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://x.com/NAofPakistan/status/2006331508479664546&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statement issued by the National Assembly Secretariat&lt;/a&gt;, underlining the part where it claimed that the handshake and pleasantries had been initiated by Mr Jaishankar, who reportedly approached Mr Sadiq with an informal acknowledgement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One reason for the interest could be that this is a slow time of the year for newsrooms. Another could be that anticipation has continuously been high for what happens next between Pakistan and India. Yet, given the prevailing atmosphere, not much can or should be read into a mere handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the NA Secretariat’s statement on the ‘handshake’ notes that Pakistan has “consistently emphasised dialogue, restraint and cooperative measures, including proposals for peace talks and joint investigations into the alleged false flag Pahalgam incident, in order to prevent unprovoked aggression and escalation”. Can this be read as a signal to New Delhi that the door to talks remains open?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the hostile rhetoric and posturing from next door show no signs of relenting. Recent reports regarding plans for controversial hydropower projects by India, which would violate the Indus Waters Treaty, are designed to be provocations for further tensions between the two states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is, without question, a strong need for temperatures to be brought down. But handshakes and exchanging pleasantries alone will not make that happen. It will require earnest effort, especially on New Delhi’s part, and diplomacy at the highest levels before a thaw can be expected.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-subhead&quot;&gt;The European Court of Human Rights issued a new challenge against the UK&apos;s decision to strip Begum of her citizenship amid concerns she was groomed and trafficked into Syria&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-cutline&quot;&gt;A source told the BBC that British Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood will prioritise national security and not restore Shamima Begum&apos;s UK citizenship (AFP)&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A government source told the BBC that Mahmood will defend the decision to strip &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-supreme-court-refuse-hear-shamima-begum-appeal&quot;&gt;Shamima Begum&lt;/a&gt; of her citizenship after the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) asked the Home Office whether ministers considered Begum was a victim of trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The home secretary will robustly defend the decision to revoke Shamima Begum’s citizenship, which has been tested and upheld time and again in our domestic courts,” said the source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The home secretary will always put this country’s national security first.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last December, the Strasbourg court &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/shamima-begum-uk-citizenship-european-court-human-rights-challenges-uk-government-citizenship-stripping&quot;&gt;sent a series of questions &lt;/a&gt;to the UK government, asking whether it broke anti-trafficking obligations when it stripped Begum of her citizenship in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions include whether the government violated Article 4 of the European Convention of Human Rights, which prohibits slavery, servitude and forced labour, as well as a state’s duty to prevent and investigate trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Former Northern Ireland lord chief justice says UK wrong to strip Shamima Begum of citizenship&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/former-northern-irish-lord-chief-justice-says-uk-wrong-strip-shamima-begum-citizenship&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped Begum of her citizenship on national security grounds after his office argued that the deprivation was “conducive to the public good” and she posed a threat to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javid also justified the decision to strip her British citizenship on the grounds that Begum qualified for a Bangladeshi passport because of her parents’ heritage, despite never visiting or living in the South Asian country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begum made headlines when she fled to Syria in 2015 to join IS with two school friends from her East London home. She then reappeared four years later, at an advanced stage of pregnancy, after journalists tracked her down in IS territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Begum has tried multiple times, in a series of legal battles with the UK government, to regain her British citizenship, none of which have succeeded, while being held in a prison camp in northern Syria controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECHR is now assessing whether the Home Office failed to take into account whether she was a victim of trafficking, and if removing her citizenship could have prevented the government from fulfilling its duty to investigate how she was allowed to leave the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&apos;Catalogue of failures&apos;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their application to the Strasbourg court, Begum’s lawyers said the decision violated Article 4 of the ECHR and that the UK authorities failed to ask four questions before depriving her of her citizenship: whether she had been trafficked to Syria; whether British authorities failed to protect her; whether her deprivation of citizenship would undermine any future investigation into potential trafficking; and, if trafficking issues were present, whether deprivation could be justified on national-security grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birnberg Peirce, the law firm that is representing Begum, described the ECHR’s intervention as an “unprecedented opportunity” for the UK government to assess whether previous administrations ignored or sidestepped the considerations to be taken into account to strip her of her citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Strasbourg’s communication presents an unprecedented opportunity for the UK as well as for Ms Begum to grapple with the significant considerations raised in her case and ignored, sidestepped or violated up to now by previous UK administrations,” said&amp;nbsp;lawyer&amp;nbsp;Gareth Peirce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is impossible to dispute that a 15-year-old British child was in 2014/15 lured, encouraged and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to ISIL-controlled territory for the known purpose of being given, as a child, to an ISIL fighter to propagate children for the Islamic State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The police failed to warn families, informed the school that its apprehension of risk was overstated, conducted no safeguarding measures, delayed contact with ports and known routes of travel to trigger alarms and prevent [them] reaching the known destination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, Declan Morgan, the former lord chief justice of Northern Ireland, said Britain&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/former-northern-irish-lord-chief-justice-says-uk-wrong-strip-shamima-begum-citizenship&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;should not have stripped&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;Begum of her citizenship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan, who serves as a a supplementary panel member of the UK Supreme Court, made the remarks&amp;nbsp; at the launch of a new&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/sweeping-uk-terror-law-label-harmful-behaviour-terrorism-prevent-overhaul&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by the Independent Commission on UK Counter-Terrorism Law, Policy and Practice, which he chairs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Special Immigration Appeals Court (SIAC) found that conditions in the prison camp where Begum is being arbitrarily detained without trial constituted inhuman and degrading treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years later, SIAC also found that the state failed to protect her but noted that its “hands were tied” as a result of the Supreme Court’s limiting the immigration court’s ability to take into consideration the merits of Begum’s case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECHR’s intervention comes as activists ramp up their campaigning against the UK’s growing use of citizenship-stripping powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final judgement is expected at a later date, following submissions from the UK government and Begum’s lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NA Speaker Sadiq, Indian FM Jaishankar shake hands in Dhaka in first high-level contact since May conflict</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964291/na-speaker-sadiq-indian-fm-jaishankar-shake-hands-in-dhaka-in-first-high-level-contact-since-may-conflict</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Speaker of the National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar shook hands in Dhaka on Wednesday, marking the first high-level contact between Pakistani and Indian officials since the military conflict in May of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations between Islamabad and New Delhi reached their lowest point this year following an attack in Pahalagam, in Indian-occupied Kashmir. India blamed Pakistan, while Islamabad denied any connection and offered — and continues to offer — an independent probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A press release from the NA Secretariat stated that during Sadiq’s visit to Dhaka for former Bangladeshi prime minister Khaleda Zia’s funeral, Jaishankar approached him for a handshake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Indian External Minister Dr S Jaishankar approached the Speaker [of the] National Assembly and shaked hands,” the press release read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During this interaction, Dr S Jaishankar introduced himself to the speaker and told the speaker that he had recognised him [&lt;em&gt;sic&lt;/em&gt;].”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/NAofPakistan/status/2006331508479664546&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The press release added that since the Pahalgam attack, Pakistan has “consistently emphasised dialogue, restraint and cooperative measures, including proposals for peace talks and joint investigations into the alleged false flag Pahalgam incident, in order to prevent unprovoked aggression and escalation“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the Pahalgam incident, India took a raft of unilateral diplomatic measures against Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the Indian measures, the suspension of the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTs/Volume%20419/volume-419-I-6032-English.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Indus Waters Treaty&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (IWT) stood out as the most severe. The 1960 pact, brokered by the World Bank, has endured through wars and decades of hostility. Its suspension, therefore, marked a watershed moment in the already fraught relationship between the nuclear-armed neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India further lowered diplomatic ties by closing down the main border transit point, framing the attack as a grave provocation that warranted significant diplomatic, economic, and logistical pressure on Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan called for an independent and transparent investigation into the attack, strongly denying India’s accusations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, New Delhi launched &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909295&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;deadly air strikes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Punjab and Azad Kashmir on May 7, marking the beginning of a four-day clash between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. After &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;tit-for-tat strikes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on each other’s airbases by the two sides, it took American intervention on May 10 for both sides to finally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186/pakistan-rattles-india-with-firm-response-as-patience-runs-out&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reach a ceasefire&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) — an organisation that provides a framework for international disputes — &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1920611&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;issued&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; a Supplemental Award of Competence, stating that India cannot unilaterally hold the IWT in abeyance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had sounded the alarm on New Delhi’s “weaponisation of water” following abrupt &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961827&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;variations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the flow of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers, which caused consternation among farmers in Punjab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had noted that the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) had also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1920727&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reaffirmed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the continued validity of the treaty and its dispute-resolution mechanisms. In addition, he cited concerns expressed by UN rapporteurs over India’s actions in connection with the treaty.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh mourns ex-PM Khaleda Zia with state funeral</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964271/bangladesh-mourns-ex-pm-khaleda-zia-with-state-funeral</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh bade farewell on Wednesday to former prime minister Khaleda Zia in a state funeral drawing vast crowds, mourning a towering leader whose career defined politics for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda, the first woman to serve as prime minister in the South Asian nation of 170 million people,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt; died&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday aged 80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flags were flown at half-mast, and thousands of security officers lined the streets as her body was carried through the streets of the capital Dhaka in a vehicle in the colours of the national flag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large crowds had gathered outside parliament — many waving national flags or those of Khaleda’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — where the funeral prayers were &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/passing-khaleda-zia/news/khaleda-zias-body-taken-gulshan-flag-draped-vehicle-4069821&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;held&lt;/a&gt; at around 3pm local time, according to Dhaka-based &lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChiefAdviserGoB/status/2006315795283083711&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda was laid to rest alongside her late husband, Ziaur Rahman, who was assassinated in 1981 during his time as president. The burial took place at around 4:30pm local time, &lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventy-year-old retired government official Minhaz Uddin, who was attending Khaleda’s funeral, said he had never voted for her, but came to honour the three-time prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I came here with my grandson, just to say goodbye to a veteran politician whose contributions will always be remembered,” he said, watching from behind a barbed wire barricade as her body passed by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Khaleda Zia has been an inspiration,” mourner Sharmina Siraj told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;, adding that “it is difficult to imagine women in leadership positions anytime soon”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 40-year-old mother of two said stipends introduced by Khaleda to support girls’ education “had a huge impact on the lives of our girls”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#na-speaker-meets-family-expresses-condolences&quot; id=&quot;na-speaker-meets-family-expresses-condolences&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;NA speaker meets family, expresses condolences&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, who is in Bangladesh for the funeral, visited the residence of the former Bangladeshi prime minister, where he met her son and daughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a statement issued by the NA Secretariat, Sadiq expressed his condolences at the passing of their mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In this hour of grief and sorrow, the government and the people of Pakistan stand with you,” he was quoted as saying. The family of the late premier thanked Sadiq for his condolences.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NA speaker also met the country’s national security adviser, Khalilur Rehman, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said that Sadiq “conveyed a message of sympathy and condolences on behalf of the residents and prime minister of Pakistan”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker also met the adviser for law, justice and parliamentary affairs of Bangladesh, Asif Nazrul, where the two discussed matters of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, a post on the NA‘s X account said Sadiq also had an interaction with Indian Foreign Minister Dr S, Jaishankar at Bangladesh’s parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#legacy-lives-on&quot; id=&quot;legacy-lives-on&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Legacy lives on’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1959216&quot;&gt;ill health&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1388124&quot;&gt; imprisonment&lt;/a&gt;, Khaleda had vowed to campaign in elections set for 12 February — the first vote since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party is widely seen as a frontrunner, and her son Tarique Rahman, 60, who returned only last week after 17 years in exile, is seen as a potential prime minister if they win a majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She is no more, but her legacy lives on — and so does the BNP,” said Jenny Parvez, 37, who travelled for several hours with her family to watch the funeral cortege pass her on the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interim government, led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, declared three days of national mourning and an elaborate state funeral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus said Bangladesh had “lost a great guardian”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#unbreakable&quot; id=&quot;unbreakable&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Unbreakable’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarique Rahman said in a statement that “the country mourns the loss of a guiding presence that shaped its democratic aspirations”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His mother, he added, “endured repeated arrests, denial of medical care, and relentless persecution”, but that “her resilience … was unbreakable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffering from a raft of health issues, Khaleda was rushed to hospital in late November, where her condition had gradually deteriorated despite treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, hours before her death, party workers had on Monday submitted nomination papers on her behalf for three constituencies for next year’s polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he hoped Khaleda’s “vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership”, a warm message despite the strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka since Hasina’s fall.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>2025 — Pakistan’s year of water wars</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963930/2025-pakistans-year-of-water-wars</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will remember 2025 for a couple of reasons. One, and most pivotal of them, is water, and not because of a single catastrophic event, but because multiple hydrological, political, and climatic crises converged simultaneously, dismantling the long-held assumption that water management is merely a technical or seasonal concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout the year, water moved decisively into the realm of national security, federal cohesion, public health, and regional diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan entered 2025 with a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1886804&quot;&gt;drier-than-average winter&lt;/a&gt;, slid rapidly into one of the most severe heatwave seasons on record, endured compound monsoon disasters, and concluded the year facing unprecedented transboundary water hostility on both its eastern and western borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The challenges, however, were not just external. Internally, long-standing inter-provincial distrust over water allocation erupted into mass protests, as Sindh confronted an existential crisis spanning agriculture, access to drinking water, coastal survival, and deteriorating infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below, we take a closer look at all that unfolded this year to make 2025 a turning point in Pakistan’s water history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#transboundary-hydropolitics&quot; id=&quot;transboundary-hydropolitics&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Transboundary hydropolitics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Indus Waters Treaty shock&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historically, the Indus Water Treaty, forged by an unlikely alliance of world powers in 1960, withstood over six decades, survived wars, and braved diplomatic crises, serving as a stunning example of international cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that, however, collapsed in 2025, when on April 23, India formally &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1906075&quot;&gt;placed the treaty in abeyance&lt;/a&gt; following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source&quot;&gt;Pahalgam attack&lt;/a&gt;. The immediate consequence was not the physical diversion of river flows, but the suspension of hydrological data sharing, which is an essential pillar for flood forecasting, reservoir operations, and irrigation planning in downstream Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The loss of advanced flow information during an exceptionally volatile monsoon season sharply increased downstream flood risk and operational uncertainty. Although Pakistan managed information through alternative national and international sources, India’s posture in water diplomacy appeared increasingly irresponsible, signalling an attempt to weaponise water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weaponisation of water and consistent threats were met with an appropriate and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1953682&quot;&gt;timely response &lt;/a&gt;from Pakistan, which involved declaring any unilateral diversion of western rivers an act of war and marking an unprecedented securitisation of water. Although international arbitration processes continued and interpretative rulings were issued later in the year, the treaty’s normative authority was thoroughly weakened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The western frontier: Afghanistan and the Kunar River&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While attention remained fixed on India, a quieter but equally destabilising hydrological threat emerged on Pakistan’s western frontier. In October 2025, the Taliban administration &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1950983&quot;&gt;ordered &lt;/a&gt;the immediate construction of a major dam on the Kunar River, a tributary that provides the bulk of the flow to the Kabul River system, sustaining large parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of a formal water-sharing treaty between Pakistan and Afghanistan, bilateral water relations rely on customary practices that are now under visible strain. Few voices in Pakistan called for the counter-diversion of the Chitral River, signalling how water infrastructure has begun to function as a strategic instrument in an increasingly volatile regional landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#inter-provincial-water-governance&quot; id=&quot;inter-provincial-water-governance&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Inter-provincial water governance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Domestically, 2025 exposed the fragility of Pakistan’s federal water compact. The launch of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1892713&quot;&gt;Green Pakistan Initiative&lt;/a&gt;, aimed at converting millions of acres of land into corporate farmland through new irrigation canals, triggered the most intense inter-provincial water conflict in decades. The proposed Cholistan Canal became the central flashpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sindh’s opposition was grounded in hydrological reality: there is no demonstrable surplus water in the Indus system capable of sustaining new large-scale irrigation without reducing downstream flows. Political leaders, farmers, lawyers, and civil society framed the project as a violation of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1922326&quot;&gt;1991 Water Apportionment Accord&lt;/a&gt; and a direct threat to Sindh’s agriculture and the already collapsing Indus Delta.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mass protests, highway blockades, and resolutions passed in the Sindh Assembly reflected a rare province-wide consensus that upstream water diversion had become an existential issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with escalating unrest, the federal government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1906331&quot;&gt;halted &lt;/a&gt;canal construction in late April, a decision later formalised by the Council of Common Interests (CCI). The body returned provisional approvals and directed that no new canal could proceed without full provincial consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this intervention reaffirmed constitutional federalism, it did not eliminate underlying structural tensions. Corporate agriculture remains a federal priority, while inter-provincial trust remains deeply eroded. Even technically successful reservoir management later in the year could not fully restore confidence in allocation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#from-climatic-extremes-to-systemic-failures&quot; id=&quot;from-climatic-extremes-to-systemic-failures&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;From climatic extremes to systemic failures&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1944130&quot;&gt;came the floods&lt;/a&gt;, one of the most consequential hydrological events since 2022, not because of the physical damage they caused but because they exposed systematic failures in water governance, infrastructure planning, and disaster preparedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike a single flood pulse, 2025 witnessed a sequence of high-intensity rainfall events, sudden upstream releases, massive landslides and urban drainage collapse, producing cascading flood risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The monsoon began earlier than average in late June and extended deep into September, marked by intense cloudburst events. On July 17, Rawalpindi received approximately &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1924943&quot;&gt;230 millimetres of rainfall&lt;/a&gt; within 24 hours, overwhelming drainage systems and inundating urban settlements. Similar &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1938525&quot;&gt;flash flooding occurred across KP and northern Punjab&lt;/a&gt;, where steep catchments rapidly converted rainfall into destructive flows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Riverine flooding followed as exceptional rainfall in the upper Indus Basin coincided with reduced predictability in upstream releases. In late August, sudden discharges — particularly on the Ravi, Sutlej, and Chenab rivers — combined with local rainfall to inundate large tracts of Punjab. Satellite analysis later confirmed that more than &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1940647&quot;&gt;1.3 million hectares of farmland were submerged&lt;/a&gt;, severely damaging rice, cotton, and sugarcane crops.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; This aerial view shows partially submerged residential buildings following the overflowing of the Ravi River in Lahore on August 30, 2025. &amp;mdash; AFP &quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/311129000f52d5d.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;This aerial view shows partially submerged residential buildings following the overflowing of the Ravi River in Lahore on August 30, 2025. — AFP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sindh, on the other hand, experienced a different flood dynamic. After entering the year under drought conditions, the province faced rapid &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942352&quot;&gt;river swelling at Guddu and Sukkur barrages&lt;/a&gt;. Emergency discharges forced evacuations of around 150,000 people from vulnerable riverine areas, illustrating the absence of adaptive operational management under extreme variability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nationwide, the floods claimed over 1,000 lives, displaced more than six million people, and damaged critical infrastructure. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1944130&quot;&gt;economic impact &lt;/a&gt;was severe, with flood-related disruptions shaving an estimated 0.5 per cent off national GDP. Beyond immediate destruction, floodwaters mobilised sewage, industrial effluents, and agro-chemicals, contaminating drinking water sources and triggering post-flood disease outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overarching lesson was stark: floods in Pakistan are no longer episodic natural disasters but systemic stress tests, exposing the same governance failures with increasing intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#droughts-to-floods&quot; id=&quot;droughts-to-floods&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Droughts to floods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sindh embodied the contradictions of 2025 more acutely than any other province. Early &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1898669&quot;&gt;Kharif water shortages&lt;/a&gt;, now a recurring feature, once again reduced cotton sowing and devastated mango orchards at critical growth stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the year progressed, the irrigation crisis morphed into a public health emergency. In rural areas, women and children travelled long distances to collect saline and contaminated water. In cities, reliance on water tankers surged beyond affordability. Only about a quarter of Sindh’s population had access to safely managed drinking water, while water-borne diseases increased silently.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; Women clear wastage from cotton fibers in Kabirwala, Pakistan September 18, 2025. &amp;mdash; Reuters &quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/31113631dac8a65.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Women clear wastage from cotton fibers in Kabirwala, Pakistan September 18, 2025. — Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the Indus Delta continued its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1895480&quot;&gt;slow collapse&lt;/a&gt;. Insufficient freshwater flows below Kotri accelerated seawater intrusion, rendering fertile land unproductive and displacing more than 1.2 million people over the past two decades. Mangrove loss, collapse of fisheries, and salinisation transformed large areas into ecological dead zones, fuelling migration toward already overstressed cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It increasingly appears that the delta no longer belongs to anyone. Even in 2025, when relatively improved flows reached the delta, voices emerged claiming that water had been “wasted” by flowing to the sea — an outlook that is anti-river, anti-resilience, anti-sustainability, and ultimately anti-people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, investigations into &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1843096&quot;&gt;Sukkur Barrage gate failures &lt;/a&gt;exposed years of deferred maintenance. Fortunately, a major &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962471&quot;&gt;rehabilitation and modernisation project&lt;/a&gt; was already underway. Even with the progress in 2025, the system remains under significant stress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Karachi, the K-IV project reached only 64pc completion despite massive expenditure, while demand continued to exceed supply by nearly 550 MGD. Moreover,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1916618&quot;&gt; serious questions remain&lt;/a&gt; about whether the project’s design and execution will translate into the intended outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#the-question-of-water-governance&quot; id=&quot;the-question-of-water-governance&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The question of water governance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.adb.org/awdo/editions/2025&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Asian Water Development Outlook&lt;/a&gt; (AWDO), released by the Asian Development Bank, brought yet another water reality to the fore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report placed Pakistan near the bottom of regional water security rankings, underscoring that the country’s water crisis stems less from absolute scarcity and more from persistent governance failure. Assessing 50 economies across rural, urban, economic, environmental, and disaster dimensions, the document showed that Pakistan’s National Water Security Index improved by only 6.4 points between 2013 and 2025 — below the regional average and far behind neighbours such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rural water security remains in the second-lowest tier, marked by poor water quality, limited piped supply, sanitation deficits, and a high burden of water-borne disease, reflecting weak integration of WASH into climate adaptation.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban water security is even more alarming: despite marginal gains, Pakistan’s urban drainage score fell to zero, highlighting chronic flooding, unplanned expansion, and infrastructural decay, exemplified by Karachi’s persistent supply deficits and informal tanker economy. Economic water security stagnated, while environmental water security deteriorated most visibly in the shrinking Indus Delta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taken together, these findings reinforce the central lesson of 2025: Pakistan’s water crisis is no longer defined by scarcity alone, but by the growing unsafety of its water and the inequitable, opaque systems through which it is governed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#10-imperatives-for-2026&quot; id=&quot;10-imperatives-for-2026&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;10 imperatives for 2026&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lived experience of 2025 leaves little room for ambiguity and yields ten unavoidable priorities for 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, water must be recognised and governed explicitly as a national security issue that have country level consensus, not merely as a sectoral or engineering concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, Pakistan must urgently develop a defensive and adaptive approach to transboundary water challenges, one that not just prepares for uncertainty, but also internationally works for basin-level thinking to save the lives, especially those of people belonging to less privileged backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, inter-provincial water governance must be rebuilt on transparent, publicly accessible data and genuine constitutional consensus, without which technical decisions will continue to provoke political resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fourth, water quality must be elevated from a neglected environmental concern to a full-fledged public health emergency, integrated into health planning, nutrition outcomes, and productivity assessments. This leads us towards the fifth priority: groundwater — now Pakistan’s primary source of water for households and agriculture — must be governed as a shared public resource instead of an unregulated private commodity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sixth, urban water governance, particularly in Karachi, must shift decisively from emergency coping mechanisms toward durable institutional reform, equitable distribution, and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seventh, environmental flows to the Indus Delta must be legally guaranteed and treated as essential for human survival, ecological stability, and coastal security, rather than as surplus water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eighth, women must be integrated as active decision-makers in water planning and management, recognising their central role beyond the invisible labour of water collection.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot; Residents work at a damaged property, following monsoon rains and flooding, in Punjab on September 17, 2025. &amp;mdash; Reuters &quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/large/2025/12/311140220f5a373.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;Residents work at a damaged property, following monsoon rains and flooding, in Punjab on September 17, 2025. — Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, two things that require immediate attention: climate adaptation must be fully mainstreamed into all water planning, replacing reliance on historical averages with scenario-based, flexible, and risk-informed approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, water policy must be anchored in social justice, ensuring that access to safe water is upheld as a fundamental right rather than reduced to a market commodity determined by income and power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hydrological turbulence of 2025 was not an anomaly; it was a preview. It revealed what happens when fractured water diplomacy, internal mistrust, decaying infrastructure, and climate volatility collide. Water is no longer a sector to be managed; it is a constraint on Pakistan’s survival. Whether 2026 becomes a year of reform or repetition depends on whether the lessons of 2025 are heeded or willfully ignored.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Khaleda Zia&apos;s death creates a political void in Bangladesh, with her son Tarique Rahman poised to lead the BNP.  While past BNP rule saw strained India ties and ISI influence, Rahman&apos;s recent shift may suggest a more liberal, India-friendly stance. This evolution could reshape upcoming elections and regional dynamics.</description>

      <title>Injured Archer included in England T20 World Cup squad but no place for Smith</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964110/injured-archer-included-in-england-t20-world-cup-squad-but-no-place-for-smith</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Fast bowler Jofra Archer was included in England’s provisional T20 World Cup squad announced on Tuesday, despite suffering a left side strain that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962981&quot;&gt;ruled him out of&lt;/a&gt; the final two Ashes Tests, but there was no place for wicketkeeper Jamie Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archer’s fellow quick Josh Tongue has been called up to the T20 squad for the first time in a 15-man party to be captained by Harry Brook for the tournament in India and Sri Lanka beginning on February 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Archer will sit out the warm-up tour to Sri Lanka next month to continue his rehabilitation following the injury he sustained during the third Ashes Test in Adelaide earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brydon Carse will replace Archer in Sri Lanka for three one-day internationals and three Twenty20 internationals beginning on January 22.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no place, however, in the T20 World Cup squad for Smith who has endured a torrid Ashes tour of Australia, for all that is an unusual starting point in deciding selection for a white-ball tournament in the sub-continent.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/englandcricket/status/2005906710309798248?s=20&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Surrey wicketkeeper-batsman smashed 60 from 26 balls in his last T20 appearance against the West Indies in June, but was rested due to his heavy all-format workload from the subsequent series against South Africa and Ireland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But following &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963379&quot;&gt;four Tests &lt;/a&gt;in Australia where he has averaged a lowly 19.85 with the bat and endured several struggles behind the stumps, he has been left out entirely, with the experienced Jos Buttler and Phil Salt providing England with keeping options for 2024 T20 World Cup semi-finalists England.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tongue, by contrast, has never played white-ball cricket but has enhanced his reputation with impressive Ashes displays in Adelaide and Melbourne, where a England’s four-wicket win still left them 3-1 down heading into a series finale at Sydney starting Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the 28-year-old was the top wicket-taker in last season’s Hundred competition, taking 14 wickets in just six games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Test-match opening batsman Zak Crawley returns to the ODI squad for the first time since December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brook will lead his first World Cup campaign as white-ball captain, with England facing Bangladesh, West Indies, Italy and Nepal in Group C, with both managing director Rob Key and coach Brendon McCullum looking for an impressive showing after they came in for criticism following the Test team’s tame Ashes series loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;England T20 squad for World Cup squad and Sri Lanka tour:&lt;/strong&gt; Harry Brook (capt), Rehan Ahmed, Jofra Archer, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler (wkt), Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Phil Salt, Josh Tongue, Luke Wood, Brydon Carse (Sri Lanka tour only)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;England ODI squad for Sri Lanka tour:&lt;/strong&gt; Harry Brook (capt), Rehan Ahmed, Tom Banton, Jacob Bethell, Jos Buttler (wkt), Brydon Carse, Zak Crawley, Sam Curran, Liam Dawson, Ben Duckett, Will Jacks, Jamie Overton, Adil Rashid, Joe Root, Luke Wood&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What drove gen Z protests that brought down governments and called out corruption? Five activists explain</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We spoke to protesters in Togo, Kenya, Nepal, Madagascar and Morocco about how their actions helped shape the world in 2025&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mass protests in Nepal and Madagascar toppled both governments this year, even when the young people at the forefront of the demonstrations were faced with heavily armed police and the threat of arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many called 2025 the year of the protest although the revolution in Bangladesh in 2024 that unseated the authoritarian leader Sheikh Hasina is often credited with&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;inspiring young people to take to the streets across parts of Asia and Africa. Although not all achieved the change they wanted, from Sri Lanka to Timor-Leste they shared a common factor: gen Z was the driving force.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2025/dec/30/gen-z-protests-corruption-five-activists-nepal-madagascar-togo-kenya-morocco-protesters&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, dies at 80 after prolonged illness</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087/khaleda-zia-bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-dies-at-80-after-prolonged-illness</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the &lt;em&gt;Fajr&lt;/em&gt; prayer,” the party said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bdbnp78/status/2005817539113161047&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim leader Muhammad Yunus said Bangladesh “has lost a great guardian”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Through her uncompromising leadership, the nation was repeatedly freed from undemocratic conditions and inspired to regain liberty,” the Nobel Peace Prize winner said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I pray for the eternal peace and forgiveness of Begum Khaleda Zia’s soul,” ousted prime minister Sheikh Hasina said, in a statement on social media by her now banned Awami League party.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/albd1971/status/2005861396219842701&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;her arch-rival Hasina last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in late November, she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958157&quot;&gt;rushed to hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned to Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh declared three days of state mourning, with Khaleda’s funeral to be held on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim leader Yunus, in a television broadcast to the nation, appealed for calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I humbly appeal to everyone to maintain discipline while observing all forms of mourning, including the funeral prayers. I know you are all deeply emotional at this time,” Yunus said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I hope that during this difficult period, you will show utmost patience and support one another in carrying out her last rites, including the funeral.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asif Nazrul, who holds the law portfolio in the interim government, said the funeral prayers would be held in front of parliament after midday prayers, and that Zia would then be buried alongside her late husband, Ziaur Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was deeply saddened by Khaleda’s passing. “Her lifelong service to Bangladesh and its growth and development leaves a lasting legacy,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Begum Zia was a committed friend of Pakistan. My government and the people of Pakistan stand with the people of Bangladesh in this moment of sorrow,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends and the people of Bangladesh during this difficult time,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said Khaleda’s “leadership and services will be remembered with respect”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also expressed his condolences at Khaleda’s passing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he hoped Zia’s “vision and legacy will continue to guide our partnership”, a warm message despite the strained relations between New Delhi and Dhaka since Hasina’s fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#battling-begums&quot; id=&quot;battling-begums&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Battling begums’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Known by her first name, Khaleda was described as shy and devoted to raising her two sons until her husband, military leader and then-president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in an attempted army coup in 1981.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three years later she became the head of the BNP, which her husband had founded, and vowed to deliver on his aim of “liberating Bangladesh from poverty and economic backwardness”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She joined hands with Hasina, daughter of Bangladesh’s founding father and head of the Awami League party, to lead a popular uprising for democracy that toppled military ruler Hossain Mohammad Ershad in 1990.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But their cooperation did not last long. Their bitter rivalry would lead to the two being dubbed “the battling begums”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supporters saw her as polite and traditional yet quietly stylish, someone who chose her words carefully. But they also viewed her as a bold, uncompromising leader when it came to defending her party and confronting her rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, by contrast, was far more outspoken and assertive. Their opposite personalities helped fuel the rivalry that dominated Bangladesh’s politics for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1991, Bangladesh held what was hailed as its first free election. Khaleda won a surprise victory over Hasina, having gained the support of the Jamaat-e-Islami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In doing so, Khaleda became Bangladesh’s first female prime minister and only the second woman to lead a democratic government of a mainly Muslim nation after Benazir Bhutto, who was elected three years earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda replaced the presidential system with a parliamentary one, so that power rested with the prime minister. She also lifted restrictions on foreign investment and made primary education compulsory and free.&lt;br /&gt;She lost to Hasina in the 1996 general election but came back five years later with a surprise landslide win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her second term was marred by the rise of militants and allegations of corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2004, a rally that Hasina was addressing was hit by grenades. Hasina survived but over 20 people were killed and more than 500 wounded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda’s government and its allies were widely blamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, after Hasina had reclaimed Bangladesh’s highest office, Rahman was tried in absentia and sentenced to life for the attack. The BNP denounced the trial as politically motivated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#detention-and-freedom&quot; id=&quot;detention-and-freedom&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Detention and freedom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Khaleda later clamped down on radical groups, her second stint as prime minister ended in 2006 when an army-backed interim government took power amid political instability and street violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interim government jailed both Khaleda and Hasina on charges of corruption and abuse of power for about a year before they were both released ahead of a general election in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda never regained power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the BNP boycotting the 2014 and 2024 elections, her vitriolic feud with Hasina continued to dominate Bangladeshi politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tension between their two parties often led to strikes, violence and deaths, impeding the economic development of Bangladesh, a poverty-stricken country of about 175 million that is low-lying and prone to devastating floods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Khaleda, Rahman and aides were convicted of stealing some $250,000 in foreign donations received by an orphanage trust set up when she was last prime minister — charges that she said were part of a plot to keep her and her family out of politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was jailed but moved to house arrest in March 2020 on humanitarian grounds as her health deteriorated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda was freed from house arrest in August 2024 after Hasina’s ouster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2025, Khaleda and Rahman were acquitted by Bangladesh’s Supreme Court in the corruption case that resulted in the 2018 jail sentences. Rahman had been acquitted of the 2004 grenade attack on Hasina a month earlier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Afghan Taliban visit Bangladesh ahead of elections</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964043/afghan-taliban-visit-bangladesh-ahead-of-elections</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Senior envoy meets religious leaders in push for political clout&lt;br /&gt;• Religious parties eye resurgence in February polls&lt;br /&gt;• Bangladeshi officials label trip as ‘personal’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Afghan Taliban officials have held meetings with religious leaders in Bangladesh during a visit aimed at expanding political ties, officials in Dhaka said on Monday, as the country’s leaders manoeuvre for influence ahead of elections due in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kabul’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ Director General Noor Ahmad Noor met senior figures including Mamunul Haque, leader of the Khelafat-i-Majlish party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meetings took place during a week-long stay that comes at a sensitive time for the South Asian nation, which is navigating a fragile transition under an interim government. Haque told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; that Noor had visited the seminary he oversees. “It was a courtesy call, as we run one of the largest madrassas in the country,” Haque said. “He visited some other madrassas as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While religious diplomacy appea­red central to the itinerary, trade was also on the agenda. Abu Sayem Kha­led, president of the Bangladesh-Afgh­a­nistan Chamber of Commerce, told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; that the visit also sought to exp­and commercial ties between the two nations. The interim government has not officially commented on the diplomatic exchange. However, a foreign ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described Noor’s trip as “personal”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visit occurs as Bangladesh prepares for its first election since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled&lt;/a&gt; the autocratic government of Sheikh Hasina in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following her ouster, groups previously sidelined or banned are seeking a return to formal politics. This includes Jamaat-i-Islami, the country’s largest and best-organised religious party, which is ideologically aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Historical precedents of cooperation exist between militants in the two countries; the Taliban had longstanding links with the banned militant group Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami Ban­gl­adesh, with some members of the latter having fought in Afghanistan against Soviet forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reciprocal visits have also incre­ased recently. Leaders of Hefazat-i-Islam, an influential coalition of Isla­mic schools and Muslim organisations, visited Afghanistan in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon their return, they told the Dh­a­ka-based &lt;em&gt;Prothom Alo&lt;/em&gt; newspaper that they appreciated the “rule-based society” they observed under the Taliban.&lt;/p&gt;

                                        &lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) — Former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, whose archrivalry with &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-hasina-verdict-yunus-security-c1eec828e68460bae66824601a94eaca&quot;&gt;another former premier&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; defined the country’s politics for a generation, has died, her Bangladesh Nationalist Party said in a statement Tuesday. She was 80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia was the first woman elected prime minister of Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had faced corruption cases she said were politically motivated, but in January 2025, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-zia-acquittal-corruption-hasina-supreme-court-bbbbcd38e67a013815b72cc49d45f1c9&quot;&gt;the Supreme Court acquitted Zia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; in the last corruption case against her, which would have let her run in &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-anniversary-hasina-yunus-uprising-4582f6ae05aac5f50e6922d0c2e778a2&quot;&gt;February’s general election&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BNP said that after she was released from prison due to illness in 2020, her family requested the administration of her archrival, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, at least 18 times to allow her to be treated abroad, but the requests were rejected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-yunus-hasina-zia-politics-uprising-jamaat-f68cacfad0cfd31e33cccb497a564228&quot;&gt;Hasina’s ouster in 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, an interim government headed by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus finally allowed her to go. She went to London in January and returned to Bangladesh in May. &lt;/p&gt;


    
        




    


&lt;h2&gt;Zia’s fight against the military dictatorship&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-history-photo-gallery-73c4087662ed0e43b91e74429213339e&quot;&gt;early years of independence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, gained in a bloody 1971 war against Pakistan, were marked by assassinations, coups and countercoups as military figures and secular and Islamic leaders jockeyed for power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia’s husband, President Ziaur Rahman, had grabbed power as a military chief in 1977 and a year later formed the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. He was credited with opening democracy in the country, but he was killed in a 1981 military coup. Zia’s uncompromising stance against the military dictatorship helped build a mass movement against it, culminating with the ousting of dictator and former army chief H.M. Ershad in 1990. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
    





&lt;p&gt;



    &lt;p&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;

            
        
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s opponent when she won her first term in 1991 and in several elections after that was Hasina, the daughter of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who was assassinated in a 1975 coup. &lt;/p&gt;
    
    
        
            
                
    
    &lt;a id=&quot;html-embed-module-e30000&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


    
    &lt;p&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;

            
        
    
    
&lt;p&gt;Zia was criticized over an early 1996 election in which her party won 278 of the 300 parliamentary seats during a wide boycott by other leading parties including Hasina’s Awami League, which demanded an election-time caretaker government. Zia’s government lasted only 12 days before a nonpartisan caretaker government was installed and the new election was held that June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia returned to power in 2001 in a government shared with the country’s main Islamist party, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-islamist-hasina-yunus-7bcf60910c94bef1730d0c8d62f22883&quot;&gt;Jamaat-e-Islami&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which had a dark past involving Bangladesh’s independence war. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;Rivalry with Hasina&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party was previously closely allied with the party, and her government maintained the confidence of the business community by following pro-investment, open market policies. Zia was known to have a soft spot for Pakistan and used to deliver anti-Indian political speeches. India alleged insurgents were allowed to use Bangladesh’s soil to destabilize India’s northeastern states under Zia, especially during her second term from 2001-2006. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that term, Zia was also tainted by allegations that her elder son, Tarique Rahman, was running a parallel government and was involved in widespread corruption. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, Hasina blamed Zia’s government and Rahman &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/general-news-15cc06be5bae433a94b5054d8691ad01&quot;&gt;for grenade attacks in Dhaka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that killed 24 members of her Awami League party and wounded hundreds of people. Hasina narrowly escaped the attack, which she characterized as an assassination attempt, and subsequently won the 2008 general election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia’s party and its partners boycotted the 2014 election in a dispute over a caretaker government, giving a one-sided victory to the increasingly authoritarian regime of Hasina. Her party joined the national elections in 2018 but boycotted again in 2024, allowing Hasina to return to power for a fourth consecutive time &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/sheikh-hasina-awami-league-boycott-opposition-bangladesh-election-1506563c63b06166f800e8e89332b4e3&quot;&gt;through controversial elections&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia was sentenced to 17 years in jail &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/general-news-272d601763d34acd98a081f9ddf7375c&quot;&gt;in two separate corruption cases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; for misuse of power in embezzling funds meant for a charity named after her late husband. Her party said the charges were politically motivated to weaken the opposition, but the Hasina government said it did not interfere and the case was a matter for the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hasina was bitterly criticized by both her opponents and independent critics for sending Zia to jail. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;Health concerns trump politics&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia was released from jail by Hasina’s government in 2020 and was moved to a rented home, from where she regularly visited a private hospital. Her family repeatedly requested Hasina’s administration to allow Zia to travel abroad for medical treatment, but was refused. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 15 years in power, Hasina was ousted in a mass uprising in August 2024 and fled the country. &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/bangladesh-zia-yunus-hasina-election-246a0a75ae2fcab2e03ddfb13c611491&quot;&gt;Zia was given permission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; to travel abroad by an interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zia was silent about politics for years and did not attend political rallies, but she remained the BNP chairperson until her death. Rahman has been the party’s acting chair since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She was last seen at an annual function of the Bangladesh military in Dhaka Cantonment on Nov. 21, when Yunus and other political leaders met her. She was in a wheelchair and appeared pale and tired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She is survived by Rahman, her elder son and heir apparent in the political dynasty. Her younger son, Arafat, died in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, dies at 80 after prolonged illness</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087/bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-khaleda-zia-dies-at-80-after-prolonged-illness</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the &lt;em&gt;Fajr&lt;/em&gt; prayer,” the party said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/bdbnp78/status/2005817539113161047&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in late November, she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958157&quot;&gt;rushed to hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus called for the nation to pray for Zia, calling her a “source of utmost inspiration for the nation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP’s media chief Moudud Alamgir Pavel also confirmed Zia’s death to &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned to Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh’s former prime minister and opposition leader Khaleda Zia has died at the age of 80, her party said Tuesday, just months before elections many expected would return her to power. Her death ends a turbulent political career marked by imprisonment, ill health and a dramatic comeback attempt following the fall of her longtime rival Sheikh Hasina.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, dies at 80</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087/bangladeshs-first-female-prime-minister-khaleda-zia-dies-at-80</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, died after a prolonged illness, her opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Khaleda, aged 80, had advanced cirrhosis of the liver, arthritis, diabetes, chest and heart problems, her doctors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP chairperson and former prime minister, the national leader Begum Khaleda Zia, passed away today at 6:00am (0000 GMT), just after the &lt;em&gt;Fajr&lt;/em&gt; prayer,” the party said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We pray for the forgiveness of her soul and request everyone to offer prayers for her departed soul,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in elections set for February 2026 — the first vote since a mass uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled &lt;/a&gt;her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia’s BNP is widely seen as a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in late November, she was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958157&quot;&gt;rushed to hospital&lt;/a&gt;, where, despite the best efforts of medics, her condition declined from a raft of health issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her final days, interim leader Muhammad Yunus called for the nation to pray for Zia, calling her a “source of utmost inspiration for the nation”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP’s media chief Moudud Alamgir Pavel also confirmed Zia’s death to &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zia was jailed for corruption in 2018 under Hasina’s government, which also blocked her from travelling abroad for medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was released last year, shortly after Hasina was forced from power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There had been plans earlier this month to fly her on a special air ambulance to London, but her condition was not stable enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her son, political heavyweight Tarique Rahman, only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned to Bangladesh &lt;/a&gt;after 17 years in self-imposed exile on Thursday, where he was welcomed back by huge crowds of joyous supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman will lead the party through the February 12 general election, and is expected to be put forward as prime minister if his party wins a majority.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh’s three-time prime minister Khaleda Zia, who hoped to lead her nation one last time after the election next year, died on Tuesday aged 80, her party said.
The government declared three days of state mourning, with her funeral to be held on Wednesday.
Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in the election set for February – the first vote since a mass uprising toppled her arch-rival Sheikh Hasina last year.

      <title>Bangladesh’s Gen-Z party faces revolt over religious alliance, risking its future</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963946/bangladeshs-gen-z-party-faces-revolt-over-religious-alliance-risking-its-future</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Bangladeshi youth-driven party born out of the country’s 2024 uprising is facing an open revolt from within after sealing an election alliance with a religio-political group, a move analysts say could jeopardise its future and reinforce established parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 30 senior leaders of the National Citizen Party (NCP) have openly opposed its alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, announced on Sunday, with several resigning in protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Muslim-majority South Asian nation goes to the polls on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1960599&quot;&gt;February 12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the deal, opinion polls had predicted Jamaat finishing a close second behind the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, while the NCP lagged far behind in third place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The NCP presented itself as a youth-driven alternative to traditional power structures. That identity is now under serious strain,” said H.M. Nazmul Alam, an academic. “Youth-based movements do not collapse only because they lose elections. They collapse when they lose clarity and internal unity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#alliance-for-greater-unity&quot; id=&quot;alliance-for-greater-unity&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Alliance for greater unity’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCP was formed earlier this year by leaders of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1846440&quot;&gt;protests &lt;/a&gt;that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief&quot;&gt;ousted &lt;/a&gt;long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, forcing her to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief#:~:text=Hasina%20flees%20to%20India&quot;&gt;flee &lt;/a&gt;to India. Driven by Gen-Z activists born after the late 1990s, it says it aims to free the nation from decades of nepotism and the dominance of Hasina’s Awami League and the BNP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Awami League banned, the vote will be effectively a direct contest between the BNP and Jamaat, which has trailed the other two in the past and had not been allowed to contest any elections since 2013 after a court said its registration as a political party conflicted with Bangladesh’s secular constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1855267&quot;&gt;revoked &lt;/a&gt;all the restrictions on Jamaat in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCP’s struggle shows the challenges of turning street power into votes and holds lessons for neighbouring Nepal, where similar youth-led protests ousted the government this year and fresh elections are due in March, political analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCP chief Nahid Islam told a press conference late on Sunday that the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928&quot;&gt;killing &lt;/a&gt;of 32-year-old Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the uprising, forced his party to seek an alliance to keep at bay forces trying to derail the election through violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The dictatorship we overthrew is attempting to sabotage the election. Therefore, for the sake of greater unity, we have reached an electoral understanding with Jamaat, said Nahid, 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was a majority decision within the party, but some may be opposed to it and they are free to take their own decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier in December while launching his election campaign as an independent candidate. Police say they have identified the killers but have not apprehended them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#your-centrist-idea-and-ideology-will-vanish&quot; id=&quot;your-centrist-idea-and-ideology-will-vanish&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Your centrist idea and ideology will vanish’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nahid earlier told Reuters his organisation was weak because it had not had enough time to build itself. It was also hampered by scarce funds and an unclear stance on key issues such as rights for women and minorities, Reuters reported in early December, citing party leaders who said alliance talks had been underway for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One senior NCP leader to have resigned is Tasnim Jara, a doctor who left a career in Britain to join the party. She is now seeking the support of nearly 5,000 voters to be allowed to contest as an independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I promised you and the people of this country that I would fight for you and for building a new political culture,” she said on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whatever the circumstances, I am determined to keep that promise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political analyst Asif Shahan, a professor at the University of Dhaka, said the NCP was “doomed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you go with Jamaat, it will help Jamaat, not you,” he said. “It will give them a liberal cover, and in return, you will become a force for the right. Your centrist idea and ideology - already poorly defined - will simply vanish.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh’s youth-driven National Citizen Party (NCP) is facing internal revolt after forming an election alliance with Islamist group Jamaat-e-Islami, a move that has sparked resignations and could undermine its credibility ahead of February 12 polls. At least 30 senior leaders openly opposed the decision, warning it risks eroding the party’s Gen-Z identity and core principles. [&amp;#8230;]</description>

      &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-subhead&quot;&gt;The ECHR asked the UK to justify stripping Shamima Begum of citizenship amid concerns that she was groomed and trafficked into Syria&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-main-image&quot;&gt;    
                  &lt;source height=&quot;915&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-cutline&quot;&gt;Begum fled her East London home at the age of 15 to join the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria with two school friends (AFP) &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-wide-photo-video&quot;&gt;Off&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has called on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; government to explain its decision to strip a British woman of her citizenship after she fled to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/syria&quot;&gt;Syria &lt;/a&gt;as a 15-year-old to join the Islamic State (IS) group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late December, the Strasbourg court sent a series of questions to the British government, asking whether it broke anti-trafficking obligations when it stripped &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-supreme-court-refuse-hear-shamima-begum-appeal&quot;&gt;Shamima Begum&lt;/a&gt; of her citizenship in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions include whether the government violated Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits slavery, servitude, forced labour, and a state’s duty to prevent and investigate trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped Begum of her citizenship on national security grounds after his office said that the deprivation was “conducive to the public good” and that not doing so posed a threat to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javid also justified the decision to strip her British citizenship on the grounds that she qualified for a Bangladeshi passport through her parents’ heritage, despite never visiting or living in the South Asian country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begum made headlines when she fled to Syria in 2015 to join IS with two school friends from her East London home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She reappeared four years later after journalists tracked her down in IS territory. At the time, she was&amp;nbsp;heavily pregnant with a child who later passed away,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Begum has tried and failed multiple times, to return to the UK and restore her citizenship in a series of legal battles with the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of those attempts have been successful and she continues to be held in a prison camp in northern Syria controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECHR is also assessing whether the Home Office failed to take into account whether she was a victim of trafficking, and if removing her citizenship could have stopped the government’s duty to investigate how she was allowed to leave the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Catalogue of failures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her application to the Strasbourg court, Begum’s lawyers said that the UK authorities failed to ask four questions before depriving her of her citizenship, namely: whether she had been trafficked to Syria, whether British authorities failed to protect her, and whether her deprivation of citizenship would undermine any future investigation into potential trafficking, and if trafficking issues were present, whether deprivation could be justified on national-security grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birnberg Peirce Solicitors, which represents Begum, described the ECHR’s intervention as an “unprecedented opportunity” for the UK government to assess whether previous administrations ignored or sidestepped any considerations made to strip her of her citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Strasbourg’s communication presents an unprecedented opportunity for the UK as well as for Ms Begum - to grapple with the significant considerations raised in her case and ignored, sidestepped or violated up to now by previous UK administrations,” said Gareth Peirce, the lawyer representing Begum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is impossible to dispute that a 15-year-old British child was in 2014-15 lured, encouraged, and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to ISIL-controlled territory for the known purpose of being given, as a child, to an ISIL fighter to propagate children for the Islamic State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The police failed to warn families, informed the school that its apprehension of risk was overstated, conducted no safeguarding measures, delayed contact with ports and known routes of travel to trigger alarms and prevent [them] reaching the known destination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Home Office did not respond to Middle East Eye’s request for comment at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Declan Morgan, the former lord chief justice of Ireland, said Britain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/former-northern-irish-lord-chief-justice-says-uk-wrong-strip-shamima-begum-citizenship&quot;&gt;should not have stripped&lt;/a&gt; Begum of her British citizenship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan, who serves as a a supplementary panel member of the UK Supreme Court, made the remarks&amp;nbsp; at the launch of a new&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/sweeping-uk-terror-law-label-harmful-behaviour-terrorism-prevent-overhaul&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by the Independent Commission on UK Counter-Terrorism Law, Policy and Practice, which he chairs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Special Immigration Appeals Court found that the conditions in the prison camp where Begum is being arbitrarily detained without trial constituted inhuman and degrading treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years later, SIAC also found that the state failed to protect her but noted that its “hands were tied” as a result of the Supreme Court’s limiting the immigration court’s ability to take into consideration the merits of Begum’s case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECHR’s intervention comes as activists ramp up their campaigning against the UK’s growing use of citizenship-stripping powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final judgement is expected at a later date, following submissions from the UK government and Begum’s lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Karachi-Dhaka flights likely from January, says Pakistan’s high commissioner</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963937/karachi-dhaka-flights-likely-from-january-says-pakistans-high-commissioner</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider expressed hope on Monday that direct flights between Karachi and Dhaka will start in January, during a meeting with the Chief Advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during Sheikh Hasina’s rule. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, relations between the two countries improved markedly, with Professor Muhammad Yunus leading the interim administration in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChiefAdviserGoB/status/2005281898424381710&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the meeting, both sides discussed ways to expand cooperation in trade, investment, and aviation, as well as scaling up cultural, educational, and medical exchanges to further strengthen bilateral relations between the two South Asian nations,” said a statement shared on X by Bangladesh’s interim leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haider, during the meeting, also noted that bilateral trade has recorded a 20 per cent growth compared to last year, with business communities from both countries actively exploring new investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high commissioner further highlighted a “significant increase” in cultural exchanges, adding that “Bangladeshi students have shown strong interest in higher education opportunities in Pakistan, particularly in medical sciences, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan has witnessed a rise in patients travelling to its leading hospitals for liver and kidney transplants,” said Islamabad’s envoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, the high commissioner also stated that Pakistan was ready to offer “training and academic opportunities in transplantation-related medical fields”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that Bangladesh’s interim leader welcomed the “growing interactions between the two countries” and emphasised the “importance of increased visits, as well as cultural, educational, and people-to-people exchanges among SAARC member states.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Professor Yunus also underscored the need to further boost Bangladesh–Pakistan trade,” added the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus also expressed hope that during the current high commissioner’s tenure, both countries would “explore new avenues for investment and joint venture businesses“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1936871/fm-dar-meets-bangladeshs-yunus-during-historic-visit-as-revitalising-saarc-comes-under-focus&quot;&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; with Professor Yunus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1935344&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;landmark visit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Dhaka, both countries stressed the need to revitalise regional cooperation through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Office (FO) termed Dar’s two-day visit — the first by a Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh in 13 years — a “significant milestone” in the two countries’ relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paki­stan and Bangladesh had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1926083&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;agreed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side a month before, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The recent homecoming of Tarique Rahman, the de facto leader of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and heir to one of the country’s most powerful political families, is widely expected to reshape the political trajectory ahead of February’s national election.

                                        &lt;p&gt;GENEVA (AP) — The United States on Monday announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to slash U.S. foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies to “adapt, shrink or die” in a time of new financial realities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The money is a small fraction of what the U.S. has contributed in the past but reflects what the administration believes is a generous amount that will maintain the United States’ status as the world’s largest humanitarian donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pledge creates an umbrella fund from which money will be doled out to individual agencies and priorities, a key part of U.S. demands for drastic changes across the world body that have alarmed many humanitarian workers and led to severe reductions in programs and services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $2 billion is only a sliver of traditional U.S. humanitarian funding for U.N.-backed programs, which has run as high as $17 billion annually in recent years, according to U.N. data. U.S. officials say only $8-$10 billion of that has been in voluntary contributions. The United States also pays billions in annual dues related to its U.N. membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say the Western aid cutbacks have been shortsighted, driven &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/world-food-program-hunger-trump-afghanistan-congo-somalia-sudan-3271c01a60128ae54e4ff4867b904826&quot;&gt;millions toward hunger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, displacement or disease, and harmed &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-china-foreign-aid-global-influence-d7f3ac76dcbf7c9b75e7b147d8d8fcb6&quot;&gt;U.S. soft power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A year of crisis in aid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move caps a crisis year for many U.N. organizations like its refugee, migration and food aid agencies. The Trump administration has &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/unhcr-trump-iom-ocha-unaids-world-health-organization-d5372e0193c720b55b88db7dcd1c7f0a&quot;&gt;already cut billions in U.S. foreign aid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, prompting them to slash spending, aid projects and thousands of jobs. Other traditional Western donors have reduced outlays, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announced U.S. pledge for aid programs of the United Nations — the world’s top provider of humanitarian assistance and biggest recipient of U.S. humanitarian aid money — takes shape in a preliminary deal with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, run by Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat and government official. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;Even as the U.S. pulls back its aid, needs have ballooned across the world: Famine has been recorded this year in parts of conflict-ridden &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/sudan-famine-darfur-ipc-elfasher-e4816f40ac2b2852b0b70c85e8f741d1&quot;&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/gaza-famine-hunger-israel-ceasefire-a5f88e20db2a5c4f754117de9bdada69&quot;&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and floods, drought and natural disasters that many scientists attribute to climate change have taken many lives or driven thousands from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts will have major implications for U.N. affiliates like the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/iom-migration-us-aid-cuts-humanitarian-migrants-61cdf8c96a0a26211a2c8cd5042a44d1&quot;&gt;International Organization for Migration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the World Food Program and refugee agency UNHCR. They have already received billions less from the U.S. this year than under annual allocations from the previous Biden administration — or even during Trump’s first term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the idea is that Fletcher’s office — which last year set in motion a “humanitarian reset” to improve efficiency, accountability and effectiveness of money spent — will become a funnel for U.S. and other aid money that can be then redirected to those agencies, rather than scattered U.S. contributions to a variety of individual appeals for aid. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;US seeks aid consolidation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States wants to see “more consolidated leadership authority” in U.N. aid delivery systems, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide details before the announcement at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the plan, Fletcher and his coordination office “are going to control the spigot” on how money is distributed to agencies, the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This humanitarian reset at the United Nations should deliver more aid with fewer tax dollars — providing more focused, results-driven assistance aligned with U.S foreign policy,” said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Michael Waltz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials say the $2 billion is just a first outlay to help fund OCHA’s annual appeal for money, announced earlier this month. Fletcher, noting the upended aid landscape, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/un-switzerland-humanitarian-aid-ocha-funding-e764d76f3a5adcd861899a3b0be66ab3&quot;&gt;already slashed the request this year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Other traditional U.N. donors like Britain, France, Germany and Japan have reduced aid allocations and sought reforms this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The agreement requires the U.N. to consolidate humanitarian functions to reduce bureaucratic overhead, unnecessary duplication, and ideological creep,” the State Department said in a statement. “Individual U.N. agencies will need to adapt, shrink, or die.” &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;“Nowhere is reform more important than the humanitarian agencies, which perform some of the U.N.’s most critical work,” the department added. “Today’s agreement is a critical step in those reform efforts, balancing President Trump’s commitment to remaining the world’s most generous nation, with the imperative to bring reform to the way we fund, oversee, and integrate with U.N. humanitarian efforts.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core, the reform project will help establish pools of funding that can be directed either to specific crises or countries in need. A total of 17 countries will be targeted initially, including Bangladesh, Congo, Haiti, Syria and Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;One of the world’s most desperate countries, Afghanistan, is not included, nor are the Palestinian territories, which officials say will be covered by money stemming from Trump’s as-yet-incomplete Gaza peace plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, months in the making, stems from Trump’s longtime view that the world body has great promise, but has failed to live up to it, and has — in his eyes — drifted too far from its original mandate to save lives while undermining American interests, promoting radical ideologies and encouraging wasteful, unaccountable spending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher praised the deal, saying in a statement, “At a moment of immense global strain, the United States is demonstrating that it is a humanitarian superpower, offering hope to people who have lost everything.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee reported from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh’s National Citizen Party: ‘new hope’ that looks like the old guard</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963842/bangladeshs-national-citizen-party-new-hope-that-looks-like-the-old-guard</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE National Citizen Party (NCP) was born with a claim that it would not practise politics as usual. Emerging from the July uprising, it asked people to see it as a break from Bangladesh’s old habits of convenience and compromise. It promised to distinguish itself with its own political language and its own sense of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two developments have turned speculation into a moment of reckoning. Tasnim Jara, a senior and one of the more visible leaders, in her own right, resigned from the party. She announced she would contest the Dhaka-9 constituency as an independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, 30 members of the party’s central committee have formally written to Convener Nahid Islam, opposing any political alliance or seat-sharing arrangement with Jamaat-i-Islami. It has now become a question of credibility for the NCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seat-sharing is not unusual in Bangladesh. Elections are fought one constituency at a time and depend on organisation, polling agents and the ability to protect votes. New parties struggle because these structures take years to build. Seat sharing arrangements or alliance might make sense for electoral politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the NCP did not enter politics asking to be judged by that standard alone. From the outset, it framed itself as the political expression of a movement that rejected the logic of a deal that “works”. Its leaders, shaped by the July uprising, spoke against shortcuts, against recycling old alignments, and against moral ambiguity. They spoke of a new arrangement, ‘Naya Bondobosto’ as they kept harping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That positioning mattered. It is why many young people, first-time participants and politically unaffiliated citizens placed their trust in the party. What has changed since then? If the NCP has reassessed its strength and concluded that contesting independently is not viable in this election cycle, it should say so plainly. Admitting organisational limits would not weaken the party. It would demonstrate seriousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any understanding with Jamaat-i-Islami also carries a weight far beyond seat numbers. Jamaat’s opposition to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1704822&quot;&gt;independence in 1971&lt;/a&gt; and its role during the Liberation War are not fringe allegations. They are part of Bangladesh’s mainstream political history. That history has shaped alliances, exclusions and public trust for decades. It cannot be set aside through electoral arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasnim Jara’s decision brings this tension into sharp focus. In announcing her independent candidacy on Facebook, she openly acknowledged the disadvantages of running without party infrastructure, an organised worker base, or institutional access to security and administration. Yet she chose that path, citing her commitment to a new political culture and the promise she had made to voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central committee letter makes the issue impossible to dismiss as personal dissent. The 30 signatories invoke the NCP’s declared ideology, the historical responsibility of the July uprising and democratic ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They explicitly cite Jamaat’s political history, particularly its role in 1971, as incompatible with the party’s values. They also warn of immediate consequences, saying that even reports of a possible alliance have already led supporters and organisers to reconsider their backing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money adds another layer of accountability. The NCP presented itself as a citizen-funded alternative to patronage politics. Crowdfunding is not merely a financial tool. It is a political contract. Many of those contributors are uncomfortable with Jamaat’s history and politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the party now moves in a direction that contradicts the assumptions under which that money was raised, the cost will extend beyond this election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warnings have also come from within the wider July movement. Abdul Kader, a former coordinator associated with the uprising, has cautioned publicly that an NCP–Jamaat understanding risks damaging the future of youth politics. That concern reflects a fear that a rare moment of political clarity is being traded for short-term opportunism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the NCP believes reform is impossible without parliamentary seats, it should say so. If it believes contesting independently is not viable this time, it should explain why. If it believes seat-sharing with Jamaat does not dilute its core commitments, it must articulate those commitments clearly and draw its red lines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Student leader’s killing continues to drive Bangladesh unrest</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963867/student-leaders-killing-continues-to-drive-bangladesh-unrest</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Inqilab Moncho-led demos held across key highways in Dhaka, other major cities&lt;br /&gt;• Official says charge sheet to be filed within 10 days&lt;br /&gt;• Suspects ‘fled to India’: police&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Inqilab Moncho and allied groups staged simultaneous blockades across major highways and intersections in various cities across Bangladesh on Sunday, demanding justice for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962210&quot;&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; of student leader Sharif Osman Hadi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi, a vocal critic of India who took part in last year’s mass uprising, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961387&quot;&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier this month and later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities hit by the protests included Dhaka, Chattogram, Rajshahi, Gazipur, Barishal, Cumilla and Khulna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders and activists of Inqilab Moncho blocked the Shahbagh intersection in Dhaka for the third consecutive day on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Statements from the administration are nothing but eyewash. They are simply trying to waste time. The perpetrators could have been arrested on the very day the shooting happened,” said Naim Islam, a central member of Inqilab Moncho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government must disclose to the public who is pressuring whom. They claim some people have been arrested, but the real killer must be brought to justice,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The interim government is determined to ensure justice for the [Hadi’s] killing,” he said, adding that police, Border Guard Bangladesh, Rapid Action Battalion, and intelligence agencies were working closely and in coordination to uncover the facts behind the murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure has been mounting on Bangladesh’s interim government to arrest the killers of Hadi, who was set to contest the general elections in February next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s home adviser, retired Lt Gen Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, said investigators were expected to submit the charge sheet in the popular student leader’s murder case within 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said authorities had made significant progress, but not everything could be disclosed at the moment to protect the integrity of the investigation and to identify both the perpetrators and those who backed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said 11 people have so far been arrested in the case, including the wife and parents of the alleged mastermind, Faisal Karim Masud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the arrestees, six gave confessional statements under Section 164, while four witnesses also gave statements under the same provision, the adviser said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on information from the arrestees, witness statements, reviews of recovered evidence and an overall assessment, the investigation is now in its final stage, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I request everyone to remain patient,” he said, adding that a decision had already been made to transfer the case to a speedy trial tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to assure you that the trial in the Hadi murder case will be completed within the tenure of the current interim government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Fled to India’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; quoted Bangladesh police as saying that Hadi’s suspected killers had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963734&quot;&gt;fled&lt;/a&gt; to India, in comments likely to further strain relations with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The killing was premeditated. Those behind it have been identified,” Nazrul Islam, a senior Dhaka Metropolitan Police officer, said at a news conference He added that the suspects left Bangladesh through the Haluaghat border on Dec 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were received at the border by two Indian citizens, who escorted them into the northeastern state of Meghalaya before handing them over to two accomplices.” Bangladeshi investigators were in contact with their Indian counterparts, who had arrested the two suspected accomplices, Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PTI will use protests to push govt for talks: Afridi</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963862/pti-will-use-protests-to-push-govt-for-talks-afridi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• KP CM says dialogue without ‘resistance’ not effective; Karachi his ‘next destination’&lt;br /&gt;• Believes talks can be meaningful if ‘power-wielding individuals’ participate&lt;br /&gt;• Azma claims ‘street movement’ failed to attract public, dubs it ‘social media hype’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: After spending three days in the provincial capital &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963371&quot;&gt;galvanising&lt;/a&gt; party supporters, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Min­ister Sohail Afridi said the PTI would not engage in talks with the government without first taking to the streets to demonstrate its opposition to the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His remarks come as party leaders are split into two camps: one led by veterans favouring dialogue, while the other is bent on street agitation as per the directions of the incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day earlier, CM Afridi said the decision to initiate talks rested with the opposition alliance, and that he was in charge of the ‘street movement’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CM Afridi, along with other provincial ministers and members of the assembly, had arrived in Lahore to launch a new street movement, as per the directives of Imran Khan. He left the provincial capital in the evening. Before Afridi, his predecessor, Ali Amin Gandapur, also came to Lahore earlier this year, ostensibly to launch a protest drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Mr Afridi told journalists at a meeting that reconciliation was impossible without resistance. “We will be at a loss if we enter into dialogue without resistance. So, the protest movement will continue until the rulers come to the table after recognising the opposition as an equal partner,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to a question whether the party had perpetually been protesting without any result, CM Afridi said, “This time, we will not make tall claims but do practical work and come up with a positive output.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing his thoughts about the dialogue &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962792/if-they-are-ready-govt-is-definitely-ready-pm-shehbaz-reiterates-offer-for-dialogue-with-opposition&quot;&gt;offered&lt;/a&gt; by the government, the CM claimed there must have been some ‘direction’ from the powers that be to the PM that he offered talks. He said talks could be meaningful only after inclusion of individuals who wielded power and influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We could not develop a working relationship with the establishment because they did not accept my policy and I could not accept their policy,” he said in response to a question about him reaching out to the powerful quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The establishment now knows that the incumbent rulers were unable to take Pakistan forward,” he said, while accusing the ruling parties of corruption and economic mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Afridi said it was not necessary that the PTI pick D-Chowk in Islamabad as its protest site, as it did in November last year, adding that it was also not important to end the protest after a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an X post, the CM also announced his intention of visiting Karachi for the ‘street movement’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SohailAfridiISF/status/2005299736509837401&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, meanwhile, said no political party could go into a blind alley. “We are seeing that the government wants the PTI to neither speak about its election fraud, the release of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, nor question institutions’ interference in politics and journalism. Then what should we do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Raja said reconciliation and dialogue could only begin when the “basic principles” would be agreed — otherwise the party would take to the streets to get these principles accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting with journalists, CM Afridi was stopped from entering the Lahore cantonment area, where he had plans to meet the families of incarcerated former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and advocate Hassaan Niazi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KP CM said he had been stopped as they had made (cantonement) a no-go area. “I have asked whether Pakistan’s territory ended here and another country’s land started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Punjab government should not have behaved in such a harsh manner with the chief minister of a province. This has all been happening with me for the past three consecutive days,” he lamented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The KP CM is also ready to go without his gunmen and KP police, but is still not being allowed,” Salman Akram Raja said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azma ridicules PTI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari ridiculed the PTI’s street movement, saying its reality was “exposed in daylight after social media hype overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement on X, Ms Bokhari quipped that PTI supporters were celebrating by sharing images of Bangladesh since last night, claiming that the so-called street movement failed to attract any public response during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AzmaBokhariPMLN/status/2005233578763038959&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said there was no one even to respond to the slogans raised by the protesters. Taking a jibe at the demonstrators, she said they had “toured the ‘Europe of Pakistan,’ Lahore, enough under heavy protocol” and should now return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please, let Lahore breathe in peace,” she said, adding that PTI leaders should go back and address the issues of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead. She urged PTI to focus on public welfare in its own province rather than staging what she termed ineffective protests elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amjad Mahmood also contributed to this report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A proposed electoral alliance between Bangladesh&apos;s National Citizen Party and Jamaat-e-Islami is causing divisions. Thirty NCP leaders have protested, citing Jamaat&apos;s controversial past including its role in the 1971 Liberation War. This move comes as seat-sharing talks near completion. Some NCP leaders previously belonged to Jamaat&apos;s student wing. Jamaat sought partnership with NCP over the BNP.</description>

      <title>Party would move towards dialogue after ensuring level-playing field provided through street movement: PTI</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963737/party-would-move-towards-dialogue-after-ensuring-level-playing-field-provided-through-street-movement-pti</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The PTI on Sunday denied opting to engage in dialogue with the government as an underdog but said that it will do so “after ensuring a level-playing field is provided to it through street movements“, according to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and the PTI Secretary-General, Salman Akram Raja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CM Afridi, along with other provincial ministers and members of the assembly, was in Lahore to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963371&quot;&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; a new street movement, as per the directives of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan. He left for the motorway at about 6:40pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a discussion with senior journalists at a private residence in Lahore’s Defence Housing Authority earlier in the day, Afridi asserted that reconciliation was impossible without resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will be at a loss if we enter into dialogue without resistance. So, the protest movement will continue until the rulers come to the table after recognising the opposition as an equal partner,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to a question whether the party had perpetually been protesting without yielding any result, CM Afridi said, “This time, we will not make tall claims but do practical work and come up with a positive output.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary-General Raja said no political party could go into a blind alley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing that the government want the PTI to neither speak about its election fraud, the release of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, nor question institutions’ interference in politics and journalism. Then what should we do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raja said reconciliation and dialogue could only begin when the “basic principles” would be agreed – otherwise the party would take to the streets to get these principles accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting with journalists, CM Afridi visited the residences of party leaders Mirza Afridi, but was stopped from entering the Lahore cantonment area, where he had plans to meet the families of incarcerated former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and advocate Hassan Niazi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KP CM said he had been stopped as they had made (cantonement) a no-go area. “I have asked whether Pakistan’s territory ended here and another country’s land started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Punjab government should not have behaved in such a harsh manner with the chief minister of a province. This has all been happening with me for the past three consecutive days,” he lamented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have been asking to go to the party leaders’ residences in the cantonment but was told that I was not permitted,” he said and demanded that he be given a reason “in writing” as to why he was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The KP CM is also ready to go without his gunmen and KP police, but is still not being allowed,” Salman Akram Raja said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962792/if-they-are-ready-govt-is-definitely-ready-pm-shehbaz-reiterates-offer-for-dialogue-with-opposition&quot;&gt;offered&lt;/a&gt; talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#street-movement-failed-to-attract-public-azma&quot; id=&quot;street-movement-failed-to-attract-public-azma&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Street movement failed to attract public’: Azma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister, Azma Bokhari, ridiculed the PTI’s street movement, saying its reality was “exposed in daylight after social media hype overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AzmaBokhariPMLN/status/2005233578763038959&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a statement on X, Bokhari remarked that PTI supporters were celebrating by sharing images of Bangladesh since last night, claiming that the so-called street movement failed to attract any public response during the day.&lt;br /&gt;She said there was no one even to respond to the slogans raised by the protesters. Taking a jibe at the demonstrators, Bokhari said they had “toured the ‘Europe of Pakistan,’ Lahore, enough under heavy protocol” and should now return.&lt;br /&gt;“Please, let Lahore breathe in peace,” she said, adding that PTI leaders should go back and address the issues of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead.&lt;br /&gt;She urged PTI to focus on public welfare in its own province rather than staging what she termed ineffective protests elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sikh activists clash with Hindu protesters outside Bangladeshi High Commission in London</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963739/sikh-activists-clash-with-hindu-protesters-outside-bangladeshi-high-commission-in-london</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LONDON: A demonstration outside the Bangladeshi High Commission in London on Saturday briefly turned tense when pro-Khalistan Sikh activists and a small group of Hindu protesters confronted each other, prompting police intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Khalistan Movement wants an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1776744#:~:text=wants%20an%20independent%20Sikh%20state%20carved%20out%20of%20India%20and%20dates%20back%20to%20India%20and%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20independence%20in%201947%20when%20the%20idea%20was%20pushed%20forward%20in%20negotiations%20preceding%20the%20partition%20of%20the%20Punjab%20region%20between%20the%20two%20new%20countries.&quot;&gt;independent Sikh state&lt;/a&gt; carved out of India and dates back to India and Pakistan’s independence in 1947, when the idea was pushed forward in negotiations preceding the partition of the Punjab region between the two new countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protest was held in connection with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808#:~:text=lynching%20of%20a%20Hindu%20man%20over%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy.&quot;&gt;reports of violence&lt;/a&gt; against Hindus in Bangladesh. During the gathering, Paramjeet Singh Pamma, identified by organisers as a coordinator of the Khalistan Referendum campaign, was involved in a brief scuffle with an Indian Hindu protester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metropolitan Police officers on duty intervened quickly, separating the individuals and dispersing the groups from close proximity to the mission building. No injuries were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SFJ_US_Official/status/2004947498058531220&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the incident, pro-Khalistan Sikh protesters formed a cordon near the embassy entrance and continued their demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They raised political slogans, accusing the Indian government of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1918029&quot;&gt;involvement&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1831329&quot;&gt;killings &lt;/a&gt;of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and others. Police maintained a presence to prevent further confrontation and said the situation was brought under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has designated Pamma as a “most wanted terrorist” — a charge he and his supporters reject. He currently resides in the United Kingdom. UK authorities have not announced any charges against him, and previous Indian requests related to his extradition have not resulted in court action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan Police did not issue any immediate statement on arrests or further action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nijjar was &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/advocate-separate-sikh-state-india-shot-dead-canada-hardeep-singh-nijjar-temple&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;shot dead&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 45 by masked gunmen outside the temple he presided over after being wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism offences and conspiracy to commit murder — accusations he denied. His murder in June 2023 near his home in Vancouver sparked a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1865190&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;diplomatic storm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between India and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in November 2023, US authorities &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1791573&quot;&gt;thwarted &lt;/a&gt;a plot to kill Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the United States and issued a warning to India over concerns the government in New Delhi was involved, the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times (FT)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/56f7d6d6-6a93-4172-a49e-d8a91991e29d&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, an Indian intelligence official and an Indian national &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1866009&quot;&gt;indicted &lt;/a&gt;for their role in the plot to kill Pannun, according to the US Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in March this year, India asked the US to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1898726&quot;&gt;list &lt;/a&gt;Sikhs For Justice, a separatist group, as a terrorist organisation — a point that came up during talks between Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and visiting US national intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For now, Rahman’s return is a consequential fact: it reshapes domestic dynamics and reframes the bilateral conversation at a critical moment in Bangladesh’s political calendar. If New Delhi reciprocates with measured outreach, this moment can be converted into durable, institutionalized cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh police say student leader’s killers fled to India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963734/bangladesh-police-say-student-leaders-killers-fled-to-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh police on Sunday said the alleged killers of popular student leader&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962252&quot;&gt; Sharif Osman Hadi&lt;/a&gt; had fled to India, in comments likely to further strain relations with its neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi, a vocal India critic who took part in last year’s mass uprising, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961387&quot;&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier this month and later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928/wounded-leader-of-bangladesh-uprising-dies-in-singapore-hospital&quot;&gt;succumbed &lt;/a&gt;to his injuries at a hospital in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His death set off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962210&quot;&gt;violent protests &lt;/a&gt;with angry mobs torching several buildings, including two major newspapers deemed to favour India, as well as a prominent cultural institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With protests being held across the country almost daily, pressure has been growing on Bangladesh’s interim government to arrest the killers of Hadi, who was set to contest the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1928869&quot;&gt;general elections&lt;/a&gt; in February next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The killing was premeditated. Those behind it have been identified,” Nazrul Islam, a senior Dhaka Metropolitan Police officer, said at a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the suspects left Bangladesh through the Haluaghat border with India shortly after attacking Hadi on December 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were received at the border by two Indian citizens, who escorted them into the northeastern state of Meghalaya before handing them over to two accomplices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi investigators were in contact with their Indian counterparts, who had arrested the two suspected accomplices, Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are communicating with Meghalaya police, who have confirmed the arrest of two Indian nationals,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two senior Meghalaya police officers, however, did not comment when contacted by &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian foreign ministry had earlier said it rejects “false narratives” about New Delhi’s involvement in Hadi’s killing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ties between the neighbours have deteriorated since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ousted &lt;/a&gt;prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled the pro-democracy uprising and sought refuge in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India says it is still considering Dhaka’s requests to extradite Hasina, who was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; in absentia for orchestrating a deadly crackdown on the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962420/massive-crowd-attends-funeral-of-bangladesh-student-leader#:~:text=the%20violence%20this%20week%20also%20saw%20a%20Hindu%20garment%20worker%20killed%20following%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy&quot;&gt;lynching &lt;/a&gt;of a Hindu garment worker by a mob on December 18 has also hit ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the deteriorating security situation in the Muslim-majority country, Khuda Baksh Chowdhury, special assistant to interim leader Muhammad Yunus, overseeing the home department, stepped down on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dar hails Pakistan’s success in May conflict with India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963562/dar-hails-pakistans-success-in-may-conflict-with-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday hailed Pakistan’s success over India during the military escalation between the two countries earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A strong message was sent to the world,” he said while speaking to the media in Islamabad, where he gave an overview of Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our international standing has […] improved due to principled, proactive and result-oriented diplomacy,” Dar said, reflecting on the past year. He said Pakistan was “known to be a diplomatically isolated country” at the time PM Shehbaz Sharif took oath last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the May conflict, Dar said India’s claim of regional hegemony and being the net security provider was tested during the four-day escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We did not ask anyone to mediate between us,” the deputy premier asserted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recalled that Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials&quot;&gt;shot down&lt;/a&gt; seven &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1947213#:~:text=Lt%20Gen%20Chaudhry%20was%20quoted%20as%20saying%20that%20Pakistan%20had%20recently%20raised%20its%20tally%20of%20Indian%20aircraft%20shot%20down%20to%20seven&quot;&gt;jets&lt;/a&gt; of India during the May 7 air battle, which was followed by “incorrect” statements by New Delhi that Pakistan had attacked 15 Indian military installations. He also hailed the armed forces’ technology for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390&quot;&gt;intercepting&lt;/a&gt; 79 out of 80 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909385&quot;&gt;drones&lt;/a&gt; sent by India to Pakistan in 36 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minister pointed out that Pakistan had remained “proactively engaged” after both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1536224&quot;&gt;Pulwama&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source&quot;&gt;Pahalgam&lt;/a&gt; incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This time, their mala fide intentions regarding the Indus waters. They have been corresponding with Pakistan for the last 1.5-2 years on climate change that ‘ground realities have changed’,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailing the May events, Dar said the civil-military leadership led by PM Shehbaz “authorised” certain decisions in a meeting on the night of May 9. He said India then “made the mistake” of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909893&quot;&gt;attacking&lt;/a&gt; the Nur Khan Airbase in the early hours of May 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The process which had been authorised by the PM had to be implemented,” Dar said, but India made the “super mistake”, which then led to Pakistan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186&quot;&gt;retaliatory operation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After April 22, we used to have long hours. From [May] 6 to 10, we used to be here at night too,” the minister said, adding that he conducted over 60 phone calls with foreign dignitaries before May 6 and after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about India’s claims of Islamabad attacking it, Dar said: “I told one of the P5 countries that this is a digital world, it cannot be hidden … they called me back after 16-17 hours and told me we had not attacked anywhere in India. This was a first serious setback for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailing his exchanges with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Dar said, “At around 8:17am, I received a call from Secretary Rubio of USA that ‘India is ready to ceasefire, are you willing?’ I said ’we never wanted to go to war’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Within 45 minutes, I received a call from Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal. ‘Brother, I understand that you have authorised Secretary Rubio. Am I permitted to talk to India’ […] Prince Faisal said I will talk to the foreign minister of India and get back,” Dar recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that within an hour, the Saudi minister called him back and said he had also confirmed the ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been established that Pakistan’s armed forces, its technology and its capacity for defence is very solid. We only did in self-defence according to what was done to us; otherwise, it could have been much greater than this too,” the deputy PM said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Allah made [Pakistan] a nuclear power and a missile power. What you need now is economic power,” he stressed, highlighting that the country possessed great natural resources, such as mines and minerals, gas, and hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Related to Pahalgam and other incidents, our main analysis shared with everyone is that till the time the Jammu and Kashmir issue is not resolved, […] perpetual and permanent peace cannot be established in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreign minister reiterated Pakistan’s protest against India’s actions in occupied Kashmir, including “demographic changes and amendments in the Constitution”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dar noted that the May episode had revived the Kashmir issue at the international level, with the United Nations Security Council also discussing agendas related to human rights violations in India-occupied Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Indus Waters Treaty, Dar said the FO had actively engaged with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#ice-breaks-with-bangladesh&quot; id=&quot;ice-breaks-with-bangladesh&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ice breaks with Bangladesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deputy PM also highlighted that a “major ice-breaking breakthrough” occurred with Bangladesh as ties between the two nations revived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dar recalled that Hina Rabbani Khar had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/762773/bangladesh-seeks-pakistan-apology-for-1971-war-crimes&quot;&gt;visited Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, but there had been no engagement afterwards because of the “anti-Pakistan” government there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My 36-hour &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1935344&quot;&gt;visit to Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; was very engaging. I had meetings with the chief executive, the foreign minister and cabinet ministers and advisers,” he observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During my time there of 36 hours, I saw great gestures of goodwill for Pakistan,” Dar said, adding that Islamabad will proactively engage with Dhaka after the February polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan’s diplomacy during the crisis demonstrated our proactive approach and it showed our ability of transforming challenges into opportunities and our thought of effective narrative projection with principled engagement,” the minister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#positive-ties-with-us&quot; id=&quot;positive-ties-with-us&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Positive ties with US&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dar hailed the United States’ “proactive role” in the Pak-India ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is why on June 11, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514&quot;&gt;nominated&lt;/a&gt; [President Donald] Trump for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1947881&quot;&gt;Nobel Peace Prize 2026&lt;/a&gt;. The media had confusion on the date. I signed the letter on the authorisation of PM and sent it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Trump trumpeted the drum of May conflict success the most,” Dar quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Around 60 times, he reiterated that Pakistan shot down six fighter jets of India. Then he praised the prime minister and the field marshal. The relations with the US have started again towards a positive trajectory,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
