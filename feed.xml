      <description>Pakistan&amp;#8217;s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider expressed hope on Monday that direct flights between Karachi and Dhaka will start in January, during a meeting with the Chief Advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus. Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during Sheikh Hasina&amp;#8217;s rule. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, [&amp;#8230;]</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s Gen-Z party faces revolt over religious alliance, risking its future</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963946/bangladeshs-gen-z-party-faces-revolt-over-religious-alliance-risking-its-future</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Bangladeshi youth-driven party born out of the country’s 2024 uprising is facing an open revolt from within after sealing an election alliance with a religio-political group, a move analysts say could jeopardise its future and reinforce established parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 30 senior leaders of the National Citizen Party (NCP) have openly opposed its alliance with Jamaat-e-Islami, announced on Sunday, with several resigning in protest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Muslim-majority South Asian nation goes to the polls on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1960599&quot;&gt;February 12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before the deal, opinion polls had predicted Jamaat finishing a close second behind the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, while the NCP lagged far behind in third place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The NCP presented itself as a youth-driven alternative to traditional power structures. That identity is now under serious strain,” said H.M. Nazmul Alam, an academic. “Youth-based movements do not collapse only because they lose elections. They collapse when they lose clarity and internal unity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#alliance-for-greater-unity&quot; id=&quot;alliance-for-greater-unity&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Alliance for greater unity’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCP was formed earlier this year by leaders of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1846440&quot;&gt;protests &lt;/a&gt;that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief&quot;&gt;ousted &lt;/a&gt;long-time Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, forcing her to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief#:~:text=Hasina%20flees%20to%20India&quot;&gt;flee &lt;/a&gt;to India. Driven by Gen-Z activists born after the late 1990s, it says it aims to free the nation from decades of nepotism and the dominance of Hasina’s Awami League and the BNP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the Awami League banned, the vote will be effectively a direct contest between the BNP and Jamaat, which has trailed the other two in the past and had not been allowed to contest any elections since 2013 after a court said its registration as a political party conflicted with Bangladesh’s secular constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1855267&quot;&gt;revoked &lt;/a&gt;all the restrictions on Jamaat in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NCP’s struggle shows the challenges of turning street power into votes and holds lessons for neighbouring Nepal, where similar youth-led protests ousted the government this year and fresh elections are due in March, political analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCP chief Nahid Islam told a press conference late on Sunday that the recent &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928&quot;&gt;killing &lt;/a&gt;of 32-year-old Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in the uprising, forced his party to seek an alliance to keep at bay forces trying to derail the election through violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The dictatorship we overthrew is attempting to sabotage the election. Therefore, for the sake of greater unity, we have reached an electoral understanding with Jamaat, said Nahid, 27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was a majority decision within the party, but some may be opposed to it and they are free to take their own decisions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi was shot in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier in December while launching his election campaign as an independent candidate. Police say they have identified the killers but have not apprehended them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#your-centrist-idea-and-ideology-will-vanish&quot; id=&quot;your-centrist-idea-and-ideology-will-vanish&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Your centrist idea and ideology will vanish’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nahid earlier told Reuters his organisation was weak because it had not had enough time to build itself. It was also hampered by scarce funds and an unclear stance on key issues such as rights for women and minorities, Reuters reported in early December, citing party leaders who said alliance talks had been underway for some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One senior NCP leader to have resigned is Tasnim Jara, a doctor who left a career in Britain to join the party. She is now seeking the support of nearly 5,000 voters to be allowed to contest as an independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I promised you and the people of this country that I would fight for you and for building a new political culture,” she said on Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Whatever the circumstances, I am determined to keep that promise.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political analyst Asif Shahan, a professor at the University of Dhaka, said the NCP was “doomed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you go with Jamaat, it will help Jamaat, not you,” he said. “It will give them a liberal cover, and in return, you will become a force for the right. Your centrist idea and ideology - already poorly defined - will simply vanish.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh’s youth-driven National Citizen Party (NCP) is facing internal revolt after forming an election alliance with Islamist group Jamaat-e-Islami, a move that has sparked resignations and could undermine its credibility ahead of February 12 polls. At least 30 senior leaders openly opposed the decision, warning it risks eroding the party’s Gen-Z identity and core principles. [&amp;#8230;]</description>

    &lt;div class=&quot;content&quot;&gt;
                &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-subhead&quot;&gt;The ECHR asked the UK to justify stripping Shamima Begum of citizenship amid concerns that she was groomed and trafficked into Syria&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-main-image&quot;&gt;    
                  &lt;source height=&quot;915&quot; type=&quot;image/webp&quot; width=&quot;1400&quot; /&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-cutline&quot;&gt;Begum fled her East London home at the age of 15 to join the Islamic State (IS) group in Syria with two school friends (AFP) &lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-field-wide-photo-video&quot;&gt;Off&lt;/div&gt;
                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) has called on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/uk&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; government to explain its decision to strip a British woman of her citizenship after she fled to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/countries/syria&quot;&gt;Syria &lt;/a&gt;as a 15-year-old to join the Islamic State (IS) group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In late December, the Strasbourg court sent a series of questions to the British government, asking whether it broke anti-trafficking obligations when it stripped &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/uk-supreme-court-refuse-hear-shamima-begum-appeal&quot;&gt;Shamima Begum&lt;/a&gt; of her citizenship in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The questions include whether the government violated Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits slavery, servitude, forced labour, and a state’s duty to prevent and investigate trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former Home Secretary Sajid Javid stripped Begum of her citizenship on national security grounds after his office said that the deprivation was “conducive to the public good” and that not doing so posed a threat to the UK.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Javid also justified the decision to strip her British citizenship on the grounds that she qualified for a Bangladeshi passport through her parents’ heritage, despite never visiting or living in the South Asian country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begum made headlines when she fled to Syria in 2015 to join IS with two school friends from her East London home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She reappeared four years later after journalists tracked her down in IS territory. At the time, she was&amp;nbsp;heavily pregnant with a child who later passed away,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, Begum has tried and failed multiple times, to return to the UK and restore her citizenship in a series of legal battles with the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of those attempts have been successful and she continues to be held in a prison camp in northern Syria controlled by the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECHR is also assessing whether the Home Office failed to take into account whether she was a victim of trafficking, and if removing her citizenship could have stopped the government’s duty to investigate how she was allowed to leave the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Catalogue of failures&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her application to the Strasbourg court, Begum’s lawyers said that the UK authorities failed to ask four questions before depriving her of her citizenship, namely: whether she had been trafficked to Syria, whether British authorities failed to protect her, and whether her deprivation of citizenship would undermine any future investigation into potential trafficking, and if trafficking issues were present, whether deprivation could be justified on national-security grounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Birnberg Peirce Solicitors, which represents Begum, described the ECHR’s intervention as an “unprecedented opportunity” for the UK government to assess whether previous administrations ignored or sidestepped any considerations made to strip her of her citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Strasbourg’s communication presents an unprecedented opportunity for the UK as well as for Ms Begum - to grapple with the significant considerations raised in her case and ignored, sidestepped or violated up to now by previous UK administrations,” said Gareth Peirce, the lawyer representing Begum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is impossible to dispute that a 15-year-old British child was in 2014-15 lured, encouraged, and deceived for the purposes of sexual exploitation to leave home and travel to ISIL-controlled territory for the known purpose of being given, as a child, to an ISIL fighter to propagate children for the Islamic State.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“It is equally impossible not to acknowledge the catalogue of failures to protect a child known for weeks beforehand to be at high risk when a close friend had disappeared to Syria in an identical way and via an identical route.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The police failed to warn families, informed the school that its apprehension of risk was overstated, conducted no safeguarding measures, delayed contact with ports and known routes of travel to trigger alarms and prevent [them] reaching the known destination.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The UK Home Office did not respond to Middle East Eye’s request for comment at the time of writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Declan Morgan, the former lord chief justice of Ireland, said Britain &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/former-northern-irish-lord-chief-justice-says-uk-wrong-strip-shamima-begum-citizenship&quot;&gt;should not have stripped&lt;/a&gt; Begum of her British citizenship.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan, who serves as a a supplementary panel member of the UK Supreme Court, made the remarks&amp;nbsp; at the launch of a new&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/sweeping-uk-terror-law-label-harmful-behaviour-terrorism-prevent-overhaul&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by the Independent Commission on UK Counter-Terrorism Law, Policy and Practice, which he chairs.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020, the Special Immigration Appeals Court found that the conditions in the prison camp where Begum is being arbitrarily detained without trial constituted inhuman and degrading treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two years later, SIAC also found that the state failed to protect her but noted that its “hands were tied” as a result of the Supreme Court’s limiting the immigration court’s ability to take into consideration the merits of Begum’s case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ECHR’s intervention comes as activists ramp up their campaigning against the UK’s growing use of citizenship-stripping powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final judgement is expected at a later date, following submissions from the UK government and Begum’s lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Karachi-Dhaka flights likely from January, says Pakistan’s high commissioner</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963937/karachi-dhaka-flights-likely-from-january-says-pakistans-high-commissioner</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s High Commissioner to Bangladesh Imran Haider expressed hope on Monday that direct flights between Karachi and Dhaka will start in January, during a meeting with the Chief Advisor Professor Muhammad Yunus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relations between Pakistan and Bangladesh remained shaky during Sheikh Hasina’s rule. However, following the popular revolt against her government and her subsequent exile, relations between the two countries improved markedly, with Professor Muhammad Yunus leading the interim administration in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ChiefAdviserGoB/status/2005281898424381710&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During the meeting, both sides discussed ways to expand cooperation in trade, investment, and aviation, as well as scaling up cultural, educational, and medical exchanges to further strengthen bilateral relations between the two South Asian nations,” said a statement shared on X by Bangladesh’s interim leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haider, during the meeting, also noted that bilateral trade has recorded a 20 per cent growth compared to last year, with business communities from both countries actively exploring new investment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The high commissioner further highlighted a “significant increase” in cultural exchanges, adding that “Bangladeshi students have shown strong interest in higher education opportunities in Pakistan, particularly in medical sciences, nanotechnology, and artificial intelligence”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan has witnessed a rise in patients travelling to its leading hospitals for liver and kidney transplants,” said Islamabad’s envoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the statement, the high commissioner also stated that Pakistan was ready to offer “training and academic opportunities in transplantation-related medical fields”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement added that Bangladesh’s interim leader welcomed the “growing interactions between the two countries” and emphasised the “importance of increased visits, as well as cultural, educational, and people-to-people exchanges among SAARC member states.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Professor Yunus also underscored the need to further boost Bangladesh–Pakistan trade,” added the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus also expressed hope that during the current high commissioner’s tenure, both countries would “explore new avenues for investment and joint venture businesses“.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1936871/fm-dar-meets-bangladeshs-yunus-during-historic-visit-as-revitalising-saarc-comes-under-focus&quot;&gt;met&lt;/a&gt; with Professor Yunus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1935344&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;landmark visit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Dhaka, both countries stressed the need to revitalise regional cooperation through the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Office (FO) termed Dar’s two-day visit — the first by a Pakistani foreign minister to Bangladesh in 13 years — a “significant milestone” in the two countries’ relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paki­stan and Bangladesh had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1926083&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;agreed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to grant visa-free entry to holders of diplomatic and official passports from the other side a month before, when Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Tarique Rahman’s return to Bangladesh after 17 years in exile is essentially a stress test for a country struggling to rediscover the meaning of democratic choice.

      <title>US pledges $2B for UN humanitarian aid as Trump slashes funding and warns agencies to ‘adapt or die’</title>

                                        &lt;p&gt;GENEVA (AP) — The United States on Monday announced a $2 billion pledge for U.N. humanitarian aid as President Donald Trump’s administration continues to slash U.S. foreign assistance and warns United Nations agencies to “adapt, shrink or die” in a time of new financial realities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The money is a small fraction of what the U.S. has contributed in the past but reflects what the administration believes is a generous amount that will maintain the United States’ status as the world’s largest humanitarian donor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pledge creates an umbrella fund from which money will be doled out to individual agencies and priorities, a key part of U.S. demands for drastic changes across the world body that have alarmed many humanitarian workers and led to severe reductions in programs and services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $2 billion is only a sliver of traditional U.S. humanitarian funding for U.N.-backed programs, which has run as high as $17 billion annually in recent years, according to U.N. data. U.S. officials say only $8-$10 billion of that has been in voluntary contributions. The United States also pays billions in annual dues related to its U.N. membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say the Western aid cutbacks have been shortsighted, driven &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/world-food-program-hunger-trump-afghanistan-congo-somalia-sudan-3271c01a60128ae54e4ff4867b904826&quot;&gt;millions toward hunger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, displacement or disease, and harmed &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-china-foreign-aid-global-influence-d7f3ac76dcbf7c9b75e7b147d8d8fcb6&quot;&gt;U.S. soft power&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
    
    
        
            
                
    
    &lt;a id=&quot;html-embed-module-e30000&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;


    
    &lt;p&gt;
        
    &lt;/p&gt;

            
        
    
    
&lt;h2&gt;A year of crisis in aid&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move caps a crisis year for many U.N. organizations like its refugee, migration and food aid agencies. The Trump administration has &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/unhcr-trump-iom-ocha-unaids-world-health-organization-d5372e0193c720b55b88db7dcd1c7f0a&quot;&gt;already cut billions in U.S. foreign aid&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, prompting them to slash spending, aid projects and thousands of jobs. Other traditional Western donors have reduced outlays, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announced U.S. pledge for aid programs of the United Nations — the world’s top provider of humanitarian assistance and biggest recipient of U.S. humanitarian aid money — takes shape in a preliminary deal with the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, run by Tom Fletcher, a former British diplomat and government official. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;Even as the U.S. pulls back its aid, needs have ballooned across the world: Famine has been recorded this year in parts of conflict-ridden &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/sudan-famine-darfur-ipc-elfasher-e4816f40ac2b2852b0b70c85e8f741d1&quot;&gt;Sudan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/gaza-famine-hunger-israel-ceasefire-a5f88e20db2a5c4f754117de9bdada69&quot;&gt;Gaza&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, and floods, drought and natural disasters that many scientists attribute to climate change have taken many lives or driven thousands from their homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cuts will have major implications for U.N. affiliates like the &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/iom-migration-us-aid-cuts-humanitarian-migrants-61cdf8c96a0a26211a2c8cd5042a44d1&quot;&gt;International Organization for Migration&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, the World Food Program and refugee agency UNHCR. They have already received billions less from the U.S. this year than under annual allocations from the previous Biden administration — or even during Trump’s first term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the idea is that Fletcher’s office — which last year set in motion a “humanitarian reset” to improve efficiency, accountability and effectiveness of money spent — will become a funnel for U.S. and other aid money that can be then redirected to those agencies, rather than scattered U.S. contributions to a variety of individual appeals for aid. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;h2&gt;US seeks aid consolidation&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States wants to see “more consolidated leadership authority” in U.N. aid delivery systems, said a senior State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity to provide details before the announcement at the U.S. diplomatic mission in Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the plan, Fletcher and his coordination office “are going to control the spigot” on how money is distributed to agencies, the official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This humanitarian reset at the United Nations should deliver more aid with fewer tax dollars — providing more focused, results-driven assistance aligned with U.S foreign policy,” said U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Michael Waltz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials say the $2 billion is just a first outlay to help fund OCHA’s annual appeal for money, announced earlier this month. Fletcher, noting the upended aid landscape, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/un-switzerland-humanitarian-aid-ocha-funding-e764d76f3a5adcd861899a3b0be66ab3&quot;&gt;already slashed the request this year&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. Other traditional U.N. donors like Britain, France, Germany and Japan have reduced aid allocations and sought reforms this year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The agreement requires the U.N. to consolidate humanitarian functions to reduce bureaucratic overhead, unnecessary duplication, and ideological creep,” the State Department said in a statement. “Individual U.N. agencies will need to adapt, shrink, or die.” &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;“Nowhere is reform more important than the humanitarian agencies, which perform some of the U.N.’s most critical work,” the department added. “Today’s agreement is a critical step in those reform efforts, balancing President Trump’s commitment to remaining the world’s most generous nation, with the imperative to bring reform to the way we fund, oversee, and integrate with U.N. humanitarian efforts.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its core, the reform project will help establish pools of funding that can be directed either to specific crises or countries in need. A total of 17 countries will be targeted initially, including Bangladesh, Congo, Haiti, Syria and Ukraine. &lt;/p&gt;
    
        
    

&lt;p&gt;One of the world’s most desperate countries, Afghanistan, is not included, nor are the Palestinian territories, which officials say will be covered by money stemming from Trump’s as-yet-incomplete Gaza peace plan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, months in the making, stems from Trump’s longtime view that the world body has great promise, but has failed to live up to it, and has — in his eyes — drifted too far from its original mandate to save lives while undermining American interests, promoting radical ideologies and encouraging wasteful, unaccountable spending. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fletcher praised the deal, saying in a statement, “At a moment of immense global strain, the United States is demonstrating that it is a humanitarian superpower, offering hope to people who have lost everything.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;___&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee reported from Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh’s National Citizen Party: ‘new hope’ that looks like the old guard</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963842/bangladeshs-national-citizen-party-new-hope-that-looks-like-the-old-guard</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;THE National Citizen Party (NCP) was born with a claim that it would not practise politics as usual. Emerging from the July uprising, it asked people to see it as a break from Bangladesh’s old habits of convenience and compromise. It promised to distinguish itself with its own political language and its own sense of responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two developments have turned speculation into a moment of reckoning. Tasnim Jara, a senior and one of the more visible leaders, in her own right, resigned from the party. She announced she would contest the Dhaka-9 constituency as an independent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, 30 members of the party’s central committee have formally written to Convener Nahid Islam, opposing any political alliance or seat-sharing arrangement with Jamaat-i-Islami. It has now become a question of credibility for the NCP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seat-sharing is not unusual in Bangladesh. Elections are fought one constituency at a time and depend on organisation, polling agents and the ability to protect votes. New parties struggle because these structures take years to build. Seat sharing arrangements or alliance might make sense for electoral politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the NCP did not enter politics asking to be judged by that standard alone. From the outset, it framed itself as the political expression of a movement that rejected the logic of a deal that “works”. Its leaders, shaped by the July uprising, spoke against shortcuts, against recycling old alignments, and against moral ambiguity. They spoke of a new arrangement, ‘Naya Bondobosto’ as they kept harping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That positioning mattered. It is why many young people, first-time participants and politically unaffiliated citizens placed their trust in the party. What has changed since then? If the NCP has reassessed its strength and concluded that contesting independently is not viable in this election cycle, it should say so plainly. Admitting organisational limits would not weaken the party. It would demonstrate seriousness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any understanding with Jamaat-i-Islami also carries a weight far beyond seat numbers. Jamaat’s opposition to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1704822&quot;&gt;independence in 1971&lt;/a&gt; and its role during the Liberation War are not fringe allegations. They are part of Bangladesh’s mainstream political history. That history has shaped alliances, exclusions and public trust for decades. It cannot be set aside through electoral arithmetic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tasnim Jara’s decision brings this tension into sharp focus. In announcing her independent candidacy on Facebook, she openly acknowledged the disadvantages of running without party infrastructure, an organised worker base, or institutional access to security and administration. Yet she chose that path, citing her commitment to a new political culture and the promise she had made to voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The central committee letter makes the issue impossible to dismiss as personal dissent. The 30 signatories invoke the NCP’s declared ideology, the historical responsibility of the July uprising and democratic ethics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They explicitly cite Jamaat’s political history, particularly its role in 1971, as incompatible with the party’s values. They also warn of immediate consequences, saying that even reports of a possible alliance have already led supporters and organisers to reconsider their backing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money adds another layer of accountability. The NCP presented itself as a citizen-funded alternative to patronage politics. Crowdfunding is not merely a financial tool. It is a political contract. Many of those contributors are uncomfortable with Jamaat’s history and politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the party now moves in a direction that contradicts the assumptions under which that money was raised, the cost will extend beyond this election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Warnings have also come from within the wider July movement. Abdul Kader, a former coordinator associated with the uprising, has cautioned publicly that an NCP–Jamaat understanding risks damaging the future of youth politics. That concern reflects a fear that a rare moment of political clarity is being traded for short-term opportunism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the NCP believes reform is impossible without parliamentary seats, it should say so. If it believes contesting independently is not viable this time, it should explain why. If it believes seat-sharing with Jamaat does not dilute its core commitments, it must articulate those commitments clearly and draw its red lines.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Student leader’s killing continues to drive Bangladesh unrest</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963867/student-leaders-killing-continues-to-drive-bangladesh-unrest</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Inqilab Moncho-led demos held across key highways in Dhaka, other major cities&lt;br /&gt;• Official says charge sheet to be filed within 10 days&lt;br /&gt;• Suspects ‘fled to India’: police&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Inqilab Moncho and allied groups staged simultaneous blockades across major highways and intersections in various cities across Bangladesh on Sunday, demanding justice for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962210&quot;&gt;killing&lt;/a&gt; of student leader Sharif Osman Hadi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi, a vocal critic of India who took part in last year’s mass uprising, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961387&quot;&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier this month and later succumbed to his injuries at a hospital in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities hit by the protests included Dhaka, Chattogram, Rajshahi, Gazipur, Barishal, Cumilla and Khulna.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaders and activists of Inqilab Moncho blocked the Shahbagh intersection in Dhaka for the third consecutive day on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Statements from the administration are nothing but eyewash. They are simply trying to waste time. The perpetrators could have been arrested on the very day the shooting happened,” said Naim Islam, a central member of Inqilab Moncho.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The government must disclose to the public who is pressuring whom. They claim some people have been arrested, but the real killer must be brought to justice,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The interim government is determined to ensure justice for the [Hadi’s] killing,” he said, adding that police, Border Guard Bangladesh, Rapid Action Battalion, and intelligence agencies were working closely and in coordination to uncover the facts behind the murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pressure has been mounting on Bangladesh’s interim government to arrest the killers of Hadi, who was set to contest the general elections in February next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s home adviser, retired Lt Gen Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, said investigators were expected to submit the charge sheet in the popular student leader’s murder case within 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said authorities had made significant progress, but not everything could be disclosed at the moment to protect the integrity of the investigation and to identify both the perpetrators and those who backed them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said 11 people have so far been arrested in the case, including the wife and parents of the alleged mastermind, Faisal Karim Masud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the arrestees, six gave confessional statements under Section 164, while four witnesses also gave statements under the same provision, the adviser said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on information from the arrestees, witness statements, reviews of recovered evidence and an overall assessment, the investigation is now in its final stage, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I request everyone to remain patient,” he said, adding that a decision had already been made to transfer the case to a speedy trial tribunal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I want to assure you that the trial in the Hadi murder case will be completed within the tenure of the current interim government.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘Fled to India’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; quoted Bangladesh police as saying that Hadi’s suspected killers had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963734&quot;&gt;fled&lt;/a&gt; to India, in comments likely to further strain relations with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The killing was premeditated. Those behind it have been identified,” Nazrul Islam, a senior Dhaka Metropolitan Police officer, said at a news conference He added that the suspects left Bangladesh through the Haluaghat border on Dec 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were received at the border by two Indian citizens, who escorted them into the northeastern state of Meghalaya before handing them over to two accomplices.” Bangladeshi investigators were in contact with their Indian counterparts, who had arrested the two suspected accomplices, Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PTI will use protests to push govt for talks: Afridi</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963862/pti-will-use-protests-to-push-govt-for-talks-afridi</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• KP CM says dialogue without ‘resistance’ not effective; Karachi his ‘next destination’&lt;br /&gt;• Believes talks can be meaningful if ‘power-wielding individuals’ participate&lt;br /&gt;• Azma claims ‘street movement’ failed to attract public, dubs it ‘social media hype’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: After spending three days in the provincial capital &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963371&quot;&gt;galvanising&lt;/a&gt; party supporters, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Min­ister Sohail Afridi said the PTI would not engage in talks with the government without first taking to the streets to demonstrate its opposition to the status quo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His remarks come as party leaders are split into two camps: one led by veterans favouring dialogue, while the other is bent on street agitation as per the directions of the incarcerated founder, Imran Khan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day earlier, CM Afridi said the decision to initiate talks rested with the opposition alliance, and that he was in charge of the ‘street movement’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CM Afridi, along with other provincial ministers and members of the assembly, had arrived in Lahore to launch a new street movement, as per the directives of Imran Khan. He left the provincial capital in the evening. Before Afridi, his predecessor, Ali Amin Gandapur, also came to Lahore earlier this year, ostensibly to launch a protest drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Mr Afridi told journalists at a meeting that reconciliation was impossible without resistance. “We will be at a loss if we enter into dialogue without resistance. So, the protest movement will continue until the rulers come to the table after recognising the opposition as an equal partner,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to a question whether the party had perpetually been protesting without any result, CM Afridi said, “This time, we will not make tall claims but do practical work and come up with a positive output.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharing his thoughts about the dialogue &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962792/if-they-are-ready-govt-is-definitely-ready-pm-shehbaz-reiterates-offer-for-dialogue-with-opposition&quot;&gt;offered&lt;/a&gt; by the government, the CM claimed there must have been some ‘direction’ from the powers that be to the PM that he offered talks. He said talks could be meaningful only after inclusion of individuals who wielded power and influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We could not develop a working relationship with the establishment because they did not accept my policy and I could not accept their policy,” he said in response to a question about him reaching out to the powerful quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The establishment now knows that the incumbent rulers were unable to take Pakistan forward,” he said, while accusing the ruling parties of corruption and economic mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Afridi said it was not necessary that the PTI pick D-Chowk in Islamabad as its protest site, as it did in November last year, adding that it was also not important to end the protest after a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an X post, the CM also announced his intention of visiting Karachi for the ‘street movement’.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SohailAfridiISF/status/2005299736509837401&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, meanwhile, said no political party could go into a blind alley. “We are seeing that the government wants the PTI to neither speak about its election fraud, the release of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, nor question institutions’ interference in politics and journalism. Then what should we do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr Raja said reconciliation and dialogue could only begin when the “basic principles” would be agreed — otherwise the party would take to the streets to get these principles accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting with journalists, CM Afridi was stopped from entering the Lahore cantonment area, where he had plans to meet the families of incarcerated former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and advocate Hassaan Niazi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KP CM said he had been stopped as they had made (cantonement) a no-go area. “I have asked whether Pakistan’s territory ended here and another country’s land started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Punjab government should not have behaved in such a harsh manner with the chief minister of a province. This has all been happening with me for the past three consecutive days,” he lamented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The KP CM is also ready to go without his gunmen and KP police, but is still not being allowed,” Salman Akram Raja said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azma ridicules PTI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari ridiculed the PTI’s street movement, saying its reality was “exposed in daylight after social media hype overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement on X, Ms Bokhari quipped that PTI supporters were celebrating by sharing images of Bangladesh since last night, claiming that the so-called street movement failed to attract any public response during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AzmaBokhariPMLN/status/2005233578763038959&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said there was no one even to respond to the slogans raised by the protesters. Taking a jibe at the demonstrators, she said they had “toured the ‘Europe of Pakistan,’ Lahore, enough under heavy protocol” and should now return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Please, let Lahore breathe in peace,” she said, adding that PTI leaders should go back and address the issues of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead. She urged PTI to focus on public welfare in its own province rather than staging what she termed ineffective protests elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amjad Mahmood also contributed to this report&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladesh claims murder suspects of radical leader Sharif Osman Hadi have fled to Meghalaya, India. However, Indian security agencies, including the BSF and Meghalaya DGP, have strongly refuted these allegations, stating there is no evidence of any fugitive crossing the border.

      <description>A proposed electoral alliance between Bangladesh&apos;s National Citizen Party and Jamaat-e-Islami is causing divisions. Thirty NCP leaders have protested, citing Jamaat&apos;s controversial past including its role in the 1971 Liberation War. This move comes as seat-sharing talks near completion. Some NCP leaders previously belonged to Jamaat&apos;s student wing. Jamaat sought partnership with NCP over the BNP.</description>

      <title>Party would move towards dialogue after ensuring level-playing field provided through street movement: PTI</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963737/party-would-move-towards-dialogue-after-ensuring-level-playing-field-provided-through-street-movement-pti</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The PTI on Sunday denied opting to engage in dialogue with the government as an underdog but said that it will do so “after ensuring a level-playing field is provided to it through street movements“, according to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi and the PTI Secretary-General, Salman Akram Raja.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CM Afridi, along with other provincial ministers and members of the assembly, was in Lahore to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963371&quot;&gt;launch&lt;/a&gt; a new street movement, as per the directives of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan. He left for the motorway at about 6:40pm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a discussion with senior journalists at a private residence in Lahore’s Defence Housing Authority earlier in the day, Afridi asserted that reconciliation was impossible without resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We will be at a loss if we enter into dialogue without resistance. So, the protest movement will continue until the rulers come to the table after recognising the opposition as an equal partner,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to a question whether the party had perpetually been protesting without yielding any result, CM Afridi said, “This time, we will not make tall claims but do practical work and come up with a positive output.“&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary-General Raja said no political party could go into a blind alley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are seeing that the government want the PTI to neither speak about its election fraud, the release of incarcerated party founder Imran Khan, nor question institutions’ interference in politics and journalism. Then what should we do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raja said reconciliation and dialogue could only begin when the “basic principles” would be agreed – otherwise the party would take to the streets to get these principles accepted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting with journalists, CM Afridi visited the residences of party leaders Mirza Afridi, but was stopped from entering the Lahore cantonment area, where he had plans to meet the families of incarcerated former Punjab governor Omar Sarfraz Cheema and advocate Hassan Niazi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The KP CM said he had been stopped as they had made (cantonement) a no-go area. “I have asked whether Pakistan’s territory ended here and another country’s land started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Punjab government should not have behaved in such a harsh manner with the chief minister of a province. This has all been happening with me for the past three consecutive days,” he lamented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I have been asking to go to the party leaders’ residences in the cantonment but was told that I was not permitted,” he said and demanded that he be given a reason “in writing” as to why he was stopped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The KP CM is also ready to go without his gunmen and KP police, but is still not being allowed,” Salman Akram Raja said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962792/if-they-are-ready-govt-is-definitely-ready-pm-shehbaz-reiterates-offer-for-dialogue-with-opposition&quot;&gt;offered&lt;/a&gt; talks with the opposition but also emphasised that dialogue between the two sides could only proceed on “legitimate matters”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#street-movement-failed-to-attract-public-azma&quot; id=&quot;street-movement-failed-to-attract-public-azma&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Street movement failed to attract public’: Azma&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, Punjab Information Minister, Azma Bokhari, ridiculed the PTI’s street movement, saying its reality was “exposed in daylight after social media hype overnight.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/AzmaBokhariPMLN/status/2005233578763038959&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a statement on X, Bokhari remarked that PTI supporters were celebrating by sharing images of Bangladesh since last night, claiming that the so-called street movement failed to attract any public response during the day.&lt;br /&gt;She said there was no one even to respond to the slogans raised by the protesters. Taking a jibe at the demonstrators, Bokhari said they had “toured the ‘Europe of Pakistan,’ Lahore, enough under heavy protocol” and should now return.&lt;br /&gt;“Please, let Lahore breathe in peace,” she said, adding that PTI leaders should go back and address the issues of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead.&lt;br /&gt;She urged PTI to focus on public welfare in its own province rather than staging what she termed ineffective protests elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Sikh activists clash with Hindu protesters outside Bangladeshi High Commission in London</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963739/sikh-activists-clash-with-hindu-protesters-outside-bangladeshi-high-commission-in-london</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;LONDON: A demonstration outside the Bangladeshi High Commission in London on Saturday briefly turned tense when pro-Khalistan Sikh activists and a small group of Hindu protesters confronted each other, prompting police intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Khalistan Movement wants an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1776744#:~:text=wants%20an%20independent%20Sikh%20state%20carved%20out%20of%20India%20and%20dates%20back%20to%20India%20and%20Pakistan%E2%80%99s%20independence%20in%201947%20when%20the%20idea%20was%20pushed%20forward%20in%20negotiations%20preceding%20the%20partition%20of%20the%20Punjab%20region%20between%20the%20two%20new%20countries.&quot;&gt;independent Sikh state&lt;/a&gt; carved out of India and dates back to India and Pakistan’s independence in 1947, when the idea was pushed forward in negotiations preceding the partition of the Punjab region between the two new countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protest was held in connection with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808#:~:text=lynching%20of%20a%20Hindu%20man%20over%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy.&quot;&gt;reports of violence&lt;/a&gt; against Hindus in Bangladesh. During the gathering, Paramjeet Singh Pamma, identified by organisers as a coordinator of the Khalistan Referendum campaign, was involved in a brief scuffle with an Indian Hindu protester.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metropolitan Police officers on duty intervened quickly, separating the individuals and dispersing the groups from close proximity to the mission building. No injuries were reported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/SFJ_US_Official/status/2004947498058531220&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the incident, pro-Khalistan Sikh protesters formed a cordon near the embassy entrance and continued their demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They raised political slogans, accusing the Indian government of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1918029&quot;&gt;involvement&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1831329&quot;&gt;killings &lt;/a&gt;of Hardeep Singh Nijjar and others. Police maintained a presence to prevent further confrontation and said the situation was brought under control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India has designated Pamma as a “most wanted terrorist” — a charge he and his supporters reject. He currently resides in the United Kingdom. UK authorities have not announced any charges against him, and previous Indian requests related to his extradition have not resulted in court action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Metropolitan Police did not issue any immediate statement on arrests or further action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nijjar was &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jun/20/advocate-separate-sikh-state-india-shot-dead-canada-hardeep-singh-nijjar-temple&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;shot dead&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at the age of 45 by masked gunmen outside the temple he presided over after being wanted by Indian authorities for alleged terrorism offences and conspiracy to commit murder — accusations he denied. His murder in June 2023 near his home in Vancouver sparked a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1865190&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;diplomatic storm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between India and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, in November 2023, US authorities &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1791573&quot;&gt;thwarted &lt;/a&gt;a plot to kill Sikh separatist Gurpatwant Singh Pannun in the United States and issued a warning to India over concerns the government in New Delhi was involved, the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times (FT)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.ft.com/content/56f7d6d6-6a93-4172-a49e-d8a91991e29d&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;reported.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, an Indian intelligence official and an Indian national &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1866009&quot;&gt;indicted &lt;/a&gt;for their role in the plot to kill Pannun, according to the US Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in March this year, India asked the US to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1898726&quot;&gt;list &lt;/a&gt;Sikhs For Justice, a separatist group, as a terrorist organisation — a point that came up during talks between Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and visiting US national intelligence chief Tulsi Gabbard.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For now, Rahman’s return is a consequential fact: it reshapes domestic dynamics and reframes the bilateral conversation at a critical moment in Bangladesh’s political calendar. If New Delhi reciprocates with measured outreach, this moment can be converted into durable, institutionalized cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh police say student leader’s killers fled to India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963734/bangladesh-police-say-student-leaders-killers-fled-to-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh police on Sunday said the alleged killers of popular student leader&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962252&quot;&gt; Sharif Osman Hadi&lt;/a&gt; had fled to India, in comments likely to further strain relations with its neighbour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hadi, a vocal India critic who took part in last year’s mass uprising, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961387&quot;&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; by masked assailants in Dhaka earlier this month and later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928/wounded-leader-of-bangladesh-uprising-dies-in-singapore-hospital&quot;&gt;succumbed &lt;/a&gt;to his injuries at a hospital in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His death set off &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962210&quot;&gt;violent protests &lt;/a&gt;with angry mobs torching several buildings, including two major newspapers deemed to favour India, as well as a prominent cultural institution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With protests being held across the country almost daily, pressure has been growing on Bangladesh’s interim government to arrest the killers of Hadi, who was set to contest the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1928869&quot;&gt;general elections&lt;/a&gt; in February next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The killing was premeditated. Those behind it have been identified,” Nazrul Islam, a senior Dhaka Metropolitan Police officer, said at a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that the suspects left Bangladesh through the Haluaghat border with India shortly after attacking Hadi on December 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They were received at the border by two Indian citizens, who escorted them into the northeastern state of Meghalaya before handing them over to two accomplices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi investigators were in contact with their Indian counterparts, who had arrested the two suspected accomplices, Islam said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are communicating with Meghalaya police, who have confirmed the arrest of two Indian nationals,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two senior Meghalaya police officers, however, did not comment when contacted by &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian foreign ministry had earlier said it rejects “false narratives” about New Delhi’s involvement in Hadi’s killing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ties between the neighbours have deteriorated since &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ousted &lt;/a&gt;prime minister Sheikh Hasina fled the pro-democracy uprising and sought refuge in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India says it is still considering Dhaka’s requests to extradite Hasina, who was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; in absentia for orchestrating a deadly crackdown on the uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962420/massive-crowd-attends-funeral-of-bangladesh-student-leader#:~:text=the%20violence%20this%20week%20also%20saw%20a%20Hindu%20garment%20worker%20killed%20following%20allegations%20of%20blasphemy&quot;&gt;lynching &lt;/a&gt;of a Hindu garment worker by a mob on December 18 has also hit ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amid the deteriorating security situation in the Muslim-majority country, Khuda Baksh Chowdhury, special assistant to interim leader Muhammad Yunus, overseeing the home department, stepped down on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Indian and Bangladeshi ​​Hindus were outside the Bangladesh High Commission in London on Saturday when a handful of Khalistanis showed up outside in support of Bangladesh. Shattered by horrific lynchings of Dipu Chandra Das and Amrit Mondal, trapped and persecuted Hindus in Bangladesh are sending out an SOS to India to open the borders to escape Islamist mob fury.</description>

      <title>Growing Islamic Fundamentalism In Bangladesh: A Security Challenge For India</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/growing-islamic-fundamentalism-bangladesh-security-challenge-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yunus’s actions increasingly reflect the anti-India agenda of pro-Pakistan fundamentalists. This is illustrated by a book he recently presented to a visiting Canadian delegation - its cover featured a map of Bangladesh appearing to encompass large parts of India’s northeast—a symbolic gesture aimed at globalising the anti-India narrative.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dar hails Pakistan’s success in May conflict with India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963562/dar-hails-pakistans-success-in-may-conflict-with-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Saturday hailed Pakistan’s success over India during the military escalation between the two countries earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A strong message was sent to the world,” he said while speaking to the media in Islamabad, where he gave an overview of Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our international standing has […] improved due to principled, proactive and result-oriented diplomacy,” Dar said, reflecting on the past year. He said Pakistan was “known to be a diplomatically isolated country” at the time PM Shehbaz Sharif took oath last year.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the May conflict, Dar said India’s claim of regional hegemony and being the net security provider was tested during the four-day escalation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We did not ask anyone to mediate between us,” the deputy premier asserted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He recalled that Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1908824/pakistan-downs-5-indian-jets-as-retaliation-for-late-night-strikes-at-6-sites-officials&quot;&gt;shot down&lt;/a&gt; seven &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1947213#:~:text=Lt%20Gen%20Chaudhry%20was%20quoted%20as%20saying%20that%20Pakistan%20had%20recently%20raised%20its%20tally%20of%20Indian%20aircraft%20shot%20down%20to%20seven&quot;&gt;jets&lt;/a&gt; of India during the May 7 air battle, which was followed by “incorrect” statements by New Delhi that Pakistan had attacked 15 Indian military installations. He also hailed the armed forces’ technology for &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909390&quot;&gt;intercepting&lt;/a&gt; 79 out of 80 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909385&quot;&gt;drones&lt;/a&gt; sent by India to Pakistan in 36 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The minister pointed out that Pakistan had remained “proactively engaged” after both the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1536224&quot;&gt;Pulwama&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1905917/at-least-24-killed-in-occupied-kashmir-gunmen-attack-on-tourists-police-source&quot;&gt;Pahalgam&lt;/a&gt; incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This time, their mala fide intentions regarding the Indus waters. They have been corresponding with Pakistan for the last 1.5-2 years on climate change that ‘ground realities have changed’,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailing the May events, Dar said the civil-military leadership led by PM Shehbaz “authorised” certain decisions in a meeting on the night of May 9. He said India then “made the mistake” of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1909893&quot;&gt;attacking&lt;/a&gt; the Nur Khan Airbase in the early hours of May 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The process which had been authorised by the PM had to be implemented,” Dar said, but India made the “super mistake”, which then led to Pakistan’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910186&quot;&gt;retaliatory operation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After April 22, we used to have long hours. From [May] 6 to 10, we used to be here at night too,” the minister said, adding that he conducted over 60 phone calls with foreign dignitaries before May 6 and after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking about India’s claims of Islamabad attacking it, Dar said: “I told one of the P5 countries that this is a digital world, it cannot be hidden … they called me back after 16-17 hours and told me we had not attacked anywhere in India. This was a first serious setback for them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Detailing his exchanges with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Dar said, “At around 8:17am, I received a call from Secretary Rubio of USA that ‘India is ready to ceasefire, are you willing?’ I said ’we never wanted to go to war’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Within 45 minutes, I received a call from Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal. ‘Brother, I understand that you have authorised Secretary Rubio. Am I permitted to talk to India’ […] Prince Faisal said I will talk to the foreign minister of India and get back,” Dar recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that within an hour, the Saudi minister called him back and said he had also confirmed the ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It has been established that Pakistan’s armed forces, its technology and its capacity for defence is very solid. We only did in self-defence according to what was done to us; otherwise, it could have been much greater than this too,” the deputy PM said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Allah made [Pakistan] a nuclear power and a missile power. What you need now is economic power,” he stressed, highlighting that the country possessed great natural resources, such as mines and minerals, gas, and hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Related to Pahalgam and other incidents, our main analysis shared with everyone is that till the time the Jammu and Kashmir issue is not resolved, […] perpetual and permanent peace cannot be established in the region.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The foreign minister reiterated Pakistan’s protest against India’s actions in occupied Kashmir, including “demographic changes and amendments in the Constitution”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dar noted that the May episode had revived the Kashmir issue at the international level, with the United Nations Security Council also discussing agendas related to human rights violations in India-occupied Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the Indus Waters Treaty, Dar said the FO had actively engaged with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#ice-breaks-with-bangladesh&quot; id=&quot;ice-breaks-with-bangladesh&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Ice breaks with Bangladesh&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deputy PM also highlighted that a “major ice-breaking breakthrough” occurred with Bangladesh as ties between the two nations revived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dar recalled that Hina Rabbani Khar had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/762773/bangladesh-seeks-pakistan-apology-for-1971-war-crimes&quot;&gt;visited Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; in 2012, but there had been no engagement afterwards because of the “anti-Pakistan” government there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My 36-hour &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1935344&quot;&gt;visit to Bangladesh&lt;/a&gt; was very engaging. I had meetings with the chief executive, the foreign minister and cabinet ministers and advisers,” he observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During my time there of 36 hours, I saw great gestures of goodwill for Pakistan,” Dar said, adding that Islamabad will proactively engage with Dhaka after the February polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan’s diplomacy during the crisis demonstrated our proactive approach and it showed our ability of transforming challenges into opportunities and our thought of effective narrative projection with principled engagement,” the minister said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#positive-ties-with-us&quot; id=&quot;positive-ties-with-us&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Positive ties with US&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dar hailed the United States’ “proactive role” in the Pak-India ceasefire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That is why on June 11, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1918514&quot;&gt;nominated&lt;/a&gt; [President Donald] Trump for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1947881&quot;&gt;Nobel Peace Prize 2026&lt;/a&gt;. The media had confusion on the date. I signed the letter on the authorisation of PM and sent it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Trump trumpeted the drum of May conflict success the most,” Dar quipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Around 60 times, he reiterated that Pakistan shot down six fighter jets of India. Then he praised the prime minister and the field marshal. The relations with the US have started again towards a positive trajectory,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>ADR falls to 35pc, IDR goes up to 100pc</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963500/adr-falls-to-35pc-idr-goes-up-to-100pc</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Report finds lending to private sector lowest in Pakistan&lt;br /&gt;• Undocumented economy is 40pc of GDP&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KARACHI: The advances to deposits ratio (ADR) further declined from 50 per cent in December 2024 to just 35pc as of June this year, while the investments to deposits ratio (IDR) surged from 90pc to 100pc during the same period, according to a report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Banking Publication 2025 titled “Banking Forward: Journeying Towards Future Horizons” &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.pwc.com.pk/en/&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; by PwC-A.F. Ferguson on Friday said Pakistan’s ADR remains significantly lower than Bang­la­desh at 87pc, India at 79pc and Sri Lanka at 59pc. In contrast, Pakistan’s IDR of 100pc is much higher than Bangladesh at 29pc, India at 33pc and Sri Lanka at 47pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the report, priority sector financing continues to remain at sub-optimal levels, with SME contribution to total loans at 3.7pc and agriculture at 4pc. In comparison, SME lending as a percentage of total loans is considerably higher in other countries, including Indonesia at 19pc, Bangladesh at 17pc and India at 16pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, lending to the private sector declined to 11pc of GDP in 2024. Con­versely, the IDR has increased sharply, rising from 40pc in 2010 to 93pc in 2024 and reaching 100pc as of June 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the report, SMEs and the agriculture sector are central to Pakistan’s economy, together representing millions of enterprises across both formal and informal segments. Agriculture contributes 24pc to GDP, while SMEs account for 40pc of GDP, 90pc of enterprises, 30pc of export earnings and employ nearly 30pc of the workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Agricultural borrowers increased by 200,000, reaching 2.9 million by June 2025, while SME borrowers rose by over 55pc to 277,000 during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report said industry experts emphasised that a large share of Pakistan’s transactions remains cash-based, contributing to an undocumented economy estimated at 40pc of GDP. Digitising a portion of these transactions could save Rs164 billion annually, while reducing the undocumented economy by 25pc has the potential to unlock over Rs1 trillion in resources, the report added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of June 2025, agricultural financing rose to Rs739bn, accounting for 5.2pc of total loans, up from 3.4pc in December 2024. SME lending increased to Rs712bn, representing 5pc of total loans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent initiatives by the regulator and the industry have led to notable progress, with financing to priority sectors surpassing 10pc of total loans, indicating a reversal of historical declining trends. “Despite this positive trend, financing levels remain low compared to regional peers, highlighting the need for expanded credit interventions,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts also emphasised the need for sustained fiscal discipline, comprehensive tax reforms, improved governance of state-owned enterprises and reduced government debt to maintain and strengthen economic progress, according to the report. “The urgent need to diversify and expand exports has been stressed upon, advocating a shift from consumption-driven growth to a value-added export base,” it added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts further highlighted that boosting domestic investment and productivity is critical for successful import substitution, which requires removing bureaucra­tic hurdles, simplifying regulations and cre­­ating an investor-friendly environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cash continues to pose a challenge to financial inclusion and digitisation, with Pakistan’s cash-in-circulation ratio at 34pc, compared to Bangladesh at 16pc, India at 15pc and Kenya at 9pc, the report noted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Pakistan, paper-based transactions account for 14pc of total transactions, while ATM traffic constitutes 25pc of e-transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is greater need for broader government and regulatory push to create a wider ecosystem that incentivises digital and disincentivises cash,” the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report added that the State Bank of Pakistan’s instant payment system, Raast, recorded 45 million registered IDs by June 2025 and processed 1.3bn transactions worth Rs29.6tr, more than doubling in both volume and value compared to the previous year. It said the number of QR-enabled merchants also crossed one million, twice as many as a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, adoption remains uneven across the economy. Only about 159,000 merchants currently use point-of-sale terminals, far fewer than in comparable emerging markets, while mobile banking penetration stands at roughly 15pc of total bank accounts, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh: Born In Hope, Trapped In Instability, Can Become Strategic Liability</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/bangladesh-born-hope-trapped-instability-can-become-strategic-liability</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Has India faltered in “handling” these two neighbours? In theory, perhaps. As the dominant regional power, expectations are inevitably high. In practice, however, India’s very dominance generates suspicion in both Pakistan and Bangladesh, sharply limiting its influence. Meanwhile, the United States, with its strategic weight, and China with its economic clout, have exercised far greater leverage over Pakistan for decades. A similar dynamic applies to Bangladesh. &lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>PFUJ condemns violence, arson, vandalism targeting media houses in Bangladesh during recent protests</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963364/pfuj-condemns-violence-arson-vandalism-targeting-media-houses-in-bangladesh-during-recent-protests</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) has condemned the recent surge of violence, vandalism, and arson targeting media houses in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A joint statement issued by PFUJ President Afzal Butt, and Secretary General Arshad Ansari on Friday said, “Silencing the press through physical intimidation is a direct violation of the constitutional right to freedom of expression and the rule of law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The statement comes days after Bangladesh saw violent protests following the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in last year’s student-led uprising that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;toppled&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; longtime Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961387&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;shot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the head by masked assailants in Dhaka on December 16 while launching his campaign for an election due in February. He &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;died &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Singapore on December 18.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following his death, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962210&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;violent protests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; broke out and several buildings, including those housing leading newspapers &lt;em&gt;Prothom Alo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;, were set on fire and vandalised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protesters accused the newspapers of enabling Hadi’s killing, calling them “Delhi’s lapdog” and “Sheikh Hasina’s enabler,” claims the newspapers denied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PFUJ statement denounced these “targeted attacks”,  as well as the “deplorable physical assault“ on Nurul Kabir, the veteran editor of &lt;em&gt;New Age&lt;/em&gt; newspaper and president of  Editors’ Council of Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PFUJ also expressed deep concern over reports that more than 100 journalists in Bangladesh remain detained without trial, demanding their immediate and unconditional release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the statement highlighted a “disturbing regional trend”, pointing to similar violence in Nepal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just months ago, mob attacks targeted the &lt;em&gt;Kantipur Group&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Annapurna Post&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Image TV&lt;/em&gt;,” the statement said, adding that the PFUJ leadership also paid tribute to photojournalist Suresh Rajak of &lt;em&gt;Avenews TV&lt;/em&gt;, who tragically died in an arson attack on March 28, 2025, in Kathmandu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PFUJ noted with “regret that perpetrators of these crimes remain unaccountable”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It called upon the governments concerned to conduct fair, impartial, and speedy investigations into all incidents of arson and violence; identify and bring the perpetrators to justice to end the culture of impunity; and ensure the safety of journalists as they perform their professional duties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Violence and harassment aimed at silencing the media are unacceptable in any democratic society,” the statement concluded.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lay of the land</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963333/lay-of-the-land</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;AS we close 2025, it is time to take a hard and honest look at the lay of the land of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nearly 78 years after independence, Pakistan’s politics remains deeply unsettled. Of these years, approximately 33 were spent under four periods of direct military rule, with the remainder under various shades of indirect or hybrid regimes. It took 23 years for the country to hold its first general elections. To date, Pakistan has had 29 prime ministers — including caretakers and repeat tenures — yet not a single one has completed a full five-year constitutional term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Decline is not destiny. All these crises are man-made and reversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s first prime minister, Liaquat Ali Khan, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962166&quot;&gt;assassinated&lt;/a&gt; in 1951. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dawn.com/news/1160422&quot;&gt;executed&lt;/a&gt; in 1979. Benazir Bhutto was &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;http://beta.dawn.com/news/282033/benazir-is-dead&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;assassinated&lt;/a&gt; in 2007. Former PM Imran Khan has been incarcerated for nearly two years and sentenced to a cumulative 51 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Externally, Pakistan has fought four major wars with India — in 1947-48, 1965, 1971, and 1999 — and continues to experience border tensions, including earlier this year in May. The dismemberment of the country in 1971 remains a major national trauma. In 1998, Pakistan became one of the world’s nine nuclear-armed states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demographic pressures have compounded these challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1947, West Pakistan’s population was approximately 32.7 million; today Pakistan’s population is close to 250m. East Pakistan, with a population of around 40m in 1947, as Bangladesh is now roughly 177m people. Pakistan’s population growth has outpaced its ability to govern, grow, educate, employ, and provide basic services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key determinants of national development — political stability, governance, respect for the Constitution and rule of law, inclusive institutions, economic growth, security, corruption control, and quality of life — are all in visible decline.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Politically, Pakistan lurches from one crisis to another. The current conflict is among the most serious in recent history. Since the tragic events of May 9, 2023, political polarisation has only intensified. At the heart of this crisis lies the unresolved question of civil-military relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security challenges further darken the picture. Cross-border terrorism is on the rise, insurgency continues in Balochistan, and relations with neighbouring countries have deteriorated, including now Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Governance failures are equally stark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the 18th Constitutional Amendment, provinces were granted authority and resources to manage policing, infrastructure, water and sanitation, health, education, and local governments. Yet provincial governments have largely failed to deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local government elections are routinely delayed or avoided to prevent the devolution of power and resources. Instead, development funds are distributed through MNAs and MPAs, fostering patronage, inefficiency, and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite long tenures — PPP in Sindh since 2008, PTI in KP since 2013, and repeated PML-N governments in Punjab over decades — the quality of governance and service delivery remains dismal. In southern Punjab and other marginalised regions, conditions are particularly dire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Constitution itself has been weakened. Politically motivated amendments, notably the 26th and 27th, have eroded judicial independence. Fundamental rights guaranteed under Part II, Chapter One of the Constitution are routinely violated, as are the Principles of Policy outlined in Chapter Two. Laws such as PECA, 2016, are increasingly used to suppress dissent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The erosion of the rule of law is reflected in global rankings. The World Justice Project defines the rule of law as the foundation of justice, opportunity, and peace. In its 2024 index covering 143 countries, Pakistan scored 0.37, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://worldjusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/documents/Pakistan_1.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ranking 130th&lt;/a&gt; overall. Among South Asian countries, only Afghanistan ranks lower. Most alarming is Pakistan’s last-place ranking — 143 out of 143 — in the “order and security” category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Economically, the situation is grim. Pakistan’s average growth rate over the past three years stands at just 1.7 per cent — the lowest for any three consecutive years in the country’s history. Approximately 45pc of the population lives below or near the poverty line, while unofficial unemployment assessment is at 22pc. This means nearly every second Pakistani is poor or near-poor, every fourth citizen is unemployed, and youth unemployment is even higher. Inflation over the past three to four years has reduced purchasing power by an estimated 65pc.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taxation levels are among the highest in the world, with salaried classes bearing a disproportionate brunt. Corporations face effective tax rates of around 60pc, while electricity tariffs are higher than in most comparable countries. The cost of doing business has become prohibitively high, driving companies out of Pakistan and depressing investment to historic lows, despite official claims that the economy has ‘stabilised.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s Human Development Index ranking has steadily worsened over the past decade. In 2024, Pakistan ranked 168 out of 193 countries, with all South Asian states except Afghanistan performing better. Health and education systems are in crisis: 40pc of children are stunted, and an estimated 40pc of school-age children are out of school. Pakistan ranks among the worst globally for neonatal mortality, hepatitis C prevalence, and type-II diabetes, and remains one of only two countries where polio has not been eradicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Women — half the population — continue to face systemic discrimination, exclusion, and lack of voice. In the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report 2025, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1916743&quot;&gt;Pakistan ranked last&lt;/a&gt;: 148 out of 148 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the sobering reality as 2025 draws to a close. But decline is not destiny. All these crises are man-made and therefore reversible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;History offers perspective. In 1965, Pakistan’s GDP per capita was comparable to that of China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and South Korea. Today, all are far ahead. In the 1990s, Pakistan was South Asia’s richest country and ranked above both India and Bangladesh on the Human Development Index. Many of these countries faced deep political and economic crises, yet emerged through sustained reforms, institutional strengthening, and political consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Credible economists now agree that Pakistan’s current economic model is unsustainable. Yet recovery remains possible — if the country undertakes fundamental shifts in governance, economic policy, and institutional integrity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, everything hinges on politics. Without resolving the present political conflict and its underlying causes, no economic or social reform can sustainably succeed. Pakistan urgently needs a broad national consensus on a new direction. As the new year approaches, such consensus appears distressingly distant.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Tarique Rahman, acting chairman of the BNP, has returned to Bangladesh after 17 years in exile, ahead of the February 12 parliamentary elections. His arrival reshapes the political landscape following Sheikh Hasina&apos;s ouster and amid ongoing political violence. India is closely monitoring these developments due to regional implications.</description>

      <title>Dhaka-Delhi rupture</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963334/dhaka-delhi-rupture</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;TIES between Bangladesh and India are experiencing extreme turbulence, especially after the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961387&quot;&gt; murder&lt;/a&gt; of prominent Bangladeshi student leader Sharif Osman Hadi, with his supporters and sympathisers claiming he was killed at India’s behest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week a Hindutva mob &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808&quot;&gt;tried to storm&lt;/a&gt; the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi, while attacks on Bangladeshi diplomatic missions in other Indian cities have also been reported.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extremist groups in India such as the VHP are using the tragic lynching of a Bangladeshi Hindu man in Mymensingh as an excuse to target Dhaka’s missions in India. Bangladesh’s interim authorities had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962902&quot;&gt;summoned&lt;/a&gt; the Indian high commissioner in Dhaka to protest against attacks on their missions in India, while Dhaka’s representative in Delhi was similarly summoned in a tit-for-tat exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim foreign minister has said his country’s top diplomat in India had received death threats. The Indian state, meanwhile, has tried to downplay the events, particularly attempts by extremist mobs to target Bangladeshi missions.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s rule, Dhaka and Delhi were very much on the same page. However, anti-India feeling in Bangladesh has erupted after Ms Wajed’s government was toppled last year, with many seeing Delhi as supporting her authoritarian rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact that Sheikh Hasina fled to India after last year’s uprising has done little to dispel this impression. Moreover, reports that Osman Hadi’s suspected killer escaped to India have further added to the anger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the key reason behind the fraying of ties between both states is India’s patronising attitude towards its neighbours. Delhi should cooperate with Dhaka to trace Hadi’s killers, and should refrain from meddling in Bangladesh’s internal affairs and fanning communal fires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fact is that for there to be peace and amity in South Asia, the sovereignty of all states must be respected, and no state must act as if it is the regional hegemon, free to throw its weight around and bully others.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Pakistan emerges as main recipient of Chinese combat aircraft</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963311/pakistan-emerges-as-main-recipient-of-chinese-combat-aircraft</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: China continues to strengthen its position as a major global arms supplier, with Pakistan emerging as its most significant and trusted partner in the air combat domain, according to a Pentagon report sent to the US Congress this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report states that as of December 2024, China remained the world’s fourth-largest arms exporter, relying primarily on state-owned defence companies such as the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) and North Industries Corporation (Norinco).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It notes that China’s arms exports are closely linked to its broader foreign policy and development outreach, including initiatives associated with the Belt and Road framework, and are particularly attractive to developing countries due to affordability and flexible terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to this report, Pakistan figures prominently in China’s aviation exports. Beijing currently offers three fixed-wing combat aircraft for export: the fifth-generation FC-31 stealth fighter, the fourth-generation J-10C multirole combat aircraft, and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1956309&quot;&gt;JF-17&lt;/a&gt; Thunder, which is jointly developed and produced by China and Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Importantly, the report confirms that Pakistan is the only country to which China has exported the J-10C. As of May 2025, China had delivered 20 J-10C aircraft to the Pakistan Air Force under two orders placed since 2020, with total orders amounting to 36 aircraft. While several other countries — including Egypt, Uzbekistan, Indonesia, Iran and Bangladesh — have expressed interest, no J-10C exports beyond Pakistan have taken place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pentagon report says Beijing has strengthened its position as major arms supplier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The report also highlights the JF-17 programme as a successful example of defence collaboration between two developing countries. Jointly produced by Pakistan and China, the aircraft is already in service with multiple air forces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of 2024, Azerbaijan, Myanmar and Nigeria were operating the JF-17, while Iraq was reported to be in discussions. For Pakistan, the aircraft remains a central component of its air force as well as an important defence export.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to manned aircraft, the Pentagon report notes that China has supplied Pakistan with advanced, strike-capable unma­nned aerial vehicles, including the Caihong and Wing Loong series. These systems have also been exported to several other countries, reflecting China’s growing role in the global UAV market.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond aviation, the report says China exports a wide range of military equipment across land, air defence and naval domains. Pakistan is identified as a long-standing recipient of Chinese naval platforms, including four frigates delivered in 2017 and 2018. The report adds that China is expected to expand its naval exports in the coming years, with Pakistan remaining among its core partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pentagon assessment attributes China’s growing appeal in the global arms market to competitive pricing, flexible financing and the absence of restrictive political conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, the defence relationship with China is not limited to arms purchases but reflects a mature partnership encompassing joint development, production and long-term strategic cooperation, the report notes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladesh Students League president Saddam Hussain accused the interim government and its leader Muhammad Yunus of encouraging anti-India rhetoric to appease extremist groups and cover up governance failures. He also criticised the return of BNP acting chairman Tarique Rahman, calling it a backdoor deal that could deepen political polarisation and undermine democracy. The developments come amid continued mob killings, political unrest and heightened concerns over minority safety and law and order ahead of the February 17 general elections.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh leader considered top PM candidate returns after nearly 17 years in exile ahead of polls</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162/bangladesh-leader-considered-top-pm-candidate-returns-after-nearly-17-years-in-exile-ahead-of-polls</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh Nationalist Party acting chairman Tarique Rahman returned to Dhaka on Thursday after nearly 17 years in exile, a homecoming the party hopes will energise supporters with Rahman poised to be the top contender for prime minister in the February 12 elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of supporters lined the route from the capital’s airport to the reception venue, waving party flags and carrying placards, banners, and flowers, while chanting slogans welcoming Rahman, as senior BNP leaders received him at the Dhaka airport under tight security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, 60, the son of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958157&quot;&gt;ailing&lt;/a&gt; former prime minister Khaleda Zia, has lived in London since 2008 and led the BNP as acting chairman since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dressed in a light grey, finely checkered blazer over a crisp white shirt, Rahman exited the airport, removed his shoes to step barefoot onto Bangladeshi soil, and picked up a handful of earth in a symbolic gesture marking his return to the South Asian nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was seen standing beside the driver’s seat in a bus taking him to the reception venue, smiling and waving as crowds surged to catch a glimpse of their returning leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He had been unable to return while facing multiple criminal cases at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman was convicted in absentia on charges that included money laundering and in a case linked to an alleged plot to assassinate former prime minister Sheikh Hasina but the rulings were overturned after Hasina was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ousted &lt;/a&gt;last year in a student-led uprising, clearing the legal barriers to his return.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His homecoming also carries personal urgency, with Khaleda Zia seriously ill for months. Party officials said Rahman would travel from the airport to a reception venue before visiting his mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The political landscape has shifted sharply since Hasinas removal from power, ending decades in which she and Khaleda Zia largely alternated in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A December survey by the US based International Republican Institute suggested the BNP is on course to win the largest number of parliamentary seats, with the Jamaat-e-Islami party also in the race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina’s Awami League party, which has been barred from the election, has threatened unrest that some fear could disrupt the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh is heading into the polls under an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While authorities have pledged a free and peaceful election, recent attacks on media outlets and sporadic violence have raised concerns, making Rahman‘s return a defining moment for the BNP and the country’s fragile political transition.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Khaleda Zia’s heir set to end exile, return to Bangladesh after 17 years</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1963085/khaleda-zias-heir-set-to-end-exile-return-to-bangladesh-after-17-years</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: The heir to Bangladesh’s longtime ruling family and a leader of its most powerful political party, Tarique Rahman is set to return home after 17 years in exile and ahead of key elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, 60, an aspiring prime minister who has lived in London since he fled Bangladesh in 2008 over what he called a politically motivated persecution, is due to arrive in Dhaka on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acting chairman of the Bang­la­desh Nationalist Party (BNP), he is expected to take the reins from his &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1958157&quot;&gt;ailing mother&lt;/a&gt;, 80-year-old former prime minister Khaleda Zia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite years of ill health and imprisonment, Zia vowed in November to campaign in the February 12, 2026 elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But she was hospitalised soon after that pledge, and she has been in intensive care ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elections will be the first since a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;mass uprising&lt;/a&gt; last year &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;ended &lt;/a&gt;the 15-year hardline rule of Sheikh Hasina, who was at odds with the BNP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since Hasina’s fall from power, Rahman has been acquitted of the most serious charge against him: a life sentence handed down in absentia for a 2004 grenade attack on a Hasina rally. He had denied the charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP secretary general Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir has promised Rahman will “arrive among us on the soil of Dhaka” on Dec 25, which he said will be a “fantastic day”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarique Rahman, often pictured beside his mother on BNP banners, has long been groomed for leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, he met in London with Muhammad Yunus, the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner leading the interim government until the February elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Violent politics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, known in Bangladesh as Tarique Zia, carries a political name that has defined his life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Born in 1967 when the country was still East Pakistan, he was briefly detained as a child during the 1971 independence war. The BNP hails him as “one of the youngest prisoners of war”. His father, Ziaur Rahman, was an army commander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ziaur Rahman gained influence months after a 1975 coup in which Sheikh Hasina’s father, founding leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was murdered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That fuelled lifelong tensions bet­ween the Zia and Hasina families, dubbed the “Battle of the Begums”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ziaur Rahman was assassinated when his son was 15. The younger Rahman grew up in his mother’s political orbit, as Zia went on to become the country’s first female prime minister, alternating her terms in power with Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman briefly studied international relations at Dhaka University before entering politics at 23, joining the BNP in its fight against military ruler Hussain Muhammad Ershad, according to his party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allegations of nepotism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Rahman’s career has been dogged by allegations of nepotism and mismanagement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 2006 US embassy cable des­cri­bed him as the BNP’s “heir apparent” who “inspires few but unnerves many”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other cables labelled him a “symbol of kleptocratic government and violent politics” and accused him of being “phenomenally corrupt”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman was arrested on corruption charges in 2007 and claimed he was tortured in custody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports suggested his release was conditional on leaving politics. Freed later that year, he flew to London in 2008 for medical treatment and never returned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Hasina swept to power in 2008, her government jailed tens of thousands of BNP members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, Rahman was again sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment for allegedly orchestrating the 2004 attack on Hasina’s rally.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As crowds attack newspaper offices and violence has killed 184 people, the optimism around Sheikh Hasina’s overthrow has dimmed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sounds of a mob were already audible when Zyma Islam hit send on her article for Friday’s edition of Bangladesh’s Daily Star newspaper. She quickly headed out, hoping to avoid the crowd that had already burned down the offices of Prothom Alo, another of Bangladesh’s most prestigious newspapers. But when she reached the door, they were already there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rioters were a&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/dec/19/sharif-osman-hadi-dead-bangladesh-violence-protests&quot;&gt;ngered by the assassination of Sharif Osman Hadi&lt;/a&gt;, a prominent leader from the pro-democracy movement that unseated the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/nov/17/ousted-bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-found-guilty-of-crimes-against-humanity&quot;&gt;former prime minister Sheikh Hasina&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What is unfolding in Bangladesh bears unsettling resemblance to trajectories seen in Pakistan and Afghanistan, where false blasphemy accusations have long been used to terrorize minorities and silence dissent.

      <title>Govt sets two-month timeline for spectrum auction</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1962943/govt-sets-two-month-timeline-for-spectrum-auction</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• IT minister says process to improve 3G and 4G services, pave way for 5G launch&lt;br /&gt;• Claims 245m Pakistanis ‘making do’ with 274MHz, compared to 600MHz available in Bangladesh&lt;br /&gt;• ECC approves over $7m bailout package for PIA-IL to discharge $4m tax liability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: The government on Tuesday approved the process for the auction of 600 megahertz (MHz) spectrum within two months, followed by the rollout of 5G internet in five to six months, on the recommendation of a US-based consultancy firm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision was made at a meeting of the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet, which also approved a Rs20bn (more than $7m) bailout package for Pakistan International Airlines Investment Limited (PIA-IL) to discharge $4m tax liability against Roosevelt Hotel, New York, and other domestic loan liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a no-questions-asked recorded statement, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and Information Technology Minister Shaza Fatima Khwaja said the new spectrum auction, to be completed by early February, would be ten times larger than the 60MHz auctioned over all past auctions put together because internet congestion was a major constraint to the nation’s digitisation transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The finance minister said recommendations for the spectrum auction were prepared by National Economic Research Associates (NERA), based on experiences in recent spectrum auctions in other countries, including process, pricing mechanism, auction and implementation strategies. He said the success of digitisation, digital inclusion and financial inclusion was linked to faster, cheaper and better processes, and unsold spectrum was directly translating into economic losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IT Minister Shaza Fatima said that under the ECC decision, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) would complete all spectrum auctions by the end of January or early February because Pakistan was behind regional competitors due to the unavailability of spectrum capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said Pakistan’s 245m population had access to only 274MHz spectrum compared to 600MHz available to the 175m people of Bangladesh. That was the major reason for internet traffic congestion in Pakistan, she said, adding, “This means we are using two lanes for traffic which requires eight lanes…your internet does not work and you face challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She said the upcoming auction would not only improve 3G and 4G services but also enable the launch of 5G, and more international operators would enter the country. The operators would be obligated, under the terms of the auction, to roll out all spectrums within four to six months, so that service improvements become visible to the people in five to six months and to be followed by 5G rollout in six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms Khwaja said the internet was a basic ingredient to the government’s digitisation efforts, for which the Digital Nation Pakistan Act 2025 had already been put in place. According to Connect 2030, to be inaugurated by the prime minister soon, the government would ensure that over the next five years, the minimum connectivity available to users should be 100 Mbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the decision, Pakistan would now be offering 606MHz of new spectrum across six major bands, including 700MHz, 1800MHz, 2100MHz, 2300MHz and new bands 2600MHz and 3500MHz. The 2600 and 3500MHz band are considered conducive to 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PIA bailout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECC also approved about Rs20bn (about $7m) bailout to PIA-IL against $17.5m demanded by the Defence Division to meet tax liabilities of Roosevelt Hotel due on January 1, 2026.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October, the Ministry of Defence &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1946209&quot;&gt;sought&lt;/a&gt; around $17.5 million to meet urgent liabilities at the Manhattan property, which could require up to $20m to restart operations pending a joint-venture arrangement through the Privatisation Commission. The hotel’s $200m lease with New York City, under which it housed migrants, was terminated earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ECC had directed PIA-IL and the ministry to hold separate deliberations with the Ministry of Finance to rationalise their demand, which appeared exaggerated to the committee members. These meetings led to the identification of $4m tax payable by the end of the current month to avoid any adverse action in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the company was also in default in debt servicing to the National Bank of Pakistan, for which another $3.5m equivalent of rupee cover was approved for settlements and rollovers.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Trade deficit with nine states swells to $6.22bn</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1962912/trade-deficit-with-nine-states-swells-to-622bn</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s trade gap with nine neighbouring countries widened by 39.33 per cent to $6.221 billion in the first five months 2025-26 compared to $4.465bn in the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The soaring deficit is mainly the outcome of a decline in Pakistan’s overall exports to regional countries, mainly led by a drop in exports to China, followed by Afghanistan. Pakistan has suspended all kinds of trade, including exports to Afghanistan, since Oct 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A marginal increase was also recorded in exports to India, but in value its volume is very negligible. The shipments to Bangladesh and Sri Lanka registered negative growth during the period under review, according to the latest &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.sbp.org.pk/publications/export/2025/Jun/5.pdf&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In FY25, Pakistan’s trade deficit with nine neighbouring countries &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1943564&quot;&gt;expanded&lt;/a&gt; by 29.42pc to $12.297bn compared to $9.502bn in the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The value of Pakistan’s exports to nine countries — Afghanistan, China, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Nepal, Bhutan and the Maldives — dipped 17.05pc to $1.635 billion in July-November FY26 from $1.971bn over the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In FY25, Pakistan’s exports to nine countries rose 1.49pc to $4.401bn from $4.336bn the preceding year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to this, imports surged 22.06pc to $7.856bn in 5MFY26 from $6.436bn in 5MFY25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further analysis showed that imports from China grew by 22.90pc to $7.713bn in 5MFY26 from $6.275bn in the same period last year. In FY25, imports from China stood at $16.312bn, up by 20.79pc from $13.504bn in the preceding year. The bulk of imports in the region are sourced from China, followed partially by India and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s exports to China fell by 6.84pc to $982.984m in 5MFY26 from $1.055bn over the same months in the preceding fiscal year. In FY25, Pakistan’s exports to China dipped 8.6pc to $2.476bn from $2.709bn in the preceding fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imports from India dipped by 19.11pc to $76.668m in 5MFY26 from $94.784m over the last year. In FY25, import from India increased to $220.58m from $206.89m over the last year. Meanwhile, exports to India registered an uptick to $2.926m in 5MFY26 from $0.375m over the corresponding period last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to Afghanistan dipped 94.72pc to $210.556m in 5MFY26 from $408.585m last year. Imports stood at $8.527m in 5MFY26 against $8.527m in FY25, a drop of 34.46pc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s exports to Bangladesh declined by 7.36pc to $292.119m in 5MFY26 from $315.335m over the last year. In FY25, exports to Bangladesh increased by 19.08pc to $787.35m from $661.19m. Imports grew 30.19pc to $21.73m in 3MFY26 from $16.69m over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exports to Sri Lanka dipped by 23.57pc to $143.024m in 5MFY26 from $187.132m over the last year. Imports, however, rose 10.36pc to $28.411m from $25.742m in 5MFY25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No data is available as most trade with Iran is conducted via informal channels. However, Pakistan has opted for barter trade amid the thriving smuggling of Iranian petroleum products and LPG via the porous border of Balochistan. No trade was observed between Pakistan and Bhutan during the 5MFY26 from last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very negligible trade was recorded between Pakistan, the Maldives and Nepal during the months under review.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladeshi journalists face grave threats, including arson attacks on media offices and personal surveillance, ahead of the 2026 elections. Despite promises of safety, reporters feel unprotected, with no arrests made following the torching of Prothom Alo and The Daily Star. This escalating crisis signals a dangerous erosion of press freedom.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh summons Indian envoy over protests targeting its diplomatic facilities, vandalism at visa centre</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1962808/bangladesh-summons-indian-envoy-over-protests-targeting-its-diplomatic-facilities-vandalism-at-visa-centre</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh on Tuesday summoned India’s high commissioner in Dhaka to protest what it described as violent incidents targeting its diplomatic facilities in India, including vandalism at visa centres and protests outside its mission in New Delhi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it summoned Indian High Commissioner Pranay Verma to convey Dhaka’s grave concern over what it called “regrettable incidents” outside the Bangladesh High Commission and the ambassador’s residence in New Delhi on December 20, as well as vandalism at the Bangladesh Visa Centre in Siliguri on December 22 by “extremist elements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ministry condemned what it described as premeditated acts of violence and intimidation against diplomatic establishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said such acts not only “endanger the safety of diplomatic personnel but also undermine the principles of mutual respect and values of peace and tolerance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling for a proper investigation, the ministry said: “Bangladesh expects the Government of India to immediately take appropriate steps in accordance with its international and diplomatic obligations to safeguard the dignity and security of diplomatic personnel and establishments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Bangladeshi media, around 20 to 25 protesters had gathered in front of the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi on Saturday evening. According to mission officials, the protesters raised anti-Bangladesh slogans and issued threats against the Bangladesh high commissioner, &lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://en.prothomalo.com/international/india/tz5n8ep62o&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;Prothom Alo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that the New Delhi demonstration consisted of “20-25 youths” who were dispersed by police after a few minutes, adding that India was “committed to ensure the safety of foreign missions”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal also said that India had taken note of “misleading propaganda in sections of the Bangladesh media on the incident”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the Bangldesh foreign ministry issued a statement, saying that the “unjustifiable incident at the Bangladesh High Commission residence in New Delhi on December 20 is highly regrettable and cannot be accepted as ‘misleading propaganda’”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tensions with India come as Bangladesh struggles to deal with domestic unrest over the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928&quot;&gt;death&lt;/a&gt; of youth leader Sharif Osman Hadi, who was shot in the head while launching his campaign for February’s parliamentary election last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His killing sparked widespread &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962210&quot;&gt;protests &lt;/a&gt;that spiralled into arson and vandalism &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962028&quot;&gt;targeting &lt;/a&gt;major media outlets and cultural institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi newspaper&lt;a class=&quot;link--external&quot; href=&quot;https://www.thedailystar.net/news/bangladesh/news/protests-held-sylhet-over-hadis-death-prothom-alo-office-attacked-4061966&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;u&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; previously reported that around 100 protesters had gathered in the Chowhatta area and demanded that those responsible for Hadi‘s killing be brought to justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Addressing the gathering, protesters alleged that the killing had been carried out ‘at the behest of India’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh has also &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962753/internal-turmoil-diplomatic-crisis-grip-bangladesh&quot;&gt;halted all consular and visa services&lt;/a&gt; at its High Commission in New Delhi while the Indian Visa Application Centre in the Bangladeshi city of Chattogram has suspended its operations, citing security concerns at India’s mission there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another development connected to the tensions between the two countries, hundreds of people protested near Bangladesh’s High Commission in New Delhi today against the lynching of a Hindu man over allegations of blasphemy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Factory worker Dipu Chandra Das, 27, was beaten and set on fire in Bangladesh’s Mymensingh district last week by a crowd that accused him of making derogatory remarks against Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). At least 10 people have been arrested in connection with his death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuesday’s demonstration, called by Hindu groups, involved people clashing with police personnel as they tried to push through barricades set up near the High Commission, television footage showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They also chanted slogans and burnt pictures of Bangladesh Chief Adviser Professor Muhammad Yunus, with some holding posters demanding “boycott Bangladesh”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We needed to raise the voice of Hindus in Bangladesh in Delhi, and we have done that … as long as even one Hindu is being harmed there, we will be awake and will not stop,” a protester told broadcaster India Today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demonstrations were also held in other parts of the country, as well as in India-occupied Kashmir.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Internal turmoil, diplomatic crisis grip Bangladesh</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1962753/internal-turmoil-diplomatic-crisis-grip-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• Dhaka suspends consular, visa services in New Delhi; Indian centre in Chattogram reciprocates&lt;br /&gt;• Inqilab Moncho threatens to topple interim govt, demands resignations&lt;br /&gt;• 17 held as govt promises speedy trial&lt;br /&gt;• Journalists protest amid death threats, attacks on media&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After student leader Osman Hadi’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961928&quot;&gt;assassination&lt;/a&gt;, crises on both the external and internal fronts have deepened in Bangladesh, which has halted all consular and visa services at its High Commission in New Delhi, while the nation grapples with unrest stemming from arrests, journalists’ protests, and threats of a government overthrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Due to unavoidable circumstances, all consular and visa services from the Bangladesh High Commission in New Delhi are temporarily suspended until further notice,” a notice posted by the Bangladesh mission said. “Any inconvenience caused is sincerely regretted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move came two days after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962623&quot;&gt;demonstration&lt;/a&gt; by 20 to 25 people outside the diplomatic mission in New Delhi. Foreign Adviser Touhid Hossain told reporters on Sunday that Bangladesh High Commissioner Riaz Hamidullah received death threats from the protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Indian Ministry of External Affairs Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said on Sunday there was no attempt to breach the mission’s security and that police dispersed the small group within minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The protesters were demonstrating against the killing of a garment worker, Dipu Chandra Das, in Bangladesh and demanding protection for minorities, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tensions have been reciprocal. On Sunday, the Indian Visa Application Centre in the Bangladeshi city of Chattogram suspended its operations, citing security concerns at India’s mission there. High commissioners for both countries have been summoned by their respective host governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The developments indicated increasing friction between the two nations, as &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; noted that these developments point to diplomatic tensions escalating towards a crisis and advised that both Delhi and Dhaka should work towards reducing the tensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threats to interim govt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The turmoil stems from the killing of Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in a pro-democracy uprising last year that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ousted&lt;/a&gt; former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who has since taken refuge in India. Masked gunmen &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961387&quot;&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; Hadi earlier this month, and he died from his injuries on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His death ignited furious &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962210&quot;&gt;protests&lt;/a&gt;, with mobs setting fire to several buildings, including the offices of &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Prothom Alo&lt;/em&gt;, two of the country’s leading newspapers, which some protesters perceive as favourable to India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, the student group Inqilab Moncho on Monday threatened a movement to remove the interim government, holding it responsible for Hadi’s death. The group demanded the immediate resignations of the home adviser, his special assistant and the law adviser for failing to provide security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Justice must be ensured before the election; no election will take place before that,” Abdullah Al Jaber, member secretary of the group, said at a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He warned that activists would not leave the streets until Hadi’s killers are brought to justice and would topple the government if their demands were not met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group also called for an international investigation by agencies like the FBI or Scotland Yard. Law Adviser Asif Nazrul responded by announcing the murder case would be tried at a speedy trial tribunal, with a verdict expected within 90 days of the police report being filed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Journalists’ protest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, journalists in Dhaka held a human chain protest on Monday to condemn the arson attacks and threats against the press. Media leaders said threats have escalated from debates over free expression to concerns for their very survival.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“On social media, we have seen messages saying journalists of &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Prothom Alo&lt;/em&gt; should be hunted down and killed in their homes,” said Mahfuz Anam, editor and publisher of &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;. “This is no longer about opinions. These are murder threats.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He made the remarks while delivering a solidarity speech at a joint protest titled “Bangladesh Under the Attack of Mob Viole­nce”, organised by the Editors’ Council and the Newspaper Owners’ Association of Bangladesh (NOAB) at a hotel in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nahid Islam, convener of the National Citizen Party (NCP), today said they believe the attacks involved a section of the government and had political backing. “The whole incident was planned,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AK Azad said about 28 journalists were trapped inside &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt;’s office during the firebombing and claimed that pleas for help were ignored until after the attack was over. He said security forces were present but did not intervene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also announced plans to hold a conference in Dhaka for journalists from across the country in mid-January, vowing to continue protests until those responsible for recent arson attacks on &lt;em&gt;The Daily Star&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Prothom Alo&lt;/em&gt; are brought to justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nurul Kabir, editor of the &lt;em&gt;New Age&lt;/em&gt; daily, said the attackers intended to kill. “They set newspaper offices on fire and blocked the fire service from entering,” he said. “This clearly shows they wanted to burn people alive simply because they disagreed with them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrests and violence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Police said they have arrested 17 people in connection with the newspaper attacks. Dhaka Metropolitan Police Additional Commissioner SN Nazrul Islam said officers exercised restraint to avoid casualties among the 4,000 to 5,000 protesters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The fact that no human life was lost in such a major incident is what we see as our achievement,” he said, adding that social media misinformation had inflamed the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Political figures from across the spectrum have voiced concern over the escalating violence as the country prepares for general elections in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, democracy itself has been attacked,” said Mirza Fakh­rul Islam Alamgir, secretary-general of the opposition Bangla­desh Nationalist Party. “This is the time for all democratic people to unite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The broader unrest was highlighted by a separate incident where Border Guard Bangladesh intensified surveillance along the Benapole border after an NCP leader, Md Motaleb Shikdar, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1962632&quot;&gt;shot&lt;/a&gt; and injured in Khulna.&lt;/p&gt;
