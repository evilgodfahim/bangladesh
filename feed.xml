      <title>Bangladesh’s Yunus announces resignation, end of interim govt</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973711/bangladeshs-yunus-announces-resignation-end-of-interim-govt</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s interim leader Muhammad Yunus stepped down on Monday in a farewell broadcast to the nation, before handing over the reins to an elected government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Today, the interim government is stepping down,” the 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner said. “But let the practice of democracy, freedom of speech, and fundamental rights that has begun not be halted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus returned from self-imposed exile in August 2024, days after the iron-fisted government of Sheikh Hasina was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;overthrown&lt;/a&gt; by a student-led uprising, and she &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245/bangladesh-pm-sheikh-hasina-has-resigned-interim-govt-to-run-country-army-chief#:~:text=Hasina%20flees%20to%20India&quot;&gt;fled &lt;/a&gt;by helicopter to India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“That was the day of great liberation,” he said. “What a day of joy it was! Bangladeshis across the world shed tears of happiness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has led Bangladesh as its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;chief adviser&lt;/a&gt; since, and now hands over power after congratulating the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its leader Tarique Rahman on a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890&quot;&gt;landslide victory&lt;/a&gt;” in elections last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The people, voters, political parties, and stakeholder institutions linked to the election have set a commendable example,” Yunus said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This election has set a benchmark for future elections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, 60, chief of the BNP and scion of one of the country’s most powerful political dynasties, will lead the South Asian nation of 170 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#rebuilt-institutions&quot; id=&quot;rebuilt-institutions&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Rebuilt institutions’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladeshi voters endorsed sweeping democratic reforms in a national referendum, a key pillar of Yunus’s post-uprising transition agenda, on the same day as the elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lengthy &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1949661&quot;&gt;document&lt;/a&gt;, known as the “July Charter” after the month when the uprising that toppled Hasina began, proposes term limits for prime ministers, the creation of an upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We did not start from zero — we started from a deficit,” he said. “Sweeping away the ruins, we rebuilt institutions and set the course for reforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The referendum noted that approval would make the charter “binding on the parties that win” the election, obliging them to endorse it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, several parties raised questions before the vote, and the reforms will still require ratification by the new parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman conceded on Saturday, saying his party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly elected lawmakers are expected to be sworn in on Tuesday, after which Tarique Rahman is set to become Bangladesh’s next prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police records show that political clashes during the campaign period killed five people and injured more than 600.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has responded to the results with relative calm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The far-right Restore Britain party was launched on Friday night in Great Yarmouth by former Reform MP Rupert Lowe and has been endorsed by Elon Musk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowe, a millionaire businessman and farmer who used to be chairman of Southampton FC, released an &quot;immigration policy&quot;, which he called &quot;deportation poetry&quot;, over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He pledged to close off visa routes for &quot;Albania, Pakistan, Somalia, Eritrea, Afghanistan and plenty more&quot;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;We will discriminate,&quot; Lowe proclaimed. &quot;We will look at the facts, and then discriminate.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Lowe&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023386586864386140?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the party would &quot;abolish the entire asylum systems&quot;, adding: &quot;No more asylum seekers.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party has &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RestoreBritain_/status/2023306233219068141?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it has more than 50,000 members already. Over the weekend, Lowe &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2022580807336911236?s=20&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that a Restore Britain government would ban non-stun halal and kosher slaughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;In Britain, we treat our animals with care - we do not brutally butcher them alive,&quot; he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, the MP was widely criticised after&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/uk/rupert-lowe-admits-putting-down-labrador-with-shotgun-b1234246.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;revealing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;he asked his gamekeeper to shoot his 17-year-old dog in the back of the head at his estate in Gloucestershire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the dog, Cromwell, could no longer use his back legs and described his decision as &quot;humane&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;&apos;Cousin marriages will be outlawed&apos;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lowe was suspended from Reform in March last year after&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2025/may/21/rupert-lowe-antisemitic-remark-parliament-meeting-reform&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;calling&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;it a &quot;protest party led by the Messiah&quot; and criticising Farage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the MP &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023304275217072259?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; on X: &quot;Cousin marriages will be outlawed, so don’t even try and bring your wifecousin in from Pakistan. Not happening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;Restore Britain will not be putting forward any Bangladeshi candidates, I promise you that&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;But if a British man wants to bring his American wife to Britain in order to build a life together, then we will encourage and enable that,&quot; he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MP &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023304275217072259?s=20&quot;&gt;promised&lt;/a&gt; a selective easing of &quot;fees and rules around spouse visas&quot; that would not apply to people from &quot;Pakistan, Albania, Bangladesh, Somalia, Afghanistan and many, many more&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He also &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023083380716327408?s=20&quot;&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; for a &quot;total ban on all foreigners voting, or standing in elections&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Restore Britain will not be putting forward any Bangladeshi candidates, I promise you that,&quot; he added.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the party&apos;s campaigns director and spokesman, Charlie Downes, became embroiled in a social media argument with Matt Goodwin, Reform&apos;s parliamentary candidate in the upcoming Gorton and Denton by-election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Downes &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/GoodwinMJ/status/2023340610548105694?s=20&quot;&gt;accused&lt;/a&gt; Reform of deploying &quot;Regime attack lines when their electoral prospects are threatened by an authentically anti-establishment offering,&quot; after Goodwin criticised a far-right X account for mocking Sikh supporters of Reform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to Downes, Goodwin &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/GoodwinMJ/status/2023340610548105694?s=20&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;You and many Restore people around you appear to be advocating blatant racism, calling to not just deport illegal migrants and foreign criminals (which is Reform policy) but throw out settled Brits who work hard, pay taxes, and play by the rules.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;div class=&quot;mee-readmore-description&quot;&gt;Reform candidate Matt Goodwin: From &apos;liberal left&apos; to Islamophobia sceptic&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a class=&quot;mee-readmore-link&quot; href=&quot;https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/reform-candidate-matt-goodwins-most-shocking-statements-muslims-and-race&quot;&gt;Read More »&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He added: &quot;Your ecosystem is riddled with white supremacists, antisemites, racists and conspiracy theorists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goodwin himself has a long record of making controversial comments about ethnicity and Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most contentiously, he has repeatedly&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/jan/27/matthew-goodwin-gorton-and-denton-reform-uk-minorities&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;insisted&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that British-born people with immigrant parents are not necessarily British.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advance UK, led by former Reform deputy leader Ben Habib and backed by far-right activist Tommy Robinson, has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2026/feb/15/rupert-lowe-great-yarmouth-first-party-far-right-reform-uk&quot;&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it will consider a merger with Lowe&apos;s Restore Britain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Restore Britain has said it will act as an umbrella political party that partners with locally based political parties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The party could cause a headache for Farage and his Reform party by splitting the anti-immigration vote in many constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;What is necessary for Britain will be incredibly painful,&quot; Lowe &lt;a href=&quot;https://x.com/RupertLowe10/status/2023155273704103976?s=20&quot;&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; on Sunday. &quot;This is going to be the fight of our lives.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>In meeting with Naqvi, Sri Lankan president appreciates Pakistan’s support during ‘difficult times’</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973707/in-meeting-with-naqvi-sri-lankan-president-appreciates-pakistans-support-during-difficult-times</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD: In a meeting with a delegation from Pakistan on Monday, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake appreciated Islamabad’s support during “difficult times”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sri Lankan president shared photos of the meeting held in Colombo on social media platform X, saying that he had met Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development Chaudhry Salik Hussain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We reaffirmed our enduring friendship [and] appreciated Pakistan’s support to Sri Lanka during difficult times,” the post by Dissanayake said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
        &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anuradisanayake/status/2023376056657559557&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further stated that the “Pakistan delegation conveyed special thanks from Pakistan’s president and prime minister for Sri Lanka’s timely intervention when Pakistan’s participation in the T20 [World Cup] was uncertain”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days ahead of the ongoing T20 global showpiece, the Pakistan government had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;decided&lt;/a&gt; that the country’s cricket team would not play against India in the group-stage match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decision had come after Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;replaced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the tournament, following their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965053&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;refusal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to tour India over safety concerns in the wake of soured political relations between the Asian neighbours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Sri Lanka’s cricket board &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971254&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;asked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Pakistan to reconsider the decision to boycott the match; Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) told the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) that a boycott would result in a financial hit and also hurt the island’s tourism industry, which is still recovering from the 2022 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1699179&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;economic meltdown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/in-phone-call-with-pm-sri-lanka-president-urges-pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-clash-against-india&quot;&gt;withdrew its decision&lt;/a&gt; to boycott the India match on February 9, saying: “The government of Pakistan has reviewed the formal requests extended to the PCB by the Bangladesh Cricket Board, as well as the supporting communications from Sri Lanka, the United Arab Emirates, and other member nations. These correspondences sought Pakistan’s leadership in securing a viable solution to recent challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the withdrawal, PM Shehbaz had also received a phone call from Dissanayake. The Sri Lankan president urged Pakistan to play the match against India, in response to which PM Shehbaz said he would inform him about a “final decision” regarding the match after consultations, state-run &lt;em&gt;PTV News&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after Pakistan announced its decision to play the match, Dissanayake thanked the premier for “ensuring the game we all love goes on”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Delighted that the eagerly awaited India and Pakistan match at the ongoing T20 Cricket World Cup in Colombo will proceed as planned,” he said in a post on X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#joint-strategy-against-cybercrime-financial-fraud-mafia&quot; id=&quot;joint-strategy-against-cybercrime-financial-fraud-mafia&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Joint strategy against cybercrime, financial fraud mafia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Pakistan and Sri Lanka agreed to develop a joint strategy against cybercrimes and financial fraud mafias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The understanding was reached during a meeting of Naqvi with his Sri Lankan counterpart, Minister of Public Security Ananda Wijepala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a handout released by the Interior Ministry’s media wing, the meeting focused on strengthening bilateral cooperation and matters of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Ministers also discussed ways to enhance cooperation in internal security and joint efforts in counterterrorism and anti-narcotics operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‎It was agreed to strengthen institutional collaboration between the interior ministries of Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The two sides also decided to improve coordination to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Matters relating to joint training programs for police and paramilitary forces were also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi offered training opportunities for Sri Lankan police officers at the National Police Academy of Pakistan. He stated that officer exchange programs would enhance the professional capacity of forces in both countries and open new avenues of cooperation between the two ministries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also emphasised the need to expand collaboration to effectively combat cybercrime and financial crimes. Naqvi also invited the Sri Lankan minister to visit Pakistan and expressed gratitude for the warm hospitality extended to him during his visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sri Lankan minister welcomed Naqvi, stating that it was a matter of great pleasure for Sri Lanka and affirmed their commitment to promoting cooperation with Pakistan in areas of mutual interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#security-cooperation&quot; id=&quot;security-cooperation&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Security cooperation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi also met with Sri Lanka’s Secretary of Defence Air Vice Marshal (Retd.) Sampatha Thuyacontha.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The meeting included discussions on Pakistan–Sri Lanka security cooperation and defence matters. Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to further enhance bilateral security cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‎The defence secretary acknowledged that Sri Lanka had also been a victim of terrorism and expressed gratitude for Pakistan’s steadfast support to the government in its fight against terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi stated that security relations between Pakistan and Sri Lanka had remained strong over the years and reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to further strengthening security cooperation with Sri Lanka.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi also met Sri Lankan Minister for Sports and Youth Affairs Sunil Kumara Gamage, with discussions focusing on enhancing cooperation in sports, particularly cricket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides agreed to strengthen collaboration between the respective sports ministries and promote bilateral cooperation in cricket and other sports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Naqvi stated that cricket and other sports would further strengthen bilateral relations. He also appreciated the excellent arrangements made during the T20 World Cup and thanked the Sri Lankan authorities for their hospitality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He extended an invitation to the Sri Lankan sports minister to visit Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh has invited Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend Tarique Rahman’s swearing-in as the country’s next leader, a gesture analysts say could help steady relations after months of strain between the neighbours.
Rahman’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) secured victory in last week’s national polls, paving the way for the long-time opposition leader to take office after years on the political sidelines.
Modi will not attend Tuesday’s ceremony because of prior commitments, but...</description>

      <title>Watch: Om Birla to attend Bangladesh PM Tarique Rahman’s oath ceremony</title>
      <link>https://www.thehindu.com/videos/watch-om-birla-to-attend-bangladesh-pm-tarique-rahmans-oath-ceremony/article70638291.ece</link>
      <description>India has nominated Om Birla to represent the country at the swearing-in ceremony of Bangladesh Nationalist Party leader Tarique Rahman as Prime Minister on February 17 in Dhaka. Prime Minister Narendra Modi declined the invitation due to prior commitments, including engagements with French President Emmanuel Macron. Rahman’s appointment follows the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024. Birla’s participation signals India’s intent to maintain continuity in bilateral ties, even as New Delhi cautiously evaluates its approach toward the new BNP-led government amid recent diplomatic strains.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal is set to attend the oath-taking ceremony of Bangladesh’s Prime Minister-elect Tarique Rahman of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), who won a landslide &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890&quot;&gt;victory&lt;/a&gt; in last week’s elections, the Foreign Office (FO) said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The election was the first since a deadly 2024 uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;ousted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina. Rahman is a scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement issued today, the FO said that Iqbal will represent Pakistan at the oath-taking ceremony, which is scheduled to be held on February 17 in Dhaka.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FO added that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was unable to attend “due to a prior overseas engagement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan’s participation in the ceremony reflects its support for Bangladesh’s democratic process and underscores its commitment to further strengthening bilateral relations and deepening mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries,” the statement added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman is the son of former Bangladeshi president Ziaur Rahman and the country’s former prime minister &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;Khaleda Zia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. He returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb 13, BNP won an overwhelming two-thirds majority in the country’s general elections. The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the election results last week, President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz extended their felicitations to the BNP and its leader, Rahman, on securing a landslide majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Zardari reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for the sovereignty and democratic aspirations of Bangladesh. While PM Shehbaz said he looked forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership and strengthening the two countries’ “historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s JI-led coalition submits poll complaints</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973578/bangladeshs-ji-led-coalition-submits-poll-complaints</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s Islamist-led coalition, which lost its chance to form the country’s next government in this week’s polls, submitted complaints to the Election Commission on Sunday, challenging results in 32 constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP),&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973288&quot;&gt; led&lt;/a&gt; by Tarique Rahman — the scion of one of the country’s most influential political dynasties — celebrated a sweeping victory in the South Asian nation of 170 million after general elections on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They were the first polls since a 2024 uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;ousted &lt;/a&gt;the autocratic government of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP alliance won 212 seats, compared with 77 for the Jamaat-e-Islami-led alliance, according to the Election Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The alliance identifies 32 constituencies where their candidates were ‘unfairly defeated’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman conceded on Saturday, saying his party would “serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Newly elected lawmakers are expected to be sworn in on Tuesday, after which Rahman is set to become the country’s next prime minister. But on Sunday, Jamaat officials submitted their complaints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have identified 32 constituencies where our candidates were unfairly defeated,” said senior Jamaat official Hamidur Rahman Azad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The election day began smoothly, but the ending was not what we had expected. Fake votes, the circulation of black money (bribes), threats, assaults, and attacks marred the atmosphere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police records show that political clashes during the campaign period left five people dead and more than 600 injured. But despite weeks of turbulence ahead of the polls, voting day passed without major unrest and the country has so far responded to the results with relative calm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least two people were killed in post-poll clashes, while scattered acts of vandalism and assaults were reported in several districts, police said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both Jamaat-e-Islami and ally the National Citizen Party (NCP) — formed by student leaders who spearheaded the uprising — reported attacks on their supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NCP loyalists marched through Dhaka University campus against the BNP on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police spokesman AHM Shahadat Hossain said that police were deployed to keep the peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over 150,000 police personnel were trained to tackle pre- and post-election violence,” Hossain said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Election Commission said turnout was 59 per cent across 299 of the 300 constituencies where voting was held.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only seven women were directly elected, although a further 50 seats reserved for women will be allocated to parties according to their share of the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Four members of minority communities won seats, including two Hindus — a population that makes up roughly seven percent in Muslim-majority Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;

In the last couple of months during the election campaign, a number of national and international media outlets have portrayed Jamaat as a significant force in the upcoming general elections, bolstered by youth support through its student wing, Islami Chattra Shibir, which has gained influence among student leaders, achieved positive results in campus elections, and taken advantage of the political vacuum left by the Awami League. However, the results at the polling station presented a different picture. Was the hype misplaced? Or was it part of a broader narrative that [&amp;#8230;]</description>

      <title>Pakistan to clash with India in T20 World Cup after off-field tumult calms</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;After weeks of tumult in the cricket arena, the world is finally getting to witness another Pakistan-India blockbuster match today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972941&quot;&gt;sold out&lt;/a&gt; the 35,000-capacity R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both Pakistan and India have won their first two group stage matches, the winners of Sunday’s match will be guaranteed of their berth in the Super Eights round.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was only confirmed as going ahead late on Monday night after the government &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086/pakistan-to-play-t20-world-cup-match-against-india-govt-announces&quot;&gt;reversed&lt;/a&gt; its &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421/pakistan-to-participate-in-t20-world-cup-but-will-not-play-against-india-on-feb-15&quot;&gt;decision to boycott&lt;/a&gt; the blockbuster Group A game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reversal followed protracted &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971869&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;negotiations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; between the International Cricket Council (ICC), the cricket boards of Pakistan and Bangladesh, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972204/pakistan-to-play-india-after-bdesh-compensated&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;consultations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; among national leaders, and interventions by friendly nations such as Sri Lanka and the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pakistan skipper &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973182&quot;&gt;Salman Agha said&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday his team had been “always ready” to face India, despite only being given the green light a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a very big game and the magnitude is huge,” Salman said ahead of the team’s practice at the stadium on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were always ready for the game, whatever be the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had a scrappy last-over three-wicket win in their first match against &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971793&quot;&gt;the Netherlands&lt;/a&gt; before &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972421&quot;&gt;beating the USA&lt;/a&gt; by 32 runs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“He has been cleared twice so there are no worries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman hoped the players would shake hands, unlike during the Asia Cup matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973199/t20-world-cup-suryakumar-says-india-vs-pakistan-not-just-another-game&quot;&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday that no matter how much his team tried to prepare for today’s clash against Pakistan as “just another game”, it would be much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big platform, obviously,” Suryakumar told reporters in Colombo. “No matter how much you say that it’s just another game, it is a big game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper added, “We don’t play them often, don’t even play them regularly. But at the end of the day, we try to keep things simple and try to execute our best game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is pressure, but there is a big opportunity,” he continued. “According to me, when you play an India-Pakistan game, it’s more about the occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suryakumar said opener Abhishek Sharma has recovered well from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972519&quot;&gt;stomach bug&lt;/a&gt; and was likely to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian captain played down the hype around Usman’s bowling action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have practised with similar types of bowlers and similar actions so we will try to execute what we are practising in the night sessions,” said Suryakumar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper would not say whether his players would shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts in Colombo today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will break the suspense tomorrow,” he said. “Wait for 24 hours, let us play the game which is more important.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;भारत के प्रति संतुलन बनाने के लिए यदि जानबूझकर Beijing या Islamabad की ओर झुकाव दिखाया जाता है, तो इससे New Delhi चिंतित होगा और पूरे क्षेत्र में ध्रुवीकरण का खतरा बढ़ेगा। Bangladesh की असली ताकत संतुलित कूटनीति में है—आर्थिक रूप से China से जुड़ाव, Pakistan के साथ संबंध बनाए रखना, लेकिन अपने तत्काल पड़ोस की नीति को India के साथ स्थिरता पर आधारित रखना।&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Salman hoped the players would shake hands, unlike during the Asia Cup matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#not-just-another-game&quot; id=&quot;not-just-another-game&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Not just another game’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973199/t20-world-cup-suryakumar-says-india-vs-pakistan-not-just-another-game&quot;&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday that no matter how much his team tried to prepare for today’s clash against Pakistan as “just another game”, it would be much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big platform, obviously,” Suryakumar told reporters in Colombo. “No matter how much you say that it’s just another game, it is a big game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper added, “We don’t play them often, don’t even play them regularly. But at the end of the day, we try to keep things simple and try to execute our best game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is pressure, but there is a big opportunity,” he continued. “According to me, when you play an India-Pakistan game, it’s more about the occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suryakumar said opener Abhishek Sharma has recovered well from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972519&quot;&gt;stomach bug&lt;/a&gt; and was likely to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian captain played down the hype around Usman’s bowling action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have practised with similar types of bowlers and similar actions so we will try to execute what we are practising in the night sessions,” said Suryakumar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper would not say whether his players would shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts in Colombo today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will break the suspense tomorrow,” he said. “Wait for 24 hours, let us play the game which is more important.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>India and Bangladesh Cannot Wish Away Each Other: Why BNP Must Reset Relations with India</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/india-and-bangladesh-cannot-wish-away-each-other-why-bnp-must-reset-relations-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A deliberate drift toward Beijing or Islamabad as counterweights to India would alarm New Delhi and risk regional polarization. Bangladesh’s strength lies in balanced diplomacy—engaging China economically, maintaining relations with Pakistan, but grounding its immediate neighborhood policy in stability with India.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh’s new BNP-led government has formally congratulated Narendra Modi and may invite him to its swearing-in, signalling a possible reset in India–Bangladesh ties.

      <title>Jackson Heights in New York buzzes with hope as Bangladesh embraces democracy</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973331/jackson-heights-in-new-york-buzzes-with-hope-as-bangladesh-embraces-democracy</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON: In New York, the Jackson Heights neighbourhood is alive with smells and sounds that evoke home: hilsa frying in mustard oil, &lt;em&gt;khajur gurr&lt;/em&gt; stacked beside jars of &lt;em&gt;achar&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;sari&lt;/em&gt; shops glittering with Tangail cottons and Jamdani silks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chatter of Bangla in every accent — from the clipped tones of Shudhu Bangla to the soft drawl of Noakhali and the rolling lilt of Chittagong — further authenticated the atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Restaurants serving Bengali biryani and pakoras sit side by side with Pakistani eateries. Mosques are filled with worshippers preparing for Ramazan, with banners welcoming the holy month and offers of free iftar visible on doors and gates.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This vibrant diaspora community, the largest Bangladeshi settlement in North America, marked the&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973288/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-thanks-those-who-fought-for-democracy&quot;&gt; elections&lt;/a&gt; and welcomed the results with a festive yet reflective mood. Residents had long participated in protests outside the United Nations headquarters against Sheikh Hasina Wajed’s government. The neighbourhood has Awami League supporters too, but most are silent for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are hoping that it will bring stability and prosperity to Bangladesh,” said Abul Hassan, a longtime shopkeeper. “We Bangladeshis have proven time and again that we do not tolerate tyranny. Hasina Wajed failed because she became a tyrant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hassan said most in Jackson Heights support the BNP, though some also admire Jamaat-e-Islami. Rasheed Ahmed, who runs a clothing store, called Jamaat’s success “a historic achievement for them anywhere in South Asia,” expressing hope it could play a constructive role in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#the-rise-of-political-islam&quot; id=&quot;the-rise-of-political-islam&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The rise of political Islam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s victory was widely expected in Jackson Heights too, even before the Awami League was barred from the contest, leaving Bangladesh’s largest opposition party with a clear path. Jamaat-e-Islami’s gain of around 70 seats, however, has stunned analysts and raised concerns about the rise of political Islam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taj Hashmi, a Toronto-based historian and Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society, stressed the structural factors behind these results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The BNP’s win was predictable,” he said. “Eighteen years of political exclusion cannot erase deep-rooted grassroots networks. Anti-incumbency sentiment was enough to secure their return.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While a formidable party like the Awami League was absent from the poll (for the right or wrong reasons), it was obvious that it would benefit the largest political party, the BNP,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What’s surprising is that the Jamaat-e-Islami, who never ever polled more than 4 to 7 per cent of the vote in Bangladesh since 1979, has captured around 70 seats in the parliament.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jamaat’s gains, he added: “The Jamaat’s rise reflects not only protest votes but the growing influence of political Islam among marginalised communities. Socioeconomic deprivation, unemployment, and decades of perceived injustice created fertile ground for their ideology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hashmi highlighted the party’s historical persecution: “Under Hasina, Jamaat leaders were executed or imprisoned on charges dating back to 1971. That repression, while intended to weaken them, instead fortified their narrative as a party of martyrs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was candid about the party’s ideology: “Jamaat’s intellectual roots lie in a vision of an Islamic state that is anti-individualist, and opposed to gender equality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding nuance, he noted: “Political Islam has been rising gradually, but it was exacerbated by Hasina’s heavy-handed rule. People seek alternatives, and even if Jamaat’s agenda is concerning, their parliamentary presence now is a reflection of deeper societal currents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Mohammad Imran Hossain, a visiting professor from Dhaka in New York, framed the elections in terms of regional diplomacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In recent years, Bangladesh–Pakistan relations have been formal but cautious,” the executive director of Bangladesh Institute of Development and Security Studies said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A BNP-led government could normalise ties incrementally, focusing on trade, flights, and pragmatic engagement — while still balancing the vital relationship with India.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prof. Imran cautioned that changes would be measured: “Dramatic breakthroughs are unlikely. Progress depends on mutual respect and the ability to manage the legacy of 1971. If both sides see strategic value, relations could improve steadily within broader regional frameworks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imran also highlighted the domestic dimension: “The rise of Jamaat, while politically significant, could challenge governance. BNP will need to ensure democratic norms while integrating these actors responsibly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added: “The BNP’s foreign policy orientation will likely be pro-China and cautious toward India. That may unsettle New Delhi but could provide space for Bangladesh to diversify partnerships.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Observations from Washington&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;US Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s congratulatory message sounded cautious and formal. “Congratulations to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and its leader Tarique Rahman as well as the people of Bangladesh. The United States looks forward to working with the newly elected government to advance prosperity and the security of the region,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN emphasised inclusive participation while noting intimidation and harassment of women candidates, including in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michael Kugelman, a Washington-based scholar of South Asian affairs, described the process as peaceful, with strong turnout and no parties threatening to reject the results — a “significant step for democratisation,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BNP landslide a breakthrough and test for Bangladesh</title>

&lt;p&gt;In winning the 13th national parliamentary election, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) capitalized on a rare convergence of public exhaustion and strategic patience. Its 212-seat landslide was harvested through moments it had spent nearly two decades preparing for. At the heart of this victory was a national mood defined less by optimism than by fatigue.

      <title>After off-field uproar settled, Pakistan set to clash with India</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973295/after-off-field-uproar-settled-pakistan-set-to-clash-with-india</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;COLOMBO: Brace yourself. Another Pakistan-India cricket blockbuster is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arch-rivals will clash in the T20 World Cup Group ‘A’ match in Colombo on Sunday, still feeling the aftershocks of a tumultuous fortnight in which Pakistan’s boycott call, which was later &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;reversed&lt;/a&gt;, nearly blew a hole in the tournament’s marquee fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With bilateral cricket a casualty of their fraught relations, emotions run high whenever the bitter neighbours lock horns in multi-team events at neutral venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s strained relations with another neighbour, Bangladesh, have further tangled the geopolitics around the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968793&quot;&gt;replaced by Scotland&lt;/a&gt; in the 20-team field for refusing to tour India over safety concerns, the regional chessboard shifted. The Pakistan government, in solidarity with Bangladesh, decided to boycott the match against India, a move that could jeopardise a highly lucrative fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan reversed its decision of the Feb 15 game boycott on Monday night only after hectic negotiations involving top officials of the Pakistan Cricket Board, International Cricket Council and the Bangladesh Cricket Board in Lahore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly on cricketing merit, however, the rivalry has remained one-sided in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defending champions India have a 7-1 record against Pakistan in the tournament’s history and they underlined that dominance at last year’s Asia Cup in the UAE. India beat Pakistan three times in that single event, including a stormy final marred by provocative gestures and snubbed handshakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‘ALWAYS READY FOR INDIA’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan skipper Salman Agha said on Saturday his team had been “always ready” to face India on Sunday at the T20 World Cup, despite only being given the green light a few days ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest and most lucrative clash in world cricket has sold out the 35,000-capacity R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo with hundreds of millions more expected to watch on television.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is a very big game and the magnitude is huge,” Salman said ahead of the team’s practice at the stadium on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We were always ready for the game, whatever be the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan had a scrappy last-over three-wicket win in their first match against the Netherlands before beating the USA by 32 runs.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are in good momentum and I hope that being in Colombo since the start will help us in terms of conditions,” said Salman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hugely anticipated match could be hit by bad weather, with rain forecast for Sunday evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan skipper believed spin would dominate, calling off-spinner Usman Tariq his trump card against India’s powerful batting line-up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Usman has been bowling well and I am sure the mystery element will make him our trump card,” Salman said, brushing aside doubts over the legality of Usman’s unique sling-arm action and the exaggerated pause in his delivery stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He has been cleared twice so there are no worries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Salman hoped the players would shake hands, unlike during the Asia Cup matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The game should be played in the true spirit of the game,” he said. “It has been the norm in cricket for years but whatever way they want, we will only know tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As both Pakistan and India have won their first two group stage matches, the winners of Sunday’s match will be guaranteed of their berth in the Super Eights round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOT JUST ANOTHER GAME: SURYAKUMAR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1973199&quot;&gt;admitted&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday that no matter how much his team tried to prepare for Sunday’s T20 World Cup clash against Pakistan as “just another game”, it would be much more than that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a big platform, obviously,” Suryakumar told reporters in Colombo. “No matter how much you say that it’s just another game, it is a big game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper added, “We don’t play them often, don’t even play them regularly. But at the end of the day, we try to keep things simple and try to execute our best game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is pressure, but there is a big opportunity,” he continued. “According to me, when you play an India-Pakistan game, it’s more about the occasion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suryakumar said opener Abhishek Sharma has recovered well from a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972519&quot;&gt;stomach bug&lt;/a&gt; and was likely to play. The big-hitting 25-year-old, who skipped the Namibia match due to the health problem, batted in the nets on Saturday, which indicates the left-hander is in the frame for the high-octane Sunday clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian captain played down the hype around Usman’s bowling action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We have practised with similar types of bowlers and similar actions so we will try to execute what we are practising in the night sessions,” said Suryakumar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Indian skipper would not say whether his players would shake hands with their Pakistan counterparts in Colombo today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I will break the suspense tomorrow,” he said. “Wait for 24 hours, let us play the game which is more important.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Bangladesh’s PM-to-be pledges to restore governance, economy; vows to fix ‘broken’ systems&lt;br /&gt;• Urges unity as BNP sweeps first polls since 2024 uprising&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DHAKA: Bangladesh’s prime minister-in-waiting &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday dedicated his party’s landslide election &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890/bangladeshs-bnp-wins-big-in-historic-parliamentary-election&quot;&gt;victory &lt;/a&gt;to the citizens who “sacrificed for democracy” during the deadly 2024 uprising and pledged to prioritise the restoration of economy and governance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, the 60-year-old scion of one of the nation’s most powerful political dynasties, called for national unity as he prepared to lead the South Asian nation of 170 million people following the Bangladesh Nationalist Party’s sweeping success in Thursday’s vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He will take over from an interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, which has steered Bangladesh since a student-led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1867302&quot;&gt;uprising &lt;/a&gt;ousted Hasina in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This victory belongs to Bangladesh, belongs to democracy,” Rahman said in his first speech since the vote. “This victory belongs to people who aspire to and have sacrificed for democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Election Commission reported the BNP alliance won 212 seats, securing a decisive two-thirds majority compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance. Turnout was reported at 59 per cent across 299 constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The win marks a remarkable turnaround for Rahman, who returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years of exile in Britain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he emphasised that the new government faces “daunting challenges”, putting the restoration of governance and the stabilisation of the financial sector at the top of his agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We are about to begin our journey in a situation marked by a fragile economy left behind by an authoritarian regime, weakening constitutional and structural institutions, and destroying law and order,” Rahman said. “We have very serious challenges to face … tackle the economy of the country … to ensure good governance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters on Thursday also endorsed a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus through a concurrent referendum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approved reforms include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence intended to prevent a return to one-party rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from participating in the polls. Speaking from hiding in India, the 78-year-old former leader — sentenced to death in absentia for crimes against humanity — issued a statement decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conversely, Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, whose party quadrupled its seats in parliament, conceded on Saturday despite initially alleging “inconsistencies”. He pledged to serve as a “vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman urged political rivals to work together following the tumultuous transition. “Our paths and opinions may differ, but in the interest of the country, we must remain united,” Rahman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman is the son of former President Ziaur Rahman and former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, who&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt; died &lt;/a&gt;last year. While rivals have criticised his political career for alleged corruption, charges he has denied, his party’s commanding majority is viewed by analysts as a crucial opportunity to restore political stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The freedom-loving, pro-democracy people of the country have once again brought victory to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party,” Rahman said.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>COMMENT: Oxygen of world cricket is back</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973299/comment-oxygen-of-world-cricket-is-back</link>
      <description>&lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-full  media--center    media--uneven  media--stretch&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/6990f5b8366fd.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;THE cricket world held its breath for one week when Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970749&quot;&gt;threatened&lt;/a&gt; to boycott its T20 World Cup group stage fixture against India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But with back-channel talks having broken the deadlock between the stakeholders, on Sunday evening at the R. Pre­madasa Stadium, it will exhale in one collective roar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan versus India in a T20 World Cup is not merely a match; it is the fixture that keeps the sport’s heartbeat strong. Whatever the result, the game will remind millions why they fell in love with cricket in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The venue itself is part of the narrative. The Premadasa Stadium has hosted many thrillers, but rarely one carrying this much baggage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan to face India today&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A used pitch — likely the same surface on which Zimbabwe&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972974/zimbabwe-upset-australia-arsenal-drop-points-ratcliffe-under-review-dawn-news-english&quot;&gt; humbled &lt;/a&gt;Australia on Friday — awaits the two teams. It is slow, grippy and low. In such conditions the ball holds in the surface, turns a fraction and rewards the bowler who can vary pace and trajectory. Spin, not raw pace, will decide the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both sides have recognised the shift. India will lean on Varun Chakravarthy’s mystery, Axar Patel’s left-arm control and may also throw in Kuldeep Yadav’s wrist-spin — which has worried Pakistan over the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan will counter with a carousel of their own: Shadab Khan, Abrar Ahmed, Mohammad Nawaz and, most intriguingly, the 30-year-old off-spinner Usman Tariq.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usman’s action has been the talk of the tournament. The brief pause at the crease, the low-arm sling, the ball that skids or dips — it has left batters guessing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has already been reported twice and cleared twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha calls him the “trump card”. In the spin-friendly Colombo air, that card could be decisive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Usman lands his variations on the money, even India’s middle order — Suryakumar Yadav, Hardik Pandya, Rinku Singh — may find the boundaries suddenly distant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet Pakistan cannot rely on spin alone. The fast-bowling equation presents its own conundrum. Shaheen Shah Afridi remains the marquee name, the leader of the attack, the man who has delivered in big games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the left-arm seamer Salman Mirza has been impressive in the lead-up, generating swing and hitting the deck hard. Conditions on Sunday may not offer extravagant movement, yet the temptation to play both, or to prefer Mirza’s current rhythm over Shaheen’s experience, is real. The management must decide whether sentiment or data guides the playing XI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan’s batting, meanwhile, carries familiar vulnerabilities. The top order has fired in the first two matches, with Sahibzada Farhan and Saim Ayub providing brisk starts. But Salman Agha and former skipper Babar Azam have to make better contributions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Against India’s varied batting line-up, especially if Abhishek Sharma is fit, any collapse could prove fatal. Abhishek, the explosive left-hander, missed India’s game again Namibia with a stomach infection. He has since been cleared and insists he is fit. If he walks out at the top, the powerplay could belong to India in a hurry. Weather adds another layer of uncertainty. Colombo has been humid, and forecasts speak of a low-pressure system lingering over the Bay of Bengal. Morning and afternoon showers are possible; the evening is expected to be overcast but largely dry, with temperatures hovering around 27-28°C and humidity in the low-to-mid 70s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Political factor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Off the field, the political backdrop is impossible to ignore. Only days ago Pakistan had threatened to boycott the contest in solidarity with Bangladesh after the latter’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968999&quot;&gt;exclusion&lt;/a&gt; from the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intensive negotiations in Lahore involving the International Cricket Council (ICC), the Pakistan Cricket Board and its Bangladesh counterpart produced a last-minute reversal as the ICC gave in to a few demands put forward by the PCB and the BCB. Now, fresh reports suggest that representatives of the BCB, PCB, the Afghanistan Cricket Board and the Board of Control for Cricket in India may hold informal meetings on the sidelines of Sunday’s game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains to be seen whether those conversations yield concrete results on bilateral cricket or future tournaments. But the very fact they are happening in Colombo underlines how deeply intertwined sport and diplomacy have become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, the challenge is clear. They enter as slight underdogs India have won 13 of the last 16 T20I meetings yet the conditions are more even than at any recent clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Premadasa Stadium is unlikely to be a 200-run ground on Sunday; 160-170 may be a fighting total. Discipline with the bat, control with the ball and, above all, composure under the weight of expectation will separate the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Green Shirts have the tools. Usman’s variations, the left-arm pace dilemma, a settled top order and the knowledge that they have already beaten strong sides in this tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But India remain the benchmark — clinical, deep and ruthless when the big moments arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Come Sunday evening, 35,000 spectators will pack the Premadasa, millions more will tune in across the Subcontinent and beyond, and the world will remember why this fixture still matters. Win, lose or tie, cricket will be the richer for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oxygen is back. Let the match begin.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CRICKET: REBALANCING CRICKET</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973281/cricket-rebalancing-cricket</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It was never going to be easy for the International Cricket Council (ICC) to sideline Pakistan from the T20 World Cup, let alone exclude them from the marquee clash against India. That is precisely why, today on February 15, Pakistan will take on India for the ninth time in T20 World Cup history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a rivalry in which Pakistan has managed only one victory so far. Yet win numbers barely matter when these two teams meet, because this contest has grown far beyond cricket and has become arguably the most anticipated fixture in global sport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the build-up to this match, uncertainty loomed large. Until just days before the game, there was no official confirmation that Pakistan would play. This followed a dramatic political intervention when the Government of Pakistan announced that it would not permit the Pakistan team to participate in the World Cup group-stage match against India. Despite the tournament featuring 20 teams, this single lucrative fixture dominated headlines across the cricketing world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tension had been sparked when Bangladesh approached the ICC, requesting that their World Cup matches be shifted out of India due to political and security concerns. The ICC rejected this request, citing operational challenges, and eventually removed Bangladesh from the tournament, replacing them with Scotland. This decision sent shockwaves through the cricket community and raised serious questions about fairness and consistency in governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The most anticipated match in the ongoing T20 World Cup, Pakistan versus India today, almost didn’t happen. But the issue was always about more than a single match. It was about respect, equity and the balance of power in international cricket&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Pakistan emerged as the only major cricketing nation willing to stand publicly in solidarity with Bangladesh. Pakistan’s position was rooted in recent precedent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 2025 Champions Trophy, India refused to travel to Pakistan and the ICC allowed their matches to be played at a neutral venue in the UAE. Similarly, in the 2026 T20 World Cup, Pakistan was already playing all its matches in Sri Lanka rather than India. Given this background, many believed that Bangladesh deserved the same consideration rather than outright exclusion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan government took a firm stance and instructed the national team not to play India unless the issue was addressed. This moment marked a rare instance of a powerful cricket board openly challenging both the ICC and the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sky Sports, former England captain and respected commentator Nasser Hussain weighed in on the controversy. He remarked that it was difficult to imagine the ICC treating India the same way if they had refused to play in a host country at short notice. He further stated that Pakistan was speaking to the ICC and BCCI in the only language that truly moves world cricket, financial leverage and commercial reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hussain also expressed admiration for both Bangladesh and Pakistan, praising Bangladesh for taking a principled stand and Pakistan for defending another full member of the ICC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The situation reached a turning point on Sunday, February 8, when the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) president and the ICC deputy chairman travelled to Pakistan for high-level talks with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chairman Mohsin Naqvi. These discussions proved crucial and, by Monday evening, a resolution began to take shape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the meeting, the BCB formally requested Pakistan to proceed with the match against India on February 15. Shortly after, the ICC issued a detailed press release outlining key assurances, including recognition of Bangladesh as a valued full member with a proud cricketing heritage, confirmation that their absence from the 2026 World Cup would not harm their long-term cricketing future and a commitment to continue supporting cricket development in Bangladesh, a nation of over 200 million passionate fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, the ICC confirmed that no financial, sporting or administrative penalties would be imposed on Bangladesh. The BCB also retained the right to approach the ICC Dispute Resolution Committee if it chose to do so. Additionally, Bangladesh was guaranteed hosting rights for an ICC event between 2028 and 2031, ahead of the 2031 Men’s Cricket World Cup, subject to standard procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following this resolution, the Government of Pakistan officially announced on social media platform X that Pakistan would indeed play India today. This marked a historic moment in cricket diplomacy, where one board stood up for another in the name of fairness and equality among ICC members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite this positive outcome, a misleading narrative began circulating in the Indian media. Several outlets portrayed Pakistan as backing down or surrendering under pressure. This interpretation was far from the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that India versus Pakistan matches in ICC tournaments generate immense global viewership and revenue. Broadcasters, sponsors, the ICC, BCCI and PCB all benefit significantly from this rivalry. Even during periods of intense public hostility, such as the 2025 Asia Cup, India ultimately played Pakistan despite political tensions at home. At that time, Indian players refused to shake hands as a symbolic gesture, yet they still participated because a full boycott was simply not commercially viable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What made this situation different was that Pakistan became the first team to openly risk financial losses and potential ICC sanctions by threatening to withdraw from the biggest match in world cricket. This was not a retreat but a calculated stand based on principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, the ICC was never in a position to simply remove or punish Pakistan the way it did with Bangladesh, even though this was exactly what many in India, particularly sections of Indian media and officials close to the BCCI, were hoping for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kicking Pakistan out of a global event was never going to be straightforward, because Pakistan is one half of the biggest rivalry in world cricket, a rivalry that generates enormous revenue, viewership, sponsorship and broadcast value for every ICC tournament. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The India versus Pakistan contest is not just another match, it is one of the most commercially powerful fixtures in international sport and the entire financial model of ICC events benefits heavily from its existence. Broadcasters pay premium rights fees largely because of this match-up. Sponsors invest more when these two teams meet. And host countries rely on this game to maximise ticket sales and global engagement. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this, the ICC had to handle Pakistan’s stance with far greater caution and diplomacy than it did with Bangladesh, as any harsh action against Pakistan would have directly damaged the tournament’s commercial appeal and credibility. Unlike Bangladesh, Pakistan sits at the centre of the most profitable rivalry in cricket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In truth, all three parties, Pakistan, India and the ICC, ultimately wanted this match to go ahead. However, Pakistan ensured that the ICC and BCCI acknowledged the need for fair treatment of all member nations rather than selective enforcement based on power or politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, this episode became a win-win situation. Bangladesh secured a future ICC hosting opportunity without any penalties, while Pakistan demonstrated leadership, solidarity and moral courage. More importantly, Pakistan proved that it is not merely a participant in world cricket but a nation willing to challenge the system when fairness is at stake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not just about a single match. It was about respect, equity and the balance of power in international cricket. And on that front, Pakistan emerged with its reputation not only intact but strengthened.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Population surge threatens growth, warns Aurangzeb</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973310/population-surge-threatens-growth-warns-aurangzeb</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;• Insists govt can’t create jobs for millions of people; private sector must lead employment drive&lt;br /&gt;
• Claims FIR registered against sitting senator over alleged tax evasion&lt;br /&gt;
• Says tobacco sector ‘not paying taxes’, involved in smuggling&lt;br /&gt;
• Construction relief package ‘in pipeline’, announcement expected soon&lt;br /&gt;
• Textile support under review; minister seeks 10-12 days for concrete steps&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAHORE: Finance Minister Muha­mmad Aurangzeb on Saturday warned that Pakistan could not be run with a rapidly increasing population and stressed that the private sector would have to take the lead and create employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“If this growth rate (2.5pc) continues, our population can reach 400 million in the coming years. So, you tell us who will run this country in such a situation,” he said while speaking at the Pakistan Economic Growth Conference at the regional office of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) in Lahore. “So please help us on how to control the population,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On employment, the minister said the government alone could not provide jobs to the entire population of 250 million. “The private sector should lead the country’s economy and provide jobs,” he said, adding that the government’s role was to strengthen and enable the private sector. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The minister emphasised the need to adopt the strategy that Bangladesh had used to control its population. “When you talk about Bangladesh with reference to taxation, competitiveness, growth, etc, while comparing with Pakistan, why don’t you talk about its journey to control population,” he questioned, requesting the businesspersons to come forward and help the government reduce the population growth.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Aurangzeb said the government was making efforts to broaden the tax base, claiming that an FIR had been registered against a sitting senator over alleged tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tobacco and cigarette companies, except for two, are not paying taxes. They are also involved in smuggling. But we are not sparing them. We got an FIR even against a sitting senator,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the government had started monitoring sales tax on goods starting with the sugar industry and would move to other sectors in phases. “The PM has instructed us to start this from the sugar industry since his family is engaged in this [sugar] business,” Mr Aurangzeb claimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finance minister said that after economic stabilisation, industrialisation was essential for sustainable growth and reiterated that the government was pursuing an export-led policy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said relief measures for the construction sector were in the pipeline and would soon be announced by the prime minister, while support for the textile sector and possible reductions in taxes linked to the property sector were also under consideration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said digitisation would improve transparency and revenue collection and acknowledged that the salaried class bore a disproportionate share of the tax burden. He reiterated the government’s commitment to providing relief to salaried individuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Highlighting developments in the construction sector, the finance minister said the work was actively underway and efforts were being made to broaden the tax net.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He clarified that the real estate and construction sectors were being treated separately, adding that construction was linked with multiple allied industries. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He assured the business community that their issues would be addressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking on the textile sector, he said that its issues were currently under review and requested 10 to 12 more days, assuring that concrete steps would be announced shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He further stated that the government was reviewing the possibility of reducing multiple taxes in the property sector while carefully balancing fiscal responsibilities with sectoral demands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr Aurangzeb said that the positive impact of Pakistan’s agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has begun to materialise, restoring the confidence of international financial institutions in Pakistan’s economy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said the country was now firmly on the path of stability and growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that difficult but necessary decisions were taken to ensure fiscal discipline, particularly when Pakistan faced the risk of default. While the 2022 floods severely affected the economy, he said the country had sufficient capacity to absorb the losses caused by the 2025 floods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finance minister described IT exports as the future of Pakistan’s economy, stating that current IT exports stood at $3-4 billion, with the potential to reach $8-10bn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He stressed that export proceeds must be fully repatriated, as a significant portion — around $4-5bn — was currently retained abroad. He further stated that foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan were increasing consistently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Due to prudent government policies, inflation has declined to record lows, providing tangible relief to the general public,” he said, reiterating that the salaried class would continue to receive priority relief measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier, former minister Gohar Ejaz expressed concern over heavy taxation on real estate and other sectors, saying it was pushing investment abroad, particularly to Dubai.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Pakistani people have already purchased properties worth $100bn in Dubai. A property expo for investment in Dubai is also being held in Lahore. And this city, after Karachi and other major cities, will be empty soon,” he deplored, requesting the government to reduce taxes on real estate and other sectors for economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Held on 12 February 2026, the poll followed the 2024 student-led uprising that forced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg3ee303yxpo&quot;&gt;Sheikh Hasina from office&lt;/a&gt; and ushered in an interim administration under Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the Bangladesh Election Commission, BNP and its allies won 212 of the 300 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad (national parliament), securing a two-thirds majority, far surpassing the 151 required to form government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-e-Islami (JI) and its allies secured 77 seats, including six won by the National Citizen Party (NCP), a formation led by figures from the student uprising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNP chairman Tarique Rahman is now poised to become prime minister after more than 17 years in exile, completing one of the most dramatic political comebacks in recent Bangladeshi history.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrested in 2007, later exiled to the United Kingdom, and long shadowed by corruption allegations he denies, Rahman returned to Bangladesh in December 2025 to contest his first parliamentary election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his first address to the nation after the victory, he said: “This victory belongs to Bangladesh. It belongs to democracy. It belongs to the people who have aspired to and sacrificed for democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Former leader Hasina’s Awami League (AL) was officially barred from contesting the election following the uprising that ousted her after &lt;a href=&quot;https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1160046&quot;&gt;security forces killed at least 1,400 protesters.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upheaval triggered a transitional legal process targeting senior figures in her government. In May 2025, the interim administration suspended the party’s registration pending investigations into allegations of electoral manipulation, abuse of state power and human rights violations during its final years in office, effectively preventing the AL from fielding candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exiled in India, Hasina dismissed the election as a “deception and a farce”, arguing that a vote conducted without her party’s participation could not be considered fully democratic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Reclaiming the right to choose&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After more than a decade in which elections were widely criticised as coercive or predetermined, stepping into a polling booth carried emotional weight for many Bangladeshis. The 2024 uprising had broken open a political order, but it had also ushered in a fragile transitional period in which law and order felt unsettled and the future unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;A large parliamentary majority creates an opportunity for reform, but also the temptation to centralise power and sideline dissent&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Anu Muhammad, political economist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across districts, voters described a mix of relief and cautious hope. “For years we stood in line and felt nothing would change,” Mohammad Salam, a 38-year-old shopkeeper in Bogura told Middle East Eye. “Today, at least, I felt my vote would be counted.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Dhaka, Mehruba Akhter, a first-time voter, linked the ballot directly to the people’s uprising. “We were on the streets demanding change,” she said. “Now we are trying to shape that change.”&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writer and researcher Altaf Parvez told MEE that lower- and middle-income citizens participated in large numbers in both the July uprising and elections. “Their participation carried a single message: a desire for change,” he said. “Eighteen months ago, they demanded change with blood. This time, they repeated that demand through ballots.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parvez described the election as a direct outcome of the uprising and argued that the new parliament must “repay the debt to the martyrs” by undertaking substantive steps, from police reform and economic restructuring to rehabilitating public administration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Political economist Anu Muhammad echoed that sense of historic responsibility but cautioned against complacency.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“A large parliamentary majority creates an opportunity for reform, but also the temptation to centralise power and sideline dissent,” he told MEE, recalling similar landslide victories in 2001 and 2008 that later eroded democratic norms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;A rightward shift&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the election restored competitive politics, it also revealed how far the centre of gravity has shifted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh’s chapter of the most prevalent Islamist political party in the Indian subcontinent, emerged from the vote as the second-largest bloc in parliament. Its 77 seats, secured with its allies, were its strongest parliamentary showing in the country’s history.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once marginalised and, at times, formally restricted from political participation, JI re-entered the electoral arena after the 2024 rupture with organisational discipline, financial resources and a sharpened ideological message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Researchers note that the transition period created space for religious and right-wing actors to assert themselves more visibly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Parvez says that JI reorganised itself “with remarkable efficiency,” transforming from what had been a fourth-tier electoral force into a credible competitor to major parties in multiple constituencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its campaign leaned heavily on themes of moral order, anti-corruption and administrative discipline, messaging that resonated in a period marked by economic stress and institutional distrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, JI&apos;s rise has intensified scrutiny of its position on women and public life. JI’s leader has stated unequivocally in past speeches that women should not occupy the highest executive offices of the state.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a controversial post on X, he also likened women working outside the home to “prostitution”, a remark that drew a sharp backlash before he later claimed his account had been hacked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“[Jamaat] will not be able to confine women to their homes again, and must offer a public apology with folded hands,” leftist student activist Sayera Chandra Chakma told MEE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For many women, particularly younger and urban voters who mobilised during the 2024 uprising, JI&apos;s expanded parliamentary presence signals a renewed contest over whether women’s equality in Bangladesh is negotiable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samina Lutfa, professor of sociology at the University of Dhaka, argued that tactical alliances between segments of the student-led National Citizen Party (NCP) and JI may have alienated parts of the urban, younger women’s constituency that had mobilised during the 2024 uprising with hopes of a broader, more inclusive civic space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She described the shift as a return to “old-style power politics”, warning that the pursuit of parliamentary advantage risked diluting the moral force of July.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her view, sections of the post-uprising leadership failed to take a principled stand against episodes of mob mobilisation during periods of instability, only later repositioning themselves as inheritors of the movement’s legacy. “Claiming the uprising’s symbolism without shouldering its responsibility,” she suggested, “has weakened public trust.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, the election has institutionalised a rightward current that had been gathering momentum since the uprising. Competitive democracy has returned, but so has sharper ideological contestation, particularly over the meaning of pluralism, secularism and gender equality in Bangladesh’s political future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Women’s representation: participation without power&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While women voted in large numbers, their representation in parliament remains starkly low. Of 300 directly elected seats, only seven women won - just over 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&apos;We did not beg. We asked for what is rightfully ours&apos;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;- Seuty Sabur, Brac University&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The imbalance began at nomination, long before ballots were cast. According to election data, 30 of the 51 political parties, including JI, did not nominate a single woman candidate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The July Charter, which emerged from a very male-dominated post-uprising consensus process, sets only a 5 percent threshold for women’s representation in candidate nominations, a target that activists argue falls far short of both the 30 percent requirement under existing electoral law and long-standing demands for one-third representation in parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Women have been underrepresented, and political parties have miserably failed to ensure women’s representation,” Seuty Sabur, associate professor of anthropology at Brac University, told MEE. “Many of us were angry and exhausted from reminding parties of their duties. Women were left alone to fend for themselves in claiming equal citizen rights.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She noted that women’s groups had demanded 33 percent representation, proportional inclusion in consecutive terms and direct elections for reserved seats. “We did not beg,” she said. “We asked for what is rightfully ours.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Sabur, the election brings mixed emotions. “The only sigh of relief is that the election happened and anti-liberation forces [those who resisted the liberation war of Bangladesh in 1971] are not the majority. For now, we can breathe a little while continuing to build inclusive spaces.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Mandate and path to reform&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside the parliamentary election, voters were asked whether they supported a package of constitutional reforms proposed in the aftermath of the July 2024 uprising.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to the election commission, 48 million voters chose “yes” and 22.5 million voted “no”, out of nearly 77 million ballots cast, a turnout of just over 60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the proposal passed comfortably nationwide, the “no” vote prevailed in 11 constituencies.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before polling day, some civil society groups had criticised the design of the referendum itself. Lawyers, academics and rights advocates noted that 84 reform proposals were bundled into a single yes or no question, limiting granular debate and informed choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In some constituencies, voters said they remained uncertain about the full scope of what a “yes” or “no” vote would mean in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, the scale of the “yes” vote provides the incoming parliament with a reform mandate that is politically difficult to dismiss. Unlike referendums held under military rule in 1977 and 1985, which produced near-unanimous approval, or the low-turnout constitutional vote of 1991, this referendum took place alongside a competitive national election and yielded a more differentiated outcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Although the outcome does not settle every constitutional debate, it signals public endorsement of structural change,” said Parvez.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next phase will determine how that mandate is interpreted. Constitutional reform is expected to move through parliamentary committees, potentially including a dedicated constitutional reform council as envisaged in post-uprising discussions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key areas under consideration include rebalancing executive power, strengthening parliamentary oversight, reforming policing and public administration and revisiting provisions related to decentralisation and judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How inclusive that process becomes, particularly whether minority representatives, indigenous leaders, women’s groups and opposition parties are substantively involved, will shape its legitimacy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A supermajority gives BNP the numerical capacity to amend the constitution, but the durability of reform will depend on the consultation process. If pursued unilaterally, it risks reopening the cycle of constitutional centralisation that has defined much of Bangladesh’s recent political history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For now, Bangladesh has completed a largely peaceful and broadly accepted electoral contest. But the deeper verdict lies ahead. With a decisive majority in hand, BNP faces a familiar test: whether it will use its mandate to institutionalise accountability and pluralism, or repeat cycles of centralisation and backlash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The electorate has signalled its desire for change, first through protest, now through ballots. As one elderly voter put it quietly outside a polling centre: “We have done our part. Now they must do theirs.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh’s Tarique Rahman poised to be PM as Jamaat-i-Islami concedes</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973173/bangladeshs-tarique-rahman-poised-to-be-pm-as-jamaat-i-islami-concedes</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) party conceded defeat in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890/bangladeshs-bnp-wins-sweeping-election-majority-promises-stability&quot;&gt;elections&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, despite earlier alleging problems with the vote count, clearing the way for nationalist leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; to become prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commission figures showed Rahman’s Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) had won a landslide victory in the elections on Thursday, the first since a deadly 2024 uprising &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ousted&lt;/a&gt; the iron-fisted rule of Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The success of BNP chief Rahman, 60, marks a remarkable turnaround for a man who only &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; to Bangladesh in December after 17 years in exile in Britain, far from Dhaka’s political storms.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, the scion of one of Bangladesh’s most powerful political dynasties, is expected to make a victory speech later on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His father, president Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated in 1981, while his mother, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1964087&quot;&gt;Khaleda Zia&lt;/a&gt;, served three terms as prime minister and dominated national politics for decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, who has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;led&lt;/a&gt; the country of 170 million as interim leader since the uprising, said Rahman “would help guide the country toward stability, inclusiveness, and development”.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP alliance won 212 seats compared with 77 for the Jamaat-i-Islami-led alliance, according to the Electoral Commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, had said on Friday he would “seek redress” from the commission, with his party alleging “inconsistencies and fabrications”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a day later, he conceded defeat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In any genuine democratic journey, the true test of leadership is not only how we campaign, but how we respond to the verdict of the people,” the Jamaat leader said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We recognise the overall outcome, and we respect the rule of law.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina’s Awami League party was barred from taking part. Hasina, 78, who was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced&lt;/a&gt; to death in absentia for crimes against humanity, issued a statement from hiding in India decrying an “illegal and unconstitutional election”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The US embassy congratulated Rahman and the BNP for a “historic victory”, while neighbouring India praised Rahman’s “decisive win”, a notable shift after deeply strained ties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;China and Pakistan, which both grew closer to Bangladesh since the 2024 uprising and the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1961852&quot;&gt;souring&lt;/a&gt; of ties with India, where Hasina has sheltered since her ouster, also congratulated the BNP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;International election observers said the polls had been a success, with the European Union saying Saturday they had been “credible”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Republican Institute noted that while “election administration was technically sound, the broader political environment remains fragile”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#successful&quot; id=&quot;successful&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Successful’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat’s Rahman said his party “will serve as a vigilant, principled, and peaceful opposition, holding the government to account”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commissioner Md Anwarul Islam Sarker told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; that the vote had been a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was by far the best election,” he said, noting that voting was cancelled at only one of the more than 42,000 polling centres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“People had doubts about whether a successful election could be held under these circumstances, but we have done it,” he said on Saturday. “If anyone still has any issues, they can go to court.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Election Commission said turnout was 59 percent across 299 constituencies out of 300 in which voting took place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only seven women were elected, although a further 50 seats in parliament reserved for women will be named from party lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafiqur Rahman stressed the significant gains his party had made compared with past elections, after years of being crushed under Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“With 77 seats, we have nearly quadrupled our parliamentary presence and become one of the strongest opposition blocs in modern Bangladeshi politics,” he said. That is not a setback. That is a foundation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters on Thursday also endorsed proposals in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972702&quot;&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; for a sweeping democratic reform charter backed by Yunus, to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those include prime ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crisis Group analyst Thomas Kean warned that the incoming government now faced “daunting challenges”, including “boosting the economy, ensuring security and continuing the reform process”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#history-that-has-seen-both-challenges-and-cooperation&quot; id=&quot;history-that-has-seen-both-challenges-and-cooperation&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘History that has seen both challenges and cooperation’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) on Saturday said it looked forward to improved ties between Pakistan and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a post on X, the party thanked President Asif Ali Zardari for his “warm congratulations and thoughtful message“.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP noted that while Islamabad and Dhaka share a complex history marked by both challenges and cooperation, “yet our peoples have continued to value dialogue, respect, and regional engagement”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Expressing optimism about the future, the party said it “remained hopeful that the two nations would further strengthen constructive ties, expand economic collaboration, and enhance people-to-people contacts in the years ahead”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It added that “closer cooperation could contribute to a more peaceful and prosperous South Asia.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The verdict is not a triumph of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party alone. It is a collective signal that governance matters more than agitation, and that radical rhetoric does not substitute for administrative competence</description>

      <title>Boycott averted, Pakistan and India set for World Cup blockbuster</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1973175/boycott-averted-pakistan-and-india-set-for-world-cup-blockbuster</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Pakistan and India will clash in the Twenty20 World Cup in Colombo on Sunday, still feeling the aftershocks of a tumultuous fortnight in which Pakistan’s boycott threat - &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;later reversed&lt;/a&gt; - nearly blew a hole in the tournament’s marquee fixture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With bilateral cricket a casualty of their fraught relations, emotions run high whenever the bitter neighbours lock horns in multi-team events at neutral venues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968211&quot;&gt;strained relations &lt;/a&gt;with another neighbour, Bangladesh, have further tangled the geopolitics around the World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Bangladesh were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;replaced&lt;/a&gt; by Scotland in the 20-team field for refusing to tour India over safety concerns, the regional chessboard shifted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan decided to&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt; boycott &lt;/a&gt;the Group A contest against India in solidarity with Bangladesh, jeopardising a lucrative fixture that sits at the intersection of sport, commerce, and geopolitics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faced with the prospect of losing millions of dollars in evaporating advertising revenue, the broadcasters panicked. The governing International Cricket Council (ICC) held hectic behind-the-scenes parleys and eventually brokered a compromise to salvage the tournament’s most sought-after contest.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strictly on cricketing merit, however, the rivalry has been one-sided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defending champions India have a 7-1 record against Pakistan in the tournament’s history and they underlined that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1942082&quot;&gt;dominance&lt;/a&gt; at last year’s Asia Cup in the United Arab Emirates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India beat Pakistan three times in that single event, including a stormy final marred by provocative gestures and snubbed handshakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former India captain Rohit Sharma does not believe in the “favourites” tag, especially when the arch-rivals clash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s such a funny game,” Rohit, who led India to the title in the T20 World Cup two years ago, recently said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You can’t just go and think that it’s a two-point victory for us. You just have to play good cricket on that particular day to achieve those points.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#indias-edge&quot; id=&quot;indias-edge&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;India’s edge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both teams have opened their World Cup campaigns with back-to-back wins, yet India still appears to hold a clear edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opener Abhishek Sharma and spinner Varun Chakravarthy currently top the batting and bowling rankings, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abhishek is doubtful for the Pakistan match, though, as he continues to recover from a stomach infection that kept him out of their first two matches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ishan Kishan has reinvented himself as a top-order linchpin, skipper Suryakumar Yadav has regained form, while Rinku Singh has settled into the finisher’s role in India’s explosive lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mystery spinner Chakravarthy and the ever-crafty Jasprit Bumrah anchor the spin and pace units, while Hardik Pandya’s all-round spark is pivotal.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Pakistan, opener Sahibzada Farhan has looked in fine form, but Babar Azam’s strike rate continues to polarise opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Captain Salman Agha will bank on spin-bowling all-rounder Saim Ayub, but the potential trump card is off-spinner Usman Tariq, whose slinging, side-arm action has intrigued opponents and fans alike.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Rahul Gandhi slammed the India-US trade deal, calling PM Modi &apos;Narendra Surrender Modi&apos; and warning of harm to cotton farmers and textile exporters. He alleged a trap where India faces an 18% tariff on garments while Bangladesh gets 0% by importing US cotton, potentially hurting Indian farmers. Minister Piyush Goyal refuted these claims, stating farmers&apos; interests are protected.</description>

      <description>In Bangladesh’s big election, the BNP scores a major win against the Islamist Jamaat in coalition NCP Gen Z party that ousted Sheikh Hasina. Muhammad Yunus delivers on his promise of elections, but without the Awami League, can the results from Bangladesh’s poll be politically sustainable? And what does it mean for India? We will get you ground reports from The Hindu’s Kallol Bhattacherjee in Dhaka.</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s BNP wins sweeping election majority, promises stability</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890/bangladeshs-bnp-wins-sweeping-election-majority-promises-stability</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won an overwhelming two-thirds majority on Friday in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693&quot;&gt;general elections&lt;/a&gt;, a result expected to bring stability after months of tumult following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;ouster&lt;/a&gt; of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951527&quot;&gt;Gen Z-led uprising&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Latest counts in a vote seen as the South Asian nation’s first truly competitive election in years gave the BNP and its allies at least 212 of the 299 seats up for grabs, domestic TV channels said.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  &quot;&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;People look at the results published by Election Commission, following the 13th general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 13, 2026. &amp;mdash; Reuters&quot; src=&quot;https://i.dawn.com/primary/2026/02/13100720472f896.webp&quot; /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;People look at the results published by Election Commission, following the 13th general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 13, 2026. — Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposition Jamaat-i-Islami and its allies won 70 seats in the Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Election Commission put the BNP at 181 seats, the Jamaat-i-Islami at 61 and others at 7, with full official results not expected before noon (11am PKT) on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP, which returns to power after 20 years, thanked the people soon and called for special prayers on Friday for the nation and its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite winning … by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,” the party said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Citizen Party (NCP), led by youth activists who played a key role in toppling Hasina and was a part of the Jamaat-led alliance, won just five of the 30 seats it contested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clear outcome had been seen as key for stability in the Muslim-majority nation of 175 million after months of deadly anti-Hasina &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1847298&quot;&gt;unrest&lt;/a&gt; disrupted everyday life and industries such as garments, in the export of which Bangladesh is No.2 globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A strong majority gives BNP the parliamentary strength to pass reforms efficiently and avoid legislative paralysis. That alone can create short-term political stability,” Selim Raihan, an economics professor at the University of Dhaka, told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; is widely expected to be sworn in as prime minister. The son of the party’s founder, former president Ziaur Rahman, he &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1963162&quot;&gt;returned&lt;/a&gt; in December to the capital, Dhaka, from 18 years abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In its manifesto, the BNP promised to prioritise job creation, protect low-income and marginal households and ensure fair prices to farmers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If the factories run regularly and we get our wages on time, thats what matters to us. I just want the BNP government to bring back stability so more orders come to Bangladesh and we can survive,” Josna Begum, 28, a garment worker and mother of two, told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; after the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Islamist Jamaat-i-Islami conceded defeat late on Thursday night once trends became clear, but said in a statement on Friday that it was “not satisfied” with the process and asked its followers to stay patient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1880581&quot;&gt;exile&lt;/a&gt; in New Delhi, Hasina long dominated Bangladesh politics along with Rahman’s mother, Khaleda Zia, while his father was a leading independence figure who ruled from 1977 to 1981 before he was assassinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP win with more than 200 seats is one of its biggest, surpassing its 2001 victory with 193, although Hasina’s Awami League, which ruled for 15 years and was barred from contesting this time, secured a bigger tally of 230 in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But elections of other years were boycotted by one of the main parties or were contentious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overnight, throngs of supporters cheered and shouted slogans at the BNP headquarters in Dhaka as the scale of the party’s landslide became clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turnout exceeded the 42 per cent of the last election in 2024, with media nearly 60pc of registered voters participated in the election on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 2,000 candidates, many independents among them, were on the ballot, which featured a record number of at least 50 parties. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadcaster &lt;em&gt;Jamuna TV&lt;/em&gt; said more than 2 million voters chose “Yes”, while more than 850,000 said “No” in a referendum on constitutional reforms held alongside the election, but there was no official word on the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The changes include two-term limits for prime ministers and stronger judicial independence and women’s representation while providing for neutral interim governments during election periods, and setting up a second house of the 300-seat parliament.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday extended their felicitations to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its leader, Rahman, on securing a landslide majority in the national elections and receiving the mandate to form the next government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Presidency, the president congratulated the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the polls across 299 seats with the participation of over 127 million registered voters.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaffirming Pakistan’s support for the sovereignty and democratic aspirations of Bangladesh, the president said Pakistan looks forward to working with the new government to strengthen cooperation in trade, defence, cultural exchanges, and regional forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Zardari said the elections in Bangladesh mark an opportunity for South Asia to move beyond past phases in which regional cooperation, including within SAARC, was held hostage by India, which continues to paralyse the great forum that was born in Bangladesh in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed the hope that the new political environment in Dhaka would contribute to more balanced, independent, and mutually respectful engagement across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president conveyed his best wishes for the continued stability, progress, and prosperity of Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a separate message on X, said: “I extend my warmest felicitations to Mr Tarique Rahman on leading the BNP to a resounding victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. I also congratulate the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the elections.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier said he looked forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership further to strengthen our historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations and advance our shared goals of peace, stability, and development in South Asia and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a later post, he said he held a phone call with Rahman following the BNP’s “historic and resounding victory in the general elections”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Pakistan looks forward to strengthening its brotherly ties with Bangladesh, building on the legacy of Begum Khaleda Zia, and advancing our  shared goals of peace, progress and prosperity,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also congratulated the BNP leader on his victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am confident that, under your able stewardship, Bangladesh will continue its journey towards peace, progress, and prosperity,” he said in a post on X, congratulating the people of Bangladesh on a successful democratic transition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Voting was largely peaceful in an election seen as a test of Bangladesh’s democracy after years of political turmoil &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist party, led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/12/tarique-rahman-bnp-bangladesh-election&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, has won a sweeping victory in the country’s first election since a gen Z uprising toppled the autocratic regime of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/sheikh-hasina&quot;&gt;Sheikh Hasina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results from the election commission confirmed the BNP alliance had won 212 seats, returning the party to power after 20 years, while the rival alliance, led by the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, won 77 seats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/feb/13/bangladesh-election-bnp-wins&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>T20 World Cup: India and Pakistan fans flock to Colombo, windfall for tourism</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972941/t20-world-cup-india-and-pakistan-fans-flock-to-colombo-windfall-for-tourism</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Prices of flights and hotel bookings to Colombo, Sri Lanka, have soared as thousands of fans flock to the city to watch India play Pakistan on Sunday in cricket’s Twenty20 World Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The neighbouring countries and cricket rivals are due to meet during the group stage of the tournament, which is being co-hosted by India and Sri Lanka, after Pakistan &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;reversed &lt;/a&gt;a decision to boycott the match earlier in the week.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game at Sri Lanka’s largest stadium is sold out with roughly 35,000 tickets sold, and ahead of the match, most hotels in Colombo have doubled their prices — the cost of a room has climbed as high as $660 a night from a typical price tag of about $100-$150 per night, multiple booking sites showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the match was finalised this week, last-minute bookings led to fuller flights from major cities like Chennai and Delhi, according to three Colombo travel agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flights from Chennai, which is about one and a half hours away, have more than tripled to around $623-$756, while flights from Delhi are up more than 50 per cent to roughly $666.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nalin Jayasundera, President of Sri Lanka Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO), said hotels were booked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Most fans are coming on all-inclusive packages that could be $1,500-$2000 or even higher depending on ticket, hotel, and flight prices,” Jayasundera said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tourism is the third largest foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka, famous for its ancient temples, pristine beaches, and lush tea plantations.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hoped that hosting more sporting events could boost Sri Lanka’s economic growth, which is recovering from a severe financial crisis and a recent cyclone, which killed 650 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buddhika Hewawasam, chairman of the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that in the first 10 days of February, roughly 20pc of the 100,000 visitors to Sri Lanka were there for the India-Pakistan cricket match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The island nation is hoping to position itself as a neutral venue for matches between political rivals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This is clearly showing confidence in Sri Lanka as a neutral cricket venue. Whether it’s India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, this is a welcome message to all South Asian countries that they can play cricket in Sri Lanka,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lahore local Mian Sultan is looking forward to his trip to Sri Lanka to watch the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think it’s going to be a great experience, said Sultan, who spent $800 on a front-row seat to watch the game alongside a friend who is flying in from New Zealand. I’m really excited about this match.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sultan added he thought Pakistan absolutely could come out on top on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) announced it will formally demand former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina’s extradition from India. The move matters because Hasina faces a death sentence for crimes against humanity. This action directly affects Hasina, India, and Bangladesh’s political and legal landscape.

&lt;p&gt;The decisive mandate secured by the Bangladesh Nationalist Party in the country’s 13th parliamentary election marks an inflection point for a nation emerging from institutional exhaustion. After years of concentrated authority under Sheikh Hasina and the Awami League, Bangladesh confronts the dual challenge of restoring democratic credibility and repairing economic drift.

                  &lt;div class=&quot;field field-body clearfix&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has decisively won parliamentary elections in Bangladesh, in what was considered the first free and fair national vote in nearly two decades.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BNP won at least 212 of the 299 seats, the election commission said on Friday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A coalition of opposition parties led by Jamaat-e-Islami won 77 seats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The victory of the BNP means its leader Tarique Rahman is poised to follow in the footsteps of both his parents and lead Bangladesh.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahman is the son of Khaleda Zia, the former prime minister, and Ziaur Rahman, the assassinated former president.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;Despite winning... by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised,&quot; the BNP said on Friday, asking voters to offer prayers instead.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh has been in a period of turbulence since Sheikh Hasina, the former longtime prime minister, was removed following a student-led uprising in August 2024. She is currently in exile in India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, the country has been governed by an interim administration led by Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Peace laureate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hasina&apos;s second stint in office from 2009 until her ouster in 2024 was marred by arrests of political opponents, the silencing of dissenting voices and accusations of human rights abuses.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In November, a court sentenced her to death in absentia over crimes against humanity when ordering a deadly crackdown on student-led protesters. Hasina&apos;s Awami League was banned from the election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jamaat, which formed an alliance that included youth activists in the National Citizen Party, had been expected to do well but ultimately fell short.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It conceded defeat, though said on Friday that it was &quot;not satisfied&quot; with the process of vote counting in some constituencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its defeat, it still marks Jamaat&apos;s highest ever tally of seats in parliament, 70, and the first time it has contested elections since being banned by Hasina in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;India and Pakistan congratulate BNP&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rahman is set to become the first male non-interim prime minister of Bangladesh in over 35 years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He returned to Bangladesh in December after 17 years of exile spent in London.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;block-adsense block-adsense-managed-ad-block&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;adsense responsive&quot;&gt;
    
&lt;!-- responsive --&gt;
&lt;ins class=&quot;adsbygoogle mee-auto-ad-wrapper &quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;/ins&gt;

  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His party has campaigned on job creation, protection for low-income households and securing fair prices for farmers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some voters, Rahman was seen as a continuation of the dynastic politics which has dominated Bangladesh since it became an independent country in 1971.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India, Pakistan and the US congratulated the BNP on its victory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ties between India and Bangladesh, traditionally close allies, have soured in recent months, particularly over New Delhi&apos;s refusal to extradite Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turnout for the election was reported as just under 60 percent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alongside parliamentary elections, a referendum on constitutional reforms championed by interim leader Yunus was also held.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reforms included introducing two-term limits for prime ministers, stronger judicial independence and female representation, providing neutral interim governments during election periods as well as setting up a new second chamber.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was no official outcome on the referendum by Friday afternoon, though media reported that early indications suggest it would pass comfortably by over 65 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reforms were designed to prevent autocratic leaders and governments seizing power in future.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladesh’s general election brings the BNP to power, signaling political stability, with Tarique Rahman set to become prime minister. The outcome could boost investor confidence. However, the country must diversify its economy beyond garment exports, a critical step as Bangladesh prepares to graduate from least developed country status. Ongoing reforms aim to strengthen governance and support sustainable economic growth.</description>

      <title>In pictures: Bangladesh a day after polls — BNP poised to form government</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972909/in-pictures-bangladesh-a-day-after-polls-bnp-poised-to-form-government</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) claimed a thumping win on Friday in the first elections held since a deadly 2024 uprising, with leader Tarique Rahman &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;poised&lt;/a&gt; to become prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But final official results are yet to come and BNP’s main rival Jamaat-i-Islami — leading a wider coalition — said it had “serious questions about the integrity of the results process”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Jamuna&lt;/em&gt; television channel projected that the BNP had secured 212 seats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It said Jamaat had won 74, a huge leap from its past results but far short of the outright win it had campaigned for. &lt;em&gt;Somoy&lt;/em&gt; TV broadcast similar figures.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>What are the key priorities of the BNP, winner of the Bangladesh election?</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972906/what-are-the-key-priorities-of-the-bnp-winner-of-the-bangladesh-election</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh National Party (BNP)&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890/bangladeshs-bnp-wins-big-in-historic-parliamentary-election&quot;&gt; won&lt;/a&gt; a decisive two-thirds majority on Friday in general elections, a result expected to bring stability to the nation after months of tumult following the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-led uprising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party, led by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, will return to power after 20 years. Rahman, the son of BNP founder and former president Ziaur Rahman, is widely expected to be sworn in as prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the key promises made by the BNP in its election manifesto, which has the motto ‘Bangladesh before all’:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#reforms&quot; id=&quot;reforms&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Reforms&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party aims to implement all points of the July Charter, which sought to create new constitutional bodies, introduce a bicameral parliament, along with broader changes in line with political parties’ commitments.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the key promises made includes undertaking initiatives to restart closed industries and diversify the export sector. The party has also vowed to undertake measures so that legally operating foreign businesses can repatriate their stipulated profits to their home countries within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#employment&quot; id=&quot;employment&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Employment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On employment, the BNP has promised to create nearly 1 million new jobs in the information and communication technology sector. They have also promised to ensure fair, price-index-based wages in line with inflation and a review system to be launched every two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party has said that it will develop technical and language skills among the youth and ensure merit-based government recruitment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BNP has promised to introduce international payment systems, establish regional e-commerce hubs and boost ‘Make in Bangladesh’. Another key priority includes the launch of a ‘Family Card’ for low-income families with monthly provisions to buy essential commodities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#health&quot; id=&quot;health&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Health&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On health, the party said it will increase public spending on health to 5 per cent of GDP gradually and promised to recruit 100,000 health workers across the country and expand preventive healthcare programmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#social&quot; id=&quot;social&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Social&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP has promised to launch a mid-day meal program for students and a new skills and values-based education policy for schools. The party also pledged to build better sports infrastructure and training facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, it plans to set up training-based welfare programs for religious leaders of all faiths at places of worship.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;DHAKA, Feb 13 - The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won an overwhelming two-thirds majority on Friday in general elections, a result expected to bring stability after months of tumult following the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in a Gen Z-led uprising in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh’s BNP wins big in historic parliamentary election</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972890/bangladeshs-bnp-wins-big-in-historic-parliamentary-election</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) won a landslide parliamentary election on Friday, local TV stations showed, securing a resounding mandate in a pivotal vote that is expected to restore political stability in the South Asian nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parliamentary &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693&quot;&gt;election&lt;/a&gt; held on Thursday was Bangladesh’s first vote since the 2024 Gen Z-driven uprising that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;toppled long-time premier&lt;/a&gt; Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A clear outcome had been seen as crucial for stability in the Muslim-majority country of 175 million after months of deadly anti-Hasina unrest disrupted everyday life and hit major industries, including the apparel sector in the world’s second-largest garment exporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was also the first national election to follow recent revolts led by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951527&quot;&gt;under-30s&lt;/a&gt; that have cropped up through the wider region. Nepal is set to hold a vote next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#bnp-sails-to-victory&quot; id=&quot;bnp-sails-to-victory&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;BNP sails to victory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls had given BNP an edge and the party lived up to the forecasts, with the coalition it dominates winning 209 seats to secure an overwhelming two-thirds majority in the 300-member Jatiya Sangsad, or House of the Nation, Jamuna TV showed.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  sm:w-full  media--left  &quot;&gt;

        &lt;figcaption class=&quot;media__caption  &quot;&gt;People look at the results published by Election Commission, following the 13th general election, in Dhaka, Bangladesh on February 13, 2026. — Reuters&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon after it won a majority in the overnight vote-count, the party thanked and congratulated the people and called for special prayers on Friday for the welfare of the country and its people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Despite winning the national parliamentary election by a large margin of votes, no celebratory procession or rally shall be organised by BNP,” the party said in a statement and urged people to pray at mosques, temples, churches and pagodas across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP is led by top prime ministerial contender &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, the 60-year-old son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and former President Ziaur Rahman.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its campaign promises included financial aid for poor families, a 10-year limit for an individual to remain prime minister, boosting the economy by measures including foreign investments, and anti-corruption policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#jamaat-promises-positive-opposition&quot; id=&quot;jamaat-promises-positive-opposition&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Jamaat promises positive opposition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shafiqur Rahman, the head of BNP’s main rival, the Jamaat-i-Islami, conceded defeat, with his party-led alliance winning on just 68 seats. Rahman said Jamaat would not engage in the “politics of opposition” for the sake of it. “We will do positive politics,” he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Citizen Party (NCP), led by youth activists who were instrumental in toppling Hasina and was a part of the Jamaat-led alliance, won just five of the 30 seats it contested.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the landslide result, the election had been seen as Bangladesh’s first truly competitive vote in years. Hasina’s Awami League party, which ruled the country for more than 15 years until her ousting, was barred from contesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turnout appeared on track on Thursday to exceed the 42pc recorded in the last election in 2024. Local media reported that more than 60pc of registered voters were expected to have cast ballots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 2,000 candidates — including many independents — were on the ballot, and at least 50 parties contested seats, a national record. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside the election, a referendum was held on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and introducing a two-term limit for the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no official word on the outcome of the referendum. Leading local newspaper, the &lt;em&gt;Daily Star,&lt;/em&gt; reported that 73pc of the nearly 296,000 votes cast in the referendum said ‘Yes’ and the rest said ‘No’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#hasina-calls-vote-a-farce&quot; id=&quot;hasina-calls-vote-a-farce&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Hasina calls vote a farce&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina is in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, which has frayed ties between Dhaka and New Delhi and opened the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement sent after polling stations closed, Hasina denounced the election as a “carefully planned farce”, held without her party and without real voter participation. She said Awami League supporters had rejected the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We demand the cancellation of this voterless, illegal and unconstitutional election … the removal of the suspension imposed on the activities of the Awami League, and the restoration of the people’s voting rights through the arrangement of a free, fair, and inclusive election under a neutral caretaker government,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opponents of Hasina say that elections under her rule were frequently marred by boycotts and intimidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday extended their felicitations to the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its leader, Tarique Rahman, on securing a landslide majority in the national elections and receiving the mandate to form the next government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the Presidency, the president congratulated the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the polls across 299 seats with the participation of over 127 million registered voters.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reaffirming Pakistan’s support for the sovereignty and democratic aspirations of Bangladesh, the president said Pakistan looks forward to working with the new government to strengthen cooperation in trade, defence, cultural exchanges, and regional forums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Zardari said the elections in Bangladesh mark an opportunity for South Asia to move beyond past phases in which regional cooperation, including within SAARC, was held hostage by India, which continues to paralyse the great forum that was born in Bangladesh in 1985.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed the hope that the new political environment in Dhaka would contribute to more balanced, independent, and mutually respectful engagement across the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president conveyed his best wishes for the continued stability, progress, and prosperity of Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a separate message on X, said: “I extend my warmest felicitations to Mr. Tarique Rahman on leading the BNP to a resounding victory in the Parliamentary elections in Bangladesh. I also congratulate the people of Bangladesh on the successful conduct of the elections.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The premier said he looked forward to working closely with the new Bangladesh leadership further to strengthen our historic, brotherly, multifaceted bilateral relations and advance our shared goals of peace, stability, and development in South Asia and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also congratulated the BNP leader on his victory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am confident that, under your able stewardship, Bangladesh will continue its journey towards peace, progress, and prosperity,” he said in a post on X, congratulating the people of Bangladesh on a successful democratic transition.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>‘Invisible’ children born in the brothels of Bangladesh finally get birth certificates</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Destined to a perilous life with no right to an education or to vote, state recognition ‘gives them hope’, campaigners say&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through the decades that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/17/children-trapped-bangladesh-brothel-village-video?CMP=share_btn_tw&quot;&gt;the Daulatdia brothel&lt;/a&gt; in Bangladesh has existed, children born there have been invisible, unable to be registered because their mothers were sex workers and their fathers unknown. Now, for the first time, all 400 of them in the brothel village have their own birth certificates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That milestone was reached after a push by campaigners who have spent decades working with Bangladesh’s undocumented children born in brothels or on the street. It means they can finally access the rights afforded to other citizens: the ability to go to school, to be issued a passport or to vote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2026/feb/13/invisible-children-born-in-the-brothels-of-bangladesh-finally-get-birth-certificates&quot;&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A new Bangladesh?</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972865/a-new-bangladesh</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;EIGHTEEN months on from the momentous mass protests which upended political life in Bangladesh, the long-awaited general election has finally come to pass, ushering in what many are celebrating as a new era of popular sovereignty. Beyond surface appearances, however, there is a distinct sense that old wine is being repackaged in new bottles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jamaat-i-Islami and Bangladesh National Party (BNP) will be the two biggest parties in parliament. The latter’s leader, Tarique Rahman, son of military dictator Gen Ziaur Rahman, is set to become prime minister; his mother, the late Khaleda Zia was PM twice in the 1990s and early 2000s. The JI, meanwhile, has literally come back from the dead following the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dawn.com/news/1257512&quot;&gt;execution&lt;/a&gt; of its main leaders in the mid-2010s for their opposition to Bangladesh’s independence movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only genuinely ‘new’ actor in Bangladesh’s latest chapter, the organic student leadership which spearheaded the movement to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;oust&lt;/a&gt; ex-PM Sheikh Hasina and her Awami League (AL) party, is represented to an extent by the recently formed National Citizen Party, which chose to ally with the JI in the lead-up to the poll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election day was notable for the fact that voters cast two separate ballots — one to elect members of parliament and the second as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972702&quot;&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; to introduce sweeping constitutional amendments. Bangladesh has held three referendums before this one — two were shambolic and designed to rubber-stamp military dictatorships. The present one has followed the banning of the AL under a dubious anti-terrorism law. It remains to be seen whether Bangladesh’s version of constitutional reform resembles the 26th and 27th &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1953888&quot;&gt;amendment&lt;/a&gt; abominations in this country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;blockquote-level-1&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most voters have been swayed by rhetoric around ‘corruption’.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh is, like Pakistan, an extremely young country. At least half of its 120 million voters have never voted before. The student-led movement to depose the Hasina regime was a coming-of-age moment for many young people. The further exercise of their political agency through the vote is no small matter. Yet most of the voting public has been swayed by rhetoric around ‘corruption’, that age-old empty signifier. Neither the interim government nor the three main political parties that contested seemed interested in naming, let alone addressing, deeper structural challenges like the limits of the cheap labour-centric export-oriented capitalist growth model and the powers of military, civil and judicial bureaucracies.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the other end of the subcontinent, the establishment and mainstream intelligentsia celebrated recent events in Bangladesh, gleefully watching the India-friendly AL’s demise and the resuscitation of right-wing forces that have a much greater ideological synergy with the usual suspects here. It should be noted, for instance, that the BNP and JI fielded &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970536&quot;&gt;very few&lt;/a&gt; women candidates. Pakistan’s own embattled progressive forces can hardly be thrilled about Bangladesh’s current direction. The re-emergence of the JI in particular inevitably throws up memories of 1971, an event that many here continue to see only through the prism of Indian designs; the aspirations of the Bengali masses remain absent from the narrative. Indeed, the fact that the mainstream here continues to reduce the situation in Balochistan to a rendering of the proverbial foreign hand shows that few lessons have been learned from 1971.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Pakistan’s exceedingly you­ng population also craves a break from the security-centric system. But youth aspirations for change have repeatedly been suffocated by manipulation of poll man-dates and/or outri­ght re-pression. We have learned that getting rid of inc­u­mbents and bringing in ‘new’ faces can reinforce the under­-lying struct­ure of power rather than displacing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1894685&quot;&gt;you­th&lt;/a&gt;, who in August 2024 proved that revolutionary imaginaries can still motivate a collective politics of the people, will have their work cut out to hold the new elected government to account, both with regard to the economic needs of young working people and the preservation of democratic freedoms. Yet it is true that the current political clime in Bangla­desh feels more open and hopeful than the gloom engulfing young people here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This despondency is not just due to state authoritarianism or the complicity of the PML-N and PPP. The differences between the two countries, and the organised power of young people in particular, are explained in part by the fact that student unions are alive and well in Bangladesh. This foundational democratic institution has been conspicuous by its absence in this country for 42 years now, the ban enforced by Gen Ziaul Haq’s dictatorial regime in February 1984 still being in force. We need such nurseries of democracy to seed organised political forces that can genuinely challenge power wielders and their lackeys.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>T20 World Cup: India tune-up for Pakistan showdown with 93-run rout of Namibia</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972737/t20-world-cup-india-tune-up-for-pakistan-showdown-with-93-run-rout-of-namibia</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;India tuned up for their &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;blockbuster showdown&lt;/a&gt; with Pakistan at the Men’s T20 World Cup with a 93-run hammering of Namibia at New Delhi’s Arun Jaitley Stadium on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the high-octane game against their arch-rivals looming in Colombo on Sunday, Ishan Kishan got in the mood with 61 off just 24 balls to push India to 209-9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Namibia, who won the toss and chose to field, were bowled out for 116 as India matched Pakistan in making it two wins out of two in Group A.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spinner Varun Chakravarthy put the squeeze on Namibia, who started their innings brightly, with 3-7 from two overs as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1842745&quot;&gt;defending champions &lt;/a&gt;India made it 10 wins in a row in T20 World Cups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chakravarthy struck with his first ball to remove Louren Steenkamp for 29 and took two more wickets in his second over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fellow spinner Axar Patel took two wickets with his left-arm spin, including Malan Kruger, for five, when Jasprit Bumrah took a high, diving catch at short fine-leg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hardik Pandya took two wickets in two balls near the end, but the hat-trick was averted before the innings folded in 18.2 overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For India, Sanju Samson struck 22 in eight balls and Kishan smacked left-arm pace bowler JJ Smit for four sixes and a four to raise his fifty off 20 balls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India raced to 100 in the seventh over before off-spinner Gerhard Erasmus dismissed Kishan with the first ball of his spell before finishing with 4-20 from his four overs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India had a mini-collapse from 104-1 to 124-4, before Pandya, who hit 52, and Shivam Dube, who made 23, rebuilt the innings with a stand of 81 for the fifth wicket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandya fell to Erasmus with substitute fielder Dylan Leicher taking a stunning grab in the deep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He caught the ball on the run but flipped the ball up inside the playing area as he stepped over the ropes, before crossing back to complete the catch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pakistan government late on Tuesday reversed its order for the cricket team to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970468&quot;&gt;boycott &lt;/a&gt;Sunday’s match as a protest at Bangladesh being &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968934&quot;&gt;kicked out &lt;/a&gt;of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;India top the group from Pakistan on net run rate, and the winner of Sunday’s clash will be assured of advancing to the Super Eight stage as one of the top two in the five-team group.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Early counts show BNP ahead in Bangladesh election after strong turnout</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/early-counts-show-bnp-ahead-in-bangladesh-election-after-strong-turnout</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party raced ahead of its rival Jamaat-i-Islami on Thursday, early counting showed, after tens of millions of Bangladeshis voted in a pivotal national election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first vote since the 2024 Gen Z-driven uprising that toppled long-time premier Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts say a clear outcome is crucial for stability in the nation of 175 million, after months of deadly anti-Hasina protests disrupted everyday life and hit major industries, including the garment sector, the world’s second-largest exporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first national election to follow the recent under-30, Gen Z-led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1940849/calls-for-restraint-as-nepali-pm-disappears-after-stepping-down&quot;&gt;uprisings &lt;/a&gt;scattered around the world, with Nepal set to hold a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1948843&quot;&gt;vote &lt;/a&gt;next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting began at 4:30pm (3:30pm PKT) at most booths, immediately after polls closed, with clear trends expected around midnight and results likely to be clear by Friday morning, election commission officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race pits two coalitions led by former allies, BNP and Jamaat, with opinion polls giving the BNP a slight edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP was leading in 50 seats and Jamaat in 18, local TV news stations said. Bangladesh’s parliament, the Jatiya Sangsad, has 300 seats, with 151 required for a simple majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The party declared on its official Facebook page that its chief and prime ministerial candidate Tarique Rahman had won one of two seats he contested. Election authorities were yet to announce the result officially, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP members clapped and cheered loudly as they celebrated outside the party office in Dhaka on hearing the news of his victory, visuals on the Facebook page showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turnout appeared on track to exceed the 42 per cent recorded in the last election in 2024. Local media reported that more than 60pc of registered voters were expected to have cast ballots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hasina’s Awami League is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951958/bangladeshs-sheikh-hasina-warns-of-mass-voter-boycott-as-her-party-barred-from-election&quot;&gt;banned&lt;/a&gt;, and she remains in self-imposed exile in long-term ally India, opening the window for China to expand its influence in Bangladesh as Dhaka’s ties with New Delhi fray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elections under Hasina were frequently marred by boycotts and intimidation, critics say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a statement sent to journalists on WhatsApp, Hasina denounced the election as a “carefully planned farce”, held without her party and without real voter participation. She said Awami League supporters had rejected the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We demand the cancellation of this voterless, illegal, and unconstitutional election … the removal of the suspension imposed on the activities of the Awami League; and the restoration of the people’s voting rights through the arrangement of a free, fair, and inclusive election under a neutral caretaker government,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside the election, a referendum was held on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and a two-term limit for the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, were on the ballot and at least 50 parties contested — a national record. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were no reports of major violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many voters echoed that sentiment, telling &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the atmosphere felt freer and more festive than in previous elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamal Chowdhury, 31, who works as a driver for a company in Dhaka and travelled to his hometown in the eastern district of Brahmanbaria to cast his vote, said: “It feels festive here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside a polling booth in Dhaka, where BNP chief Rahman and head of the interim government Muhammad Yunus voted, policemen were on horses with saddle blankets proclaiming: “Police are here, vote without fear.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Jamaat-i-Islami were locked in a tight race on Thursday, early counting showed, after tens of millions of Bangladeshis voted in a pivotal national election — the first since the 2024 Gen Z-driven &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;uprising &lt;/a&gt;that toppled long-time premier Sheikh Hasina.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysts say a clear outcome is crucial for stability in the nation of 175 million, after months of deadly anti-Hasina protests disrupted everyday life and hit major industries, including the garment sector, the world’s second-largest exporter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was the first national election to follow the recent under-30, Gen Z-led &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1940849/calls-for-restraint-as-nepali-pm-disappears-after-stepping-down&quot;&gt;uprisings &lt;/a&gt;scattered around the world, with Nepal set to hold a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1948843&quot;&gt;vote &lt;/a&gt;next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting began at 4:30pm (3:30pm PKT) at most booths, immediately after polls closed, with clear trends expected around midnight and results likely to be clear by Friday morning, election commission officials said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The race pits two coalitions led by former allies, the BNP and Jamaat, with opinion polls giving the BNP a slight edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP was leading in 10 seats and Jamaat in seven of the nearly 20 seats for which early trends were available, local TV news stations said. Bangladesh’s parliament, the Jatiya Sangsad, has 300 seats, with 151 required for a simple majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turnout appeared on track to exceed the 42 per cent recorded in the last election in 2024. Local media reported that more than 60pc of registered voters were expected to have cast ballots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both prime ministerial candidates — the BNP’s Tarique Rahman and Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman said they were confident of winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The two men are not related.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am confident of winning the election. There is enthusiasm among the people about the vote,” Tarique Rahman told reporters, while the Jamaat’s Shafiqur Rahman called the election a “turning point” for Bangladesh and said the people were eager for change.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside the election, a referendum was held on a set of constitutional reforms, including establishing a neutral interim government for election periods, restructuring parliament into a bicameral legislature, increasing women’s representation, strengthening judicial independence and a two-term limit for the prime minister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 2,000 candidates, including many independents, were on the ballot and at least 50 parties contested — a national record. Voting in one constituency was postponed after a candidate died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were no reports of major violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many voters echoed that sentiment, telling &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the atmosphere felt freer and more festive than in previous elections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kamal Chowdhury, 31, who works as a driver for a company in Dhaka and travelled to his hometown in the eastern district of Brahmanbaria to cast his vote, said: “It feels festive here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside a polling booth in Dhaka, where BNP chief Rahman and head of the interim government Muhammad Yunus voted, policemen were on horses with saddle blankets proclaiming: “Police are here, vote without fear.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>DHAKA — Polling for Bangladesh’s 13th national parliamentary elections has concluded, and vote counting has begun across the country. The elections follow an 18-month student-led movement that ended Sheikh Hasina’s two-decade rule. The results will determine control of the 300 directly elected seats in the Jatiya Sangsad. Tough competition is expected between alliances led by [&amp;#8230;]</description>

      <title>Counting under way in landmark Bangladesh elections after Gen Z revolution</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/counting-under-way-in-landmark-bangladesh-elections-after-gen-z-revolution</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Counting was under way on Thursday in Bangladesh’s first election since a deadly 2024 uprising and the subsequent student-led revolution, with powerful political heir &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; bullish about defeating a coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 60-year-old said he was “confident” his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) — which was crushed during the 15 years of ousted premier Sheikh Hasina’s autocratic rule — can regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, he faces a stiff challenge from a coalition led by Jamaat-i-Islami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commission officials reported “a few minor disruptions” but top party leaders on both sides raised fears of threats, with the BNP’s Rahman calling on people to vote so that “conspiracies will not succeed”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign, hoping to form the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat, which has campaigned on a platform of justice and ending corruption, senses its biggest opportunity in decades, with party leader Shafiqur saying it “will do whatever is required” to ensure a fair result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The early results indicate something positive”, the Jamaat chief said, as counting continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BNP’s Tarique has said he is “confident” of victory, and his adviser said the party would “secure a sweeping victory”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many opinion polls give the BNP the lead, although some suggest a knife-edge race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polls closed at 4:30pm (3:30 PKT), with the first significant results potentially expected overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#polling&quot; id=&quot;polling&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Polling&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, voters lined up outside polling stations in Dhaka in the hugely anticipated election, while key party leaders raised fears of threats or “conspiracies” to derail the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But “if people in Bangladesh come out to cast their votes, conspiracies will not succeed”, Tarique said after voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With around 128m people eligible to vote, turnout reached a high 32.88 per cent by noon at about three-fourths of the 42,651 polling centres across the country, Akhtar Ahmed, senior secretary of the Election Commission, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no reports of major violence, but a BNP leader died in a scuffle outside a polling booth in the coastal town of Khulna, and two paramilitary personnel and a 13-year old girl were injured when a home-made bomb exploded outside a polling booth in Hasina’s stronghold of Gopalganj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country on election day, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was my first vote,” said Shithi Goswami, 21, a student at Dhaka City College. “I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UN experts warned ahead of voting of “growing intolerance, threats and attacks”, and a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972525&quot;&gt;tsunami of disinformation&lt;/a&gt;”, especially targeting millions of young first-time voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls vary widely, though most give the BNP the lead — with some suggesting a knife-edge race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During campaigning, political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600, police records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin said the vote was going “smoothly in a free and fair manner”, with “a few minor disruptions” — noting the main threat was a flood of disinformation on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;Muhammad Yunus&lt;/a&gt;, who will step down once the new government takes power, has said the vote “will determine the future direction of the country”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led the South Asian nation since Hasina’s 15-year rule ended with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;her ouster&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His administration has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951958/bangladeshs-sheikh-hasina-warns-of-mass-voter-boycott-as-her-party-barred-from-election&quot;&gt;barred her&lt;/a&gt; Awami League party from contesting the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, 78, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; in absentia for crimes against humanity for the bloody crackdown on protesters during her final months in power, and remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus, speaking after voting, said that the country had “ended the nightmare and begun a new dream”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#spirit-of-the-uprising&quot; id=&quot;spirit-of-the-uprising&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Spirit of the uprising’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 127m voters were also voting in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972702/why-is-bangladesh-holding-a-national-referendum-alongside-its-general-election&quot;&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; on whether to endorse proposals for prime-ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeasin Arafat Emon, 25, said he had backed the charter as it “reflects the spirit of the uprising”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters will elect 300 lawmakers directly, with a further 50 women chosen from party lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several voters were conflicted about participating in the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some are determined to cast their ballots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. “Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next government will inherit a battered economy in the world’s second-largest garment exporter, as well as delicate relations with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s Tarique — whose late parents both led the country — told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; ahead of the vote that his first priority, if elected, would be restoring security and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he warned the challenges ahead were immense, and that “the economy has been destroyed”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>PM Shehbaz to attend inaugural Board of Peace meeting in US, confirms FO</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972727/pm-shehbaz-to-attend-inaugural-board-of-peace-meeting-in-us-confirms-fo</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Foreign Office (FO) spokesperson Tahir Andrabi confirmed on Thursday that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting in the US, saying that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar would also accompany him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrabi’s confirmation follows &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972442&quot;&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that said PM Shehbaz was expected to visit Washington on February 18 and represent Pakistan at the first meeting of US President Donald Trump’s Board of Peace, which is scheduled for Feb 19 at the US Institute of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can confirm that the prime minister will attend the upcoming Board of Peace meeting. He will be accompanied by the deputy prime minister and foreign minister,” Andrabi said during a weekly briefing of the FO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that information about other members of Pakistan’s delegation and its engagements would be shared in due course of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked specifically whether Chief of Defence Forces and Chief of Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir would be included in the delegation, the FO spokesperson reiterated: “We will share these details in due course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I do not have the details — neither on the itinerary, nor on the composition of the delegation. I can confirm that the prime minister will lead the delegation and that the deputy prime minister and foreign minister will be part of the delegation. This is the extent of information right now. We will, of course, update you in due course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pakistan is among the 14 countries that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1968339&quot;&gt;signed&lt;/a&gt; the charter of the Board of Peace on January 22 on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos, becoming a founding member of the body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The board was initially proposed in September 2025 and formally established last month. Under its charter, the US government serves as its official depository. President Trump has designated the Donald J. Trump Institute of Peace in Washington as the board’s headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A UN Security Council resolution adopted in mid-November 2025 authorised the board, along with cooperating states, to establish an international stabilisation force in Gaza following a ceasefire that began in October under a Trump-backed plan accepted by Israel and Hamas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the ceasefire has remained fragile, with repeated &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1971789&quot;&gt;violations&lt;/a&gt; by Israel.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under Trump’s Gaza plan unveiled late last year, the Board of Peace was originally intended to supervise Gaza’s temporary governance following a ceasefire, before being expanded to address global conflicts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rights experts and scholars have, however,&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1965054&quot;&gt; criticised the concept&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that a US-led board overseeing the affairs of a foreign territory resembles a colonial structure. The absence of Palestinian representation on the board has further deepened these concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A journalist also pointed out during the FO briefing on Thursday that there was no representation from Gaza on the board. Highlighting US support for Israel as well, the journalist asked: “How reliable would this Board of Peace prove to be for the people of Gaza?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his response, Andrabi said, “We have joined the Board of Peace in good faith, as I highlighted in my previous briefing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also pointed that Pakistan had not joined the board in isolation and not as “one voice, but as collective voice of eight Islamic-Arab countries”, which had &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1944220&quot;&gt;worked with Trump&lt;/a&gt; on his Gaza plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our collective voice is resonating in the Board of Peace, and we will continue to strive for the rights, peace and prosperity of the people of Palestine, aimed at the long-term solution of the Palestine issue — to create a state of Palestine, in accordance with the pre-1967 border with Al Quds Al Sharif as its capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So, our engagement is both for short-term, medium-term and long-term solution of the plight of the Palestinian people,” he explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972698/israel-has-joined-trumps-board-of-peace-netanyahu-says&quot;&gt;Israel joining the board&lt;/a&gt;, the FO spokesperson said: “It is their decision. We are not obliged to offer any comment. We will engage with the Board of Peace with positivity of intent, and as I said, our prime minister will attend the Board of Peace meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#shot-down-a-number-of-indian-rafale-jets&quot; id=&quot;shot-down-a-number-of-indian-rafale-jets&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Shot down a number of Indian Rafale jets’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andrabi was also asked for a clarification following Trump’s recent remarks that 10 aircraft were shot down during the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1910509&quot;&gt;four-day conflict&lt;/a&gt; between India and Pakistan in May 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past 10 months, the US president has stated numerous times that aircraft were shot down during the conflict — albeit without specifying whose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially stating that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1925193&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;five jets&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were shot down, Trump gradually raised that number to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951783&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;seven in October&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and then &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1953444&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;eight in November&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to the question on Trump’s statement, the FO spokesperson said: “We have stated it previously, and I wish to reiterate it here that Pakistan is appreciative of the role of the United States during our 90-hour war with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The role of the United States was for peace, for prevention of war and prevention of violence. So, in that context, President Trump’s statements, previous statements, and these statements are all obviously welcomed and endorsed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As regards the fighter planes: this is a matter of history,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said Pakistan shot down “a number of Indian Rafale jets, and the evidence is all over — available internationally, corroborated by international reports, including by the manufacturers of these planes”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This demonstrated that Pakistan was able to deter Indian aggression through conventional means. This is also an indicator for the future — any future Indian aggression would be dealt forthrightly and forcefully with all our resources,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#weaponisation-of-cricket-is-regrettable&quot; id=&quot;weaponisation-of-cricket-is-regrettable&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Weaponisation of cricket is regrettable’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the session, the FO spokesperson was asked whether Pakistan’s decision to play the T20 World Cup match against India after &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972086&quot;&gt;announcing &lt;/a&gt;an initial &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1970421&quot;&gt;boycott &lt;/a&gt;was the consequence of back-channel cricket diplomacy between the two sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Andrabi said: “Cricket is a game that we all love and we all cherish. We grew up playing this game. Weaponisation of cricket, politicisation of cricket is regrettable.”&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven media--tweet&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--twitter  &quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He explained that the government’s decision to not play against India “reflected the resolve of the government of Pakistan to not let cricket be weaponised and politicised”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our subsequent decision to play reflected our magnanimity, after the relevant cricket authorities realised that they had weaponised and politicised cricket, particularly weaponised against Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As you are aware, the Bangladesh side and Sri Lankan side (host of this game) were in touch with our government and cricket board,” he highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“So the decision to play the game, is reflective of the magnanimity shown by our prime minister as a result of contacts made by the brotherly countries of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, as well as by a realisation within the relevant authorities managing cricket internationally and in India, that weaponisation and politicisation of cricket is wrong, is unwarranted, and it defies the spirit of the beloved game of cricket that we all cherish,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Risk of Nipah spread low after cases in India, Bangladesh: WHO</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972723/risk-of-nipah-spread-low-after-cases-in-india-bangladesh-who</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organisation has said the risk of the deadly Nipah virus spreading was low after three cases of infection were recently confirmed in India and Bangladesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nipah, which spreads from animals to humans, has no vaccine and a fatality rate ranging from 40 to 75 per cent, according to the UN health body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the past few weeks, three cases of Nipah — two in India and one in Bangladesh — made headlines and caused concern about a wider outbreak,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a press conference in Geneva on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WHO assessed the risk of spread of the Nipah virus regionally and globally and found it low, he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two cases of Nipah were &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1969509&quot;&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; last month in India’s West Bengal state, while one patient died in Bangladesh last week after contracting the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The two outbreaks were not related, although both occurred along the India-Bangladesh border, and share some of the same ecological and cultural conditions, as well as populations of the species of fruit bat that are known to be the natural reservoir of Nipah virus,” Tedros said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/world/#indian-nurse-infected-with-nipah-virus-dies&quot; id=&quot;indian-nurse-infected-with-nipah-virus-dies&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Indian nurse infected with Nipah virus dies&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, an Indian health worker who contracted the Nipah virus in December has died, a senior health official from the eastern state of West Bengal said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The woman — a nurse — was one of two people in the state who were infected and was being treated at a local hospital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The woman … who was critical, died due to cardiac arrest,” Health Secretary Narayan Swaroop Nigam told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nipah was first identified in 1998 after it spread among pig farmers in Malaysia. In India, the first Nipah outbreak was reported in West Bengal in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2018, at least 17 people died from Nipah in Kerala, and in 2023, two people died from the virus in the same southern Indian state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symptoms include intense fever, vomiting and a respiratory infection, but severe cases can involve seizures and brain inflammation that results in a coma.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Bangladesh elections: Islamist-led coalition hopes for chance at power</title>
      <link>https://www.france24.com/en/tv-shows/focus/20260212-bangladesh-elections-islamist-led-coalition-hopes-for-chance-at-power</link>
      <description>Bangladesh has held its first elections since a student revolution deposed autocratic leader Sheikh Hasina in 2024. Hasina&apos;s main rival, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), is now projected to win. Yet the biggest development is the resurgence of the Islamist party Jamaat-e-Islami, which was banned under Hasina. Minorities targeted in recent mob violence and some women now fear for their rights. FRANCE 24&apos;s Navodita Kumari, Alban Alvarez and Muktadir Rashid report.</description>

      <description>“People in Bangladesh are exciting that democracy is returning and that there&apos;s a free and fair election,” explains Dr. Sohela Nazneed, Senior Fellow at the Institute of Development Studies in Brighton, speaking to Oliver Farry on FRANCE 24. The country goes to the polls after 17 years of authoritarianism, with voters concerned about who will win, what policies will be implemented, and key issues such as breaking the concentration of power, tackling corruption, economic development and social rights.</description>

      <title>Counting begins in landmark Bangladesh elections after Gen Z revolution</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/counting-begins-in-landmark-bangladesh-elections-after-gen-z-revolution</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Counting began on Thursday in Bangladesh’s first election since a deadly 2024 uprising and the subsequent student-led revolution, with powerful political heir &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt; bullish about defeating a coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters lined up outside polling stations in Dhaka in the hugely anticipated election, while key party leaders have raised fears of threats or “conspiracies” to derail the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rahman, 60, said he was “confident” his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) could regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he faces a stiff challenge from a coalition led by the Muslim-majority country’s Jamaat-i-Islami party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If people in Bangladesh come out to cast their votes, conspiracies will not succeed,” Tarique said after voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polls closed at 4:30pm (3:30 PKT), with the first significant results potentially expected overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With around 128m people eligible to vote, turnout reached a high 32.88 per cent by noon at about three-fourths of the 42,651 polling centres across the country, Akhtar Ahmed, senior secretary of the Election Commission, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were no reports of major violence, but a BNP leader died in a scuffle outside a polling booth in the coastal town of Khulna, and two paramilitary personnel and a 13-year old girl were injured when a home-made bomb exploded outside a polling booth in Hasina’s stronghold of Gopalganj.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around 958,000 personnel from the police, army and paramilitary forces were deployed throughout the country on election day, the Election Commission said. Police and army personnel were stationed outside most polling booths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commission officials reported “a few minor disruptions” but top party leaders on both sides raised fears of threats.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was my first vote,” said Shithi Goswami, 21, a student at Dhaka City College. “I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat, who have campaigned on a platform of justice and ending corruption, sense their biggest opportunity in decades, with party leader Rahman saying it “will do whatever is required” to ensure a fair result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UN experts warned ahead of voting of “growing intolerance, threats and attacks”, and a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972525&quot;&gt;tsunami of disinformation&lt;/a&gt;”, especially targeting millions of young first-time voters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls vary widely, though most give the BNP the lead — with some suggesting a knife-edge race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During campaigning, political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600, police records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin said the vote was going “smoothly in a free and fair manner”, with “a few minor disruptions” — noting the main threat was a flood of disinformation on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;Muhammad Yunus&lt;/a&gt;, who will step down once the new government takes power, has said the vote “will determine the future direction of the country”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led the South Asian nation since Hasina’s 15-year rule ended with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;her ouster&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His administration has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951958/bangladeshs-sheikh-hasina-warns-of-mass-voter-boycott-as-her-party-barred-from-election&quot;&gt;barred her&lt;/a&gt; Awami League party from contesting the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, 78, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; in absentia for crimes against humanity for the bloody crackdown on protesters during her final months in power, and remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus, speaking after voting, said that the country had “ended the nightmare and begun a new dream”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#spirit-of-the-uprising&quot; id=&quot;spirit-of-the-uprising&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Spirit of the uprising’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 127m voters were also voting in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972702/why-is-bangladesh-holding-a-national-referendum-alongside-its-general-election&quot;&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; on whether to endorse proposals for prime-ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeasin Arafat Emon, 25, said he had backed the charter as it “reflects the spirit of the uprising”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters will elect 300 lawmakers directly, with a further 50 women chosen from party lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several voters were conflicted about participating in the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some are determined to cast their ballots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. “Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next government will inherit a battered economy in the world’s second-largest garment exporter, as well as delicate relations with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s Tarique — whose late parents both led the country — told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; ahead of the vote that his first priority, if elected, would be restoring security and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he warned the challenges ahead were immense, and that “the economy has been destroyed”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Bangladesh is holding its first parliamentary elections since the ousting of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2024, with voters electing 300 lawmakers directly and 50 women from party lists. The main contenders are the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and the Islamist-led Jamaat coalition, as Hasina’s Awami Party has been barred from participating.</description>

      <title>High turnout as Bangladeshis vote in landmark election after Gen Z revolution</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/high-turnout-as-bangladeshis-vote-in-landmark-election-after-gen-z-revolution</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh voted on Thursday in its first election since a deadly 2024 uprising, as parties crushed under Sheikh Hasina’s rule return to the fray with a powerful political heir facing a coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters lined up outside polling stations in Dhaka in the hugely anticipated election, while key party leaders have raised fears of threats or “conspiracies” to derail the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With around 128 million people eligible to vote, turnout reached a high 32.88 per cent by noon at about three-fourths of the 42,651 polling centres across the country, Akhtar Ahmed, senior secretary of the Election Commission, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 300,000 soldiers and police are deployed countrywide, with UN experts warning ahead of voting of “growing intolerance, threats and attacks”, and a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972525&quot;&gt;tsunami of disinformation&lt;/a&gt;”, especially targeting millions of young first-time voters.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full  w-full  media--left  media--embed  &quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--youtube  &quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was my first vote,” said Shithi Goswami, 21, a student at Dhaka City College. “I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading prime ministerial hopeful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, 60, said he was “confident” his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) could regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he faces a stiff challenge from a coalition led by the Muslim-majority country’s Jamaat-i-Islami party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If people in Bangladesh come out to cast their votes, conspiracies will not succeed,” Tarique said after voting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat, who have campaigned on a platform of justice and ending corruption, sense their biggest opportunity in decades, with party leader Rahman saying it “will do whatever is required” to ensure a fair result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls vary widely, though most give the BNP the lead — with some suggesting a knife-edge race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During campaigning, political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600, police records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin said the vote was going “smoothly in a free and fair manner”, with “a few minor disruptions” — noting the main threat was a flood of disinformation on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Voters will elect 300 lawmakers directly, with a further 50 women chosen from party lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting by hand begins after polls close at 4:30pm (3:30pm PKT), with first significant results expected potentially overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several voters are conflicted about participating in the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next government will inherit a battered economy in the world’s second-largest garment exporter, as well as delicate relations with India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The BNP’s Tarique — whose late parents both led the country — told &lt;em&gt;AFP&lt;/em&gt; ahead of the vote that his first priority, if elected, would be restoring security and stability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he warned the challenges ahead were immense, and that “the economy has been destroyed”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;President Asif Ali Zardari said he hoped for a peaceful election process in Bangladesh, according to a post by the president’s official account on social media platform X on Thursday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“President Asif Ali Zardari extends best wishes to the people of Bangladesh as over 127 million voters head to the polls today to elect representatives to 300 seats,” the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He expressed hope for “a peaceful process that strengthens democracy and stability”, the post added.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>A hand grenade exploded at a polling station in Bangladesh’s Gopalganj district, injuring three people during national elections. The attack heightened security concerns as voters cast ballots in a closely contested parliamentary race. Election staff, voters, and local residents were directly affected by the explosion.

      <title>Bangladesh votes in landmark polls after Gen Z revolution</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1972693/bangladesh-votes-in-landmark-polls-after-gen-z-revolution</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bangladesh voted on Thursday in its first election since a deadly 2024 uprising, as parties crushed under Sheikh Hasina’s rule return to the fray with a powerful political heir facing a coalition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters lined up outside polling stations in Dhaka in the hugely anticipated election, while key party leaders have raised fears of threats or “conspiracies” to derail the vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is the world’s first election after a revolution led by under-30s, or Gen Z, to be followed by Nepal next month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More than 300,000 soldiers and police are deployed countrywide, with UN experts warning ahead of voting of “growing intolerance, threats and attacks”, and a “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972525&quot;&gt;tsunami of disinformation&lt;/a&gt;”, especially targeting millions of young first-time voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Dhaka, the capital, people queued up outside voting booths before polls opened at 7:30am local time (0130 GMT), including eager participants like Mohammed Jobair Hossain, 39, who said he last voted in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I am feeling excited because we are voting in a free manner after 17 years,” Hossain said as he waited in line. “Our votes will matter and have meaning.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This was my first vote,” said Shithi Goswami, 21, a student at Dhaka City College. “I hope after everything we went through the last few years, now is the time for something positive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leading prime ministerial hopeful &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972259&quot;&gt;Tarique Rahman&lt;/a&gt;, 60, said he was “confident” his Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) could regain power in the South Asian nation of 170 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;figure class=&quot;media  w-full sm:w-1/2  media--right  media--embed  media--uneven&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;media__item  media__item--newskitlink  &quot;&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;
        
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he faces a stiff challenge from a coalition led by the Muslim-majority country’s Jamaat-i-Islami party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If people in Bangladesh come out to cast their votes, conspiracies will not succeed,” Tarique said after voting.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat chief Shafiqur Rahman, 67, has mounted a disciplined grassroots campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jamaat, who have campaigned on a platform of justice and ending corruption, sense their biggest opportunity in decades, with party leader Rahman saying it “will do whatever is required” to ensure a fair result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#ended-the-nightmare&quot; id=&quot;ended-the-nightmare&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Ended the nightmare’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Opinion polls vary widely, though most give the BNP the lead — with some suggesting a knife-edge race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During campaigning, political clashes killed five people and injured more than 600, police records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Election Commissioner AMM Nasir Uddin said the vote was going “smoothly in a free and fair manner”, with “a few minor disruptions” — noting the main threat was a flood of disinformation on social media.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interim leader &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850894&quot;&gt;Muhammad Yunus&lt;/a&gt;, who will step down once the new government takes power, has said the vote “will determine the future direction of the country”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 85-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner has led the South Asian nation since Hasina’s 15-year rule ended with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1850245&quot;&gt;her ouster&lt;/a&gt; in August 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His administration has &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1951958/bangladeshs-sheikh-hasina-warns-of-mass-voter-boycott-as-her-party-barred-from-election&quot;&gt;barred her&lt;/a&gt; Awami League party from contesting the polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina, 78, was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1955627&quot;&gt;sentenced to death&lt;/a&gt; in absentia for crimes against humanity for the bloody crackdown on protesters during her final months in power, and remains in hiding in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yunus, speaking after voting, said that the country had “ended the nightmare and begun a new dream”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;heading-permalink&quot; href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/feeds/latest-news/#spirit-of-the-uprising&quot; id=&quot;spirit-of-the-uprising&quot; title=&quot;Permalink&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;‘Spirit of the uprising’&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has championed a sweeping democratic reform charter to overhaul what he called a “completely broken” system of government and to prevent a return to one-party rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 127m voters are also voting in a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.dawn.com/news/1972702/why-is-bangladesh-holding-a-national-referendum-alongside-its-general-election&quot;&gt;referendum&lt;/a&gt; on whether to endorse proposals for prime-ministerial term limits, a new upper house of parliament, stronger presidential powers and greater judicial independence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yeasin Arafat Emon, 25, said he had backed the charter as it “reflects the spirit of the uprising”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voters will elect 300 lawmakers directly, with a further 50 women chosen from party lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Counting by hand begins after polls close at 4:30pm (3:30pm PKT), with first significant results expected potentially overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several voters are conflicted about participating in the election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some, like rickshaw puller Chan Mia, say they cannot afford to travel to their villages to vote and lose their daily income in Dhaka. Others, such as gatekeeper Mohammad Sabuj, feel disillusioned because Hasina’s party is barred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But some are determined to cast their ballots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“During Hasina’s time, we couldn’t cast our votes,” said Shakil Ahmed, a driver. “Its my right to vote. This time, I won’t miss it.”&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bangladesh votes in its first election since the 2024 Gen Z uprising that ousted Hasina</title>

      <description>Voters across Bangladesh are casting ballots in a parliamentary election seen as a key test for the country’s democracy after years of political unrest. More than 127 million people are eligible to vote in the first election since former prime minister Sheikh Hasina’s government collapsed in 2024 following mass protests often described as a Gen Z-led uprising. Results are expected on Friday, as FRANCE 24&apos;s Navodita Kumari explains.</description>
