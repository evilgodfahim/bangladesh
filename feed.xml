      <title>Bangladesh, course-correcting its economy</title>
      <link>https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/bangladesh-course-correcting-its-economy/articleshow/126054974.cms</link>
      <description>Bangladesh anticipates a February 12 election, boosting investor sentiment. Despite strong headline growth, structural issues persist. Foreign direct investment shows mixed signals, with reinvested earnings and intra-company loans driving growth, while new equity capital declines. Macroeconomic indicators present a mixed picture, with inflation easing but remaining elevated. Remittance flows remain robust, supporting reserves.</description>

      <title>Want to understand the sickness of Britain today? Look no further – a novel explained it all 20 years ago | Aditya Chakrabortty</title>
      <link>https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/18/sickness-britain-novel-20-years-ago-jg-ballard</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The racism, the predatory politics, the banality and cruelty: we struggle to make sense of it, but JG Ballard foretold everything we are living through now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Englishman drives into a new town and can’t see the warning signs. Richard Pearson is visiting Surrey to close down his late father’s home and settle his affairs and, everywhere he looks, the flag of St George is flying “from suburban gardens and filling stations and branch post offices”. How nice, he thinks, how festive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Soon he learns the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So runs the opening not of a recent piece of journalism, but a novel by JG Ballard, Kingdom Come, which despite being almost 20 years old anticipates today’s Britain with eerie precision. In the mid-2000s, Pearson reads up on his new surroundings, only to find the same headlines that assail us in the mid-2020s: “Every day the local newspaper reported attacks on an asylum hotel, the torching of a Bangladeshi takeaway, injuries to a Kosovan youth thrown over the fence into an industrial estate.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aditya Chakrabortty is a Guardian columnist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/dec/18/sickness-britain-novel-20-years-ago-jg-ballard"&gt;Continue reading...&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>Dhaka’s already strained relationship with New Delhi has come under fresh pressure after a Bangladeshi opposition leader threatened to shelter separatists targeting India’s sensitive northeast region in retaliation for what he claimed to be election interference.
Hasnat Abdullah, a leader of the newly formed National Citizen Party (NCP), warned at a rally in Dhaka on Monday that he would carry out the move if Bangladesh believed India was trying to influence its election in February.

      <title>51,000 passengers offloaded after failing immigration checks this year, FIA tells NA panel</title>
      <link>https://www.dawn.com/news/1961655/51000-passengers-offloaded-after-failing-immigration-checks-this-year-fia-tells-na-panel</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Overseas Pakistanis, chaired by Aga Rafiullah, was informed on Wednesday that 51,000 passengers were offloaded at Pakistani airports this year after failing immigration checks, with a large number of them being offloaded at Lahore and Karachi airports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, numerous incidents have been reported of travellers being &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1891979"&gt;offloaded&lt;/a&gt; from flights at various airports, despite possessing valid travel documents. These actions followed a &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1885931"&gt;crackdown&lt;/a&gt; on migrant smuggling launched after the 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1878730/5-dead-after-migrant-boat-with-many-pakistanis-capsizes-off-greek-island"&gt;Greece boat tragedy&lt;/a&gt;, which claimed several Pakistani lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also ordered the formation of a &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1961398"&gt;committee&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the frequent offloading of passengers from international flights, an issue that has reportedly affected numerous travellers despite them holding valid documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Director General of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Riffat Mukhtar Raja informed the committee that, “Passengers are offloaded on the basis of document verification, data checks, and online authentication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Raja told the parliamentary panel that of the 66,000 passengers offloaded this year, 51,000 were stopped by the FIA for insufficient or unverified documentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that many of those offloaded lacked complete information related to their courses, universities or employment details abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In many cases, passengers attempt to travel through agents using incomplete or incorrect information,” DG FIA added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The committee was further informed that 180 FIA officials involved in corruption had been dismissed from service, while all major airports had been connected to NADRA’s online database to strengthen immigration controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No passenger was cleared under political influence or VIP pressure,” he stressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The official further informed the lawmakers that cameras have been installed at immigration counters at airports and that monitoring is being carried out from the control headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The immigration system is using artificial intelligence to identify suspicious cases in advance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added that most offloaded passengers belonged to the visit, Umrah and work visa categories. During the current year, 8.5 million people travelled abroad from Pakistan, while 226 cases were registered for various offences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the past three months, 450 people were arrested while attempting to cross into Iran illegally,” the DG FIA told the committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also revealed that several Bangladeshi nationals were found attempting to travel illegally to Europe via Pakistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Bangladeshi citizens travelling on Pakistani tourist visas were caught while heading to Europe,” added DG FIA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He further stated that 287 people were deported last year and 170 this year over the use of fake documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parliamentary panel was also told that 24,000 accused of begging have been deported from Saudi Arabia this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a class="heading-permalink" href="https://www.dawn.com/feeds/home/#1-trillion-investment-coming-to-saudi-arabia-opportunities-to-increase-for-pakistanis" id="1-trillion-investment-coming-to-saudi-arabia-opportunities-to-increase-for-pakistanis" title="Permalink"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;$1 trillion investment coming to Saudi Arabia; opportunities to increase for Pakistanis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Secretary Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry informed the committee that investment worth $1 trillion is coming to Saudi Arabia under Saudi Vision 2030, creating multiple employment opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If we can provide better training to skilled manpower, Pakistan can benefit from these opportunities,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The secretary told the committee that 451,000 Pakistanis travelled to Saudi Arabia last year, while more than 500,000 Pakistanis have been sent to Saudi Arabia during the current year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chairman of the committee Agha Rafiullah said that the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission was “not functioning at all”, adding that officers posted there were temporarily fixing matters instead of resolving them permanently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Committee member Muhammad Ilyas Chaudhry said drivers have been provided to community welfare attachés, questioning how Grade 17–18 officers were being assigned drivers in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said “more than 50 per cent of community welfare attachés have been provided drivers”, asking whether the ministry was aware of the cost of providing a driver to a Grade 17 officer in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Community welfare attachés are officials of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis, posted abroad to assist Pakistani migrant workers, safeguard their interests, and provide legal or financial protection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said that “no passenger with &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1958147"&gt;complete travel documents&lt;/a&gt; is being stopped from travelling, and they will not be stopped,” adding that, however, passengers in possession of “incomplete or bogus documents will definitely not be allowed to travel”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“No passenger who brings disrepute to the country can be allowed to travel,” he further stated, according to PTV News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, the FIA &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1957696"&gt;&lt;u&gt;clarified&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that people were only being offloaded or denied boarding if they did not have valid documents or if authorities suspected them of working with migrant smugglers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same day, the agency also&lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1957732"&gt;&lt;u&gt; initiated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; legal action against those involved in spreading fabricated information on social media regarding the offloading of passengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FIA Director General Riffat Mukhtar had also &lt;a href="https://www.dawn.com/news/1953505"&gt;&lt;u&gt;acknowledged &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;that incidents of people being offloaded had been reported at Lahore and Karachi airports, and that investigations were underway.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;span&gt;Chatham House in 2025: A message from the Director&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;News release&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Institute Director and Chief Executive Bronwen Maddox reviews Chatham House’s response to an extraordinary year of turbulence in international affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;It is fair to say that 2025 was always going to be unsettled and unpredictable, but by any measure, it has been an extraordinary year – a period of geopolitical turbulence in which Chatham House has often found itself at the centre. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have seen some of the world’s most influential leaders come through our iconic blue front door, keen to debate and engage on the biggest topics of the day at one of the world’s premier discussion venues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;

        &lt;div class="video-embed-field-lazy"&gt;&lt;img alt="alt" height="422" src="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/16_9_media_small/public/video_thumbnails/dGCujQRYhAg.jpg?h=c673cd1c&amp;amp;itok=gPa2aZ9p" width="750" /&gt;

&lt;button class="video-embed-field-lazy-play"&gt;&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;figcaption&gt;— &lt;p&gt;A review of an extraordinary year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They included Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy; NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte; Dr Comfort Ero, President of the International Crisis Group; former Vice President of the United States Mike Pence; President of Israel Isaac Herzog; Foreign Minister of Syria Asaad Al-Shaibani and many others. All as part of &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/about-us/our-mission-and-values" title="Our mission and values"&gt;Chatham House’s mission&lt;/a&gt; to address geopolitical challenges and international problems, and to convene meetings of the people and organizations that can bring about change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have also been proud to see our staff and associates respond to geopolitical turbulence by producing in-depth publications with recommendations and policy impact generated through evidence-based research and discussions with policymakers. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my Director’s Lecture at the start of this year, I spoke about the importance of finding agreement in this new fluid, contested world. That remains true. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;US foreign policy reversal &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Donald Trump’s paradigm shift in US foreign policy during his second term has affected almost every aspect of our work and has been the catalyst of many world events.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeping trade tariffs, military strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and Venezuelan ‘drug cartels’, dismantling US overseas aid and questioning international laws and norms – all these have kept our experts busy analysing what this means for the rest of the world. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many conversations were hosted at Chatham House on the implications both publicly and privately. As well as Mike Pence, key speakers from the US included former US Secretary of State and Climate Envoy John Kerry and US Principal Deputy National Security Advisor Jon Finer. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our experts analysed Trump’s second UK state visit and scrutinized other countries’ attempts to gain favour with the president – not least European leaders over the war in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Future of Europe &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That ongoing war, increased Russian ‘grey zone’ aggression, and the crisis facing European leaders over defence, security and economic competitiveness, have been central themes of our work this year. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June we were honoured to welcome President Zelenskyy to Chatham House, and other Ukrainian figures such as Ukrainian Ambassador to the UK, Valerii Zaluzhnyi.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;European leaders included Elina Valtonen, Finland’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alistair Carns, UK Minister for the Armed Forces and more, all warning audiences about the need for Europe to wean itself off dependency on the US and bolster its own defence industries. Our Berlin conference in December on ‘Europe’s Strategic Choices’ analysed Europe’s urgent need to respond to new US policy and to China. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our renowned security and defence conference convened sober discussions and our Ukraine Forum continues to lead the field in discussions about Ukrainian politics and civil society. Experts dissected key moments such as the White House ‘ambush’ of Zelenskyy in February, Trump and Putin’s surprise Alaska summit, and continuing battlefield clashes. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Middle East turmoil &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The war in Gaza, its catastrophic humanitarian impact and its domino effect on the region continued to dominate the work of our Middle East programme and beyond.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, I called upon the UK government to &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/07/uk-should-recognize-palestinian-state-now" title="The UK should recognize a Palestinian state now"&gt;recognize the State of Palestine&lt;/a&gt;, and we received both Husam Zomlot, Palestinian Ambassador to the UK as well as Isaac Herzog, President of Israel, on the Chatham House stage, in addition to numerous private roundtables on the conflict. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;

        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Our experts were much in demand to provide analysis about the milestone US air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our experts were much in demand to provide analysis about the milestone US air strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities and other significant developments including Israel’s September air strike on Doha, a key US ally in the Middle East, its attacks against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and tackling the threat to shipping from Yemeni Houthis in the Red Sea. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad Al-Shaibani drew enormous interest when he spoke at Chatham House, marking his first public appearance in the UK since the fall of the Assad regime, and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani addressed our seventh annual Iraq Initiative Conference during a pivotal election year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;China &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our researchers have examined China’s ever-increasing influence on global affairs and what its ambitions for the world might be – particularly in light of the US retreat from multilateralism. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through events and research, we have explored the China–US rivalry, interrogated China’s regional competition with India, examined Beijing’s desire to establish itself as an AI superpower that sets the global rules in this new technological arena, and made recommendations about how the UK government should engage with China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our experts have also looked at China as a ‘reluctant climate leader’ ahead of COP30 and analysed China’s clean tech charm offensive. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers have provided analysis on Chinese espionage in light of the China spy case and the UK’s indecision over approving the Chinese embassy in London. We’ve commented on China’s show of power at its annual Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, and at the victory parade attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of our work also focused on the West’s and China’s engagement with the Global South.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Global South and a new order &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is clear that many nations no longer want to be wholly aligned with superpowers such as the US or China. A new multilateralism is emerging in which emerging nations are seeking the chance to influence rules and alliances. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We hosted key speakers, including Nigerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yusuf M. Tuggar; Indian External Affairs Minister, Dr. S Jaishankar; Chief Adviser of Bangladesh, Professor Muhammad Yunus; Philippine Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Enrique A Manalo; Senior Minister of Singapore, Lee Hsien Loong and many more, all to discuss how emerging economies are responding to the turmoil of 2025. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class="media__wrapper"&gt;
          &lt;div class="media__content"&gt;
        &lt;svg class="icon icon--open-quote" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"&gt;
          &lt;use xlink:href="#icon-open-quote" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Our experts produced research on topics such as the role of the illicit gold trade in Sudan’s brutal war.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
            
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Africa programme’s longstanding SNAG project on corruption in Nigeria culminated in a conference in Abuja, and our experts produced research on topics such as the role of the &lt;a href="https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/03/gold-and-war-sudan" title="Gold and the war in Sudan"&gt;illicit gold trade&lt;/a&gt; in Sudan’s brutal war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this is just a small fraction of the vital work carried out by Chatham House this year. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The policy impact that our experts had is also worthy of mention. This included delivering evidence to UK parliamentary select committees on issues from European security to nuclear proliferation; playing a crucial role in pushing through the UN resolution that approved the 5,500-strong ‘Gang Suppression Force’ to restore security in Haiti; and influencing negotiations on the Global Plastics Treaty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are grateful for all those who continue to support Chatham House, those speakers who are willing to have their ideas tested and questioned in our forums and for the many people who make our work possible. We look forward to whatever 2026 might bring. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>On Victory Day, Bangladesh students highlighted 1971 atrocities of the Pakistan Army and their local collaborators. At Jahangirnagar University, a "Monument of Hatred" exhibition featured collaborators' photos, with students throwing trash at them. Several photographs of Razakars hung on a pole in front of the university's old arts building on the Victory Day.</description>

      <title>Changing Bangladesh: Where Women Are Silently Rewriting the Rules of Society</title>
      <link>https://southasiamonitor.org/spotlight/changing-bangladesh-where-women-are-silently-rewriting-rules-society</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The expansion of education in Bangladesh has played a key role in this transformation. Girls are now equal to boys in schools, colleges, and universities and sometimes even ahead of them. Women have proven their capabilities as doctors, engineers, teachers, researchers, and even pilots. This achievement is not just personal;  this is the evolution of the mentality of a society.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;UN secretary general António Guterres says ‘unjustifiable’ attack on base in city of Kadugli ‘could be war crime’&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A drone strike has hit a United Nations peacekeeping logistics base in war-torn Sudan, killing six peacekeepers, the UN secretary general António Guterres has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eight other peacekeepers were wounded in the strike on Saturday in the city of Kadugli in the central region of Kordofan.

      <title>Bangladesh needs a democratic reset. Will the election deliver it?</title>

      <description>&lt;span&gt;Bangladesh needs a democratic reset. Will the election deliver it?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span&gt;The World Today&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;iallan.drupal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;time datetime="2025-12-09T08:49:54+00:00" title="Tuesday, 9 December, 2025"&gt;9 December 2025&lt;/time&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In the country’s first electoral test since Sheikh Hasina was ousted from power, a continuing cycle of ‘revenge politics’ and economic instability dampen hopes for democratic reform, writes James Orr.&lt;/p&gt;

  



  &lt;div class="media media-teaser_landscape_rss media-image"&gt;
                        &lt;img alt="protestors climb a statue holding the Bangladesh flag" height="600" src="https://www.chathamhouse.org/sites/default/files/styles/chat_social_twitter_1200_600/public/2025-12/2025-12-08-twt-winter-2025-bangladesh-hero.jpg?itok=_5m4O7e4" width="1200" /&gt;

  




            &lt;/div&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;Bangladesh will go to the polls on 12 February as the country seeks to reconcile a decades-long era of ‘revenge politics’ and return to a more democratic footing. Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel peace laureate who has led an interim government since the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in August 2024, has faced pressure to hold a general election before Ramadan commences in mid-February.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The three-time prime minister was toppled from power after weeks of student-led protests against her Awami League government, which faced accusations of corruption.&amp;nbsp;Analysts believe the most likely outcome of February’s vote will be a return to power for the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), led by acting chairman&amp;nbsp;Tarique Rahman, 60, who has lived in exile in London for nearly two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Referendum on the July Charter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether new leadership can implement reform and deliver on promises to restructure the country’s electoral, constitutional and administrative bodies – as 25 parties agreed to in the July Charter in 2025 – is an open question. Public support for ratifying these reforms will be put to the test in a referendum in February.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘What happened last August – the so-called Monsoon revolution – was referred to as the country’s second liberation, but I think the reality will be more continuity than change,’ said Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow for South Asia at Chatham House’s Asia-Pacific Programme. ‘In terms of the cycle of often violent revenge politics that we’ve witnessed throughout Bangladesh’s history, we haven’t really seen any movement towards a genuine national reconciliation. We merely see the pendulum swinging from one extreme to the other.’ According to the United Nations, up to 1,400 people died during the crackdown on protests last year, the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its 1971 War of Independence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class="align-right embedded-entity embed"&gt;&lt;figure class="media media-embed media-quote"&gt;
  
  &lt;blockquote class="media__wrapper"&gt;
          &lt;div class="media__content"&gt;

          &lt;use xlink:href="#icon-open-quote" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"&gt;
        &lt;/svg&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;What happened last August was referred to as the country’s second liberation, but I think the reality will be more continuity than change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
              &lt;cite&gt;Chietigj Bajpaee, senior research fellow for South Asia, Asia-Pacific Programme, Chatham House.&lt;/cite&gt;
        
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hasina was forced to flee by helicopter to India just hours before demonstrators stormed her residence in the capital Dhaka. In November, a special tribunal court in Bangladesh sentenced her in absentia to death for crimes against humanity, including her role in ordering the crackdown on protesters. Hasina remains in exile under the protection of the Indian government, which is unlikely to allow her extradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months before the conviction, her Awami League party – which held power for 15 years – was banned from taking part in next year’s election. Many fear this decision could undermine the vote’s legitimacy. ‘The most likely outcome does seem to be that the BNP will win and that the Jamaat-e-Islami party [Bangladesh’s largest Islamist party ] will be the main opposition,’ said Naomi Hossain, a professor of Development Studies at SOAS University of London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;‘But the BNP are very unpopular and people will be holding their noses and voting. Anyone who&amp;nbsp;remembers them from the early 2000s will recall how violent, thuggish and corrupt they were,’ she said.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

						The Hasina case contributes to global perceptions that accountability is selective and confirms the best way for autocrats to escape justice is to never relinquish power.</description>
